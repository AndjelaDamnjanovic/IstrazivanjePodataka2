Five sections of the polypeptidechain are either invisible, or poorly defined in the electron density map. For the first molecule of the dimer in the asymmetric unit they are A174 to A179 (the N terminus of the C-terminal domain), A294 to A334, A401 to A405, A427 to A432 and A454 to A464 whilst for the second molecule they are B174 to B179, B293 to B334, B344 to B349, B401 to B405 and B454 to B464.

the CD spectrum of LL-37 in water exhibits a minimum around 200 nm, which is indicative of a highly disordered conformation
Taken together, this highly cooperative concentration-dependent helix-coil equilibrium is highly reminiscent of the monomer-oligomer transitions common to peptide sequences capable of forming amphipathic α-helices (e.g. melittin; Ref. 27).
15 mmNaCl affects the structure of LL-37 to a very limited extent (Fig. 2 B), and replacement of Na+ with Mg2+ does not have any effect on the structural transitions observed, which shows that the structural changes are predominantly caused by the SO42−, HCO3−, and CF3CO2−anions.
The helical, oligomeric conformation of LL-37 is apparently a requirement for activity, since the highest antibacterial activity correlates to maximal helical content, while intermediate and low activities correspond to less helical content and disordered secondary structure (Fig. 5).
The minimal inhibitory concentration of LL-37 againstE. coli is 5 μm, and at 13–25 μm the peptide is cytotoxic against several eukaryotic cells.
The cytotoxic effect of LL-37 was determined by the ability of intracellular eukaryotic esterases to hydrolyze fluorescein diacetate (FDA) to free fluorescein, followed by flow cytometric analysis (23).
Our data show that the active helical conformation of LL-37 is cytotoxic to eukaryotic cells in the ion compositions and at pH values that are encountered under physiological conditions.
We found that hLL-3717–29 formed long (several micrometers and longer), ribbon-like, fibrils, visualized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 2).
Cryogenic electron microscopy (CryoEM) showed that the wide (few hundred nanometers) fibrils are composed of lateral association of thinner fibrils (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Our determination of the crystal structure of hLL-3717–29 at 1.35 Å resolution, revealed self-assembly of amphipathic helices into a densely packed and elongated hexameric structure forming a central pore (Table 1, Fig. 3 and Supplementary Movie 1). 
Using NMR spectroscopy, we also show that N is disordered in solution.
Heteronuclear magnetic resonance experiments demonstrate that N is a disordered protein.
 It can be concluded, therefore, that the full-length N protein and its smaller fragments are disordered in solution.
Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was used to characterize the bacteriophage  λ N protein, a 107 residue intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that functions as a transcriptional antitermination factor.
The average radius of gyration from these measurements was 38 ± 3.5 Å, significantly larger than the value predicted for a denaturant-unfolded protein of 107 residues (31 ± 0.1 Å from Eq. (1) and the experimental data compiled by Kohn et al.13).
This suggests that N exists in solution as an unfolded protein.
This conclusion is also supported by circular dichroism (CD) measurements of the uncomplexed N protein. Figure 3B shows that free N protein at 20 °C manifests only a weak CD signal at 223 nm, corresponding to a calculated (from CD) α-helix content of approximately 18%. However, further CD measurements showed that this level of apparent secondary structure is not significantly altered by changing the temperature, and CD melting curves showed that no cooperative melting occurs between 20 and 95 °C (M.R.V.G., unpublished results).
These observations are consistent with the existence of N in solution as an essentially unstructured molecule containing some (fluctuating and transient) secondary structure (Psitsyn, 1987; Kim & Baldwin, 1990).
We have shown above that N protein exists in solution as an unfolded (essentially random coil) molecule.
Binding of Nonspecific RNA Does Not Induce α-Helical Structure in N Protein. In principle, the change in secondary structure that occurs when N binds to boxB RNA could be a requirement for (or the result of) specific binding. However, it could also be a trivial consequence of the binding of N to any RNA or DNA oligonucleotide. To test the latter hypothesis, we measured the CD spectrum of N protein bound to the nonspecific (scrambled) single-stranded RNA oligomer used in the binding studies (above). Based on the measured nonspecific Kd of ∼1 × 10-6 M for this oligomer (Figure 2C and Table 1), the RNA oligomer concentration that was used in this experiment should have formed a complex with ∼70% of the total N protein present. Figure 5A shows no observable change in ellipticity for either the N protein or the RNA component on nonspecific complex formation. We conclude that the N protein binds nonspecific RNA in essentially its unstructured solution form.
Binding of nonspecific RNA is assessed using CD, and authors specify that ∼70% of N should be complexed with the RNAs used, therefore it is not possible to determine which part of the protein is specifically involved in the binding.

These observations are consistent with the existence of N in solution as an essentially unstructured molecule containing some (fluctuating and transient) secondary structure (Psitsyn, 1987; Kim & Baldwin, 1990).
A two-dimensional HSMQC NMR analysis was performed on the uncomplexed 15N-labeled N protein at 20 °C (Figure 3A). Peaks corresponding to 100 of the 107 residues of N can be resolved, but the amide resonances are sharp and clustered in the center where they have chemical shifts consistent with those of a random coil structure. This suggests that N exists in solution as an unfolded protein.
Furthermore, on the NMR time-scale we find no significant secondary or tertiary structure interactions.
We have shown that the N protein is also unfolded when free in solution and that it is capable of activating RNA polymerase in this form, though we have no information on its structural state after binding to the transcription complex.
The N proteins of the lambdoid family and the Tat protein of HIV are all RNA binding transcriptional activators.

Intrinsic Disorder Allows λN to Implement a Multi-pronged Anti-pausing and Anti-termination Strategy
Our results suggest that λN can bestow pause and termination resistance on the transcriptional apparatus by three main mechanisms.
First, λN globally repositions NusA.
Second, λN locally remodels RNAP elements.
Third, λN seems to stabilize RNAP and nucleic acids to promote processive elongation.
C-terminal parts of λN that traverse the hybrid cavity may avert pause-related conformational changes of RNAP, stabilize the hybrid, functionally insulate the exit tunnel from the active site, and possibly enhance the catalytic activity of RNAP via contacts to the connector.
Thus, λN resembles a molecular "Swiss army knife" with numerous tools that counteract essentially all modes of pausing and termination.
Remarkably, λN can comprehensively reprogram RNAP and elongation factors, although it is a very small protein (107 residues). Our results show that, due to its intrinsic disorder (VanGilst and von Hippel, 1997), it can adopt a highly elongated conformation that results in a large exposed interaction surface.
A 3.7-Å-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure and structure-informed functional analyses reveal a multi-pronged strategy by which the intrinsically unstructured λN directly modifies RNA polymerase interactions with the nucleic acids and subverts essential functions of NusA, NusE, and NusG to reprogram the transcriptional apparatus. λN repositions NusA and remodels the β subunit flap tip, which likely precludes folding of pause or termination RNA hairpins in the exit tunnel and disrupts termination-supporting interactions of the α subunit C-terminal domains. λN invades and traverses the RNA polymerase hybrid cavity, likely stabilizing the hybrid and impeding pause- or termination-related conformational changes of polymerase. λN also lines upstream DNA, seemingly reinforcing anti-backtracking and anti-swiveling by NusG. Moreover, λN-repositioned NusA and NusE sequester the NusG C-terminal domain, counteracting ρ-dependent termination. Other anti-terminators likely utilize similar mechanisms to enable processive transcription.
We have determined the structure of this complex by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy (P. L. et al., unpublished data) and concluded that changes in N1–22 chemical shifts caused by the addition of boxB RNA reflect both the folding of the arginine-rich domain and extensive interactions with its RNA target.
Interaction with boxB RNA induces only the RNA-binding domain of N to adopt a folded conformation, while the activating regions of the protein remain disordered in the absence of their target proteins.
When amino-terminal deletions of N1–47 fused to GST were used in these experiments, the smallest fragment that bound NusA was N34–47 (Figure 4B, lane 5).
To confirm the location of the NusA-binding region in amino acids 34–47 using an independent method (see Figure 4C), gel mobility shift assays were performed using 32P-labeled nut site RNA, purified NusA, and purified N (full-length N and various carboxy-terminal deletion mutants), as described previously (Mogridge et al. 1995). NusA did not form a complex with nut site RNA and N1–22, which contains only the boxB-binding region of N (lanes 3–5). NusA also did not supershift an N1–39/nut site complex (lanes 7–9), but did supershift the nut site RNA complexed with N1–47 (lanes 10–13), the longer N fragments, and full-length N (lanes 14–30). Thus, the results of the gel mobility shift assays were in accord with those of the affinity chromatography experiments.

L. et al., unpublished data) and concluded that changes in N1–22 chemical shifts caused by the addition of boxB RNA reflect both the folding of the arginine-rich domain and extensive interactions with its RNA target.
No appreciable effect was observed upon addition of N1–22, N1–39, N1–47, N1–58, N1–73, or N1–89 (lanes 2–7), but 69% read-through occurred in the presence of full-length N (lane 8). Thus, the carboxyl terminus of N is essential for its ability to support factor-independent antitermination.
The minimum near 200 nm in the far UV-CD spectra of free N protein and N36 peptide is characteristic for a random coil conformation (Fig. 2), consistent with the result of NMR spectroscopic studies.
Thus, the structural changes in the N protein which occur upon binding to boxB RNA are mainly localized within the 36 N-terminal amino acids of the N protein, as indicated previously [[12]].
A predominantly peripheral binding mechanism, rather than deep protein insertion into the membrane, provides a rationale for the general denaturing effect of the CL surface and the large-scale protein unfolding. These findings closely relate to cyt c folding dynamics and suggest a general strategy for extending the time window in monitoring the kinetics of folding.
Interactions of cytochrome c (cyt c) with cardiolipin (CL) partially unfold the protein activating its peroxidase function, a critical event in the execution of apoptosis.
A least squares analysis of the data gives an intrinsic viscosity of 15.5 ml per g. This value is nearly identical with an intrinsic viscosity of 15.2 ml per g calculated for the apoprotein in a randomly coiled conformation, using the equation of Tanford et al. (12). 
As seen in Fig. 2B, the fractionated apoprotein preparation exhibits negative
ellipticities between 195 and 235 nm with a minimum at 199 nm. A minimum at this wave length is characteristic of a randomly coiled conformation (15).
The N-terminal 42 residues were not visible in the electron density map.
Native AP Endo Contains a Flexible Amino-terminal Portion and a Tight Globular Domain
Because the first 36 residues of the amino terminus are readily accessible to proteolysis by all the proteases examined, they are flexible and only loosely associated with the remainder of the molecule.
Because the first 36 residues of the amino terminus are readily accessible to proteolysis by all the proteases examined, they are flexible and only loosely associated with the remainder of the molecule.
This electron density map allowed the interpretation of the majority of residues, although no electron density was visible for 12 N-terminal amino acids (including four vector-derived residues).
The N terminus (residues 1–40) was evidently flexible because it lacked unambiguous electron density.
The SAXS profiles of OctΔC1 and Bob1 indicated that both proteins do not have a folded, globular structure, and a Gaussian chainlike behavior was most appropriate to describe these experimental findings (Figure 4a).
As the polymer dimensions do not reflect the respective protein masses (OctΔC1 is nearly twice as large as Bob1), these results suggest that OctΔC1 retains some structured peptide segments, presumably from the POU domain, while Bob1 exists entirely as a random chain.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of Bob1 shows an apparent lack of, or a very broad, melting transition, indicating that Bob1 does not adopt a stable globular fold (data not shown).
The circular dichroism (CD) spectra of Bob1(1–65) and Bob1 are consistent with a poorly ordered fold, but there are additional features characteristic of polyproline II helix (Figure 6(b); Siligardi and Drake 1995, Sreerama and Woody 1994).
The CD spectra of the ternary complex indicate that the helical composition is greater then the expected value calculated from free Bob1(1–65) and the Oct-1 POU/DNA complex (Figure 6(c); Table 3).
The integrated heat release for titrations of Bob1 into the pre-formed Oct-1 POU/DNA complex (Figure 2(c)) shows that both Bob1(1–65) and Bob1 have an exothermic reaction with the stable, pre-formed POU/DNA complex.
Electrophoretic DNA mobility experiments showed that the protein is binding Oct-1 POU, not the DNA
In addition, the non-conserved region cover-ing TOA2 amino acids 89-103 is unobserved.
The 15 amino acids of hydrophilic sequence between strands 4 and 5 of TOA2 are unobserved in the structure. They correspond closely to the 14 extra and non-essential residues of the yeast small subunit compared to the human and Drosophila small subunits27. We suggest that this region forms a  flexible and disordered loop between the two B-strands.
The non-conserved 17 residue loop between TOA2 β-strands S4 and S5 is not observed, and it is shortened to a three residue turn in TFIIAγ.
The disordered residues cluster into several regions; the N and C termini (residues 1–7 and 294–295) and regions labelled I, II and III in Figure 1 corresponding to residues 64–77, 91–93 and 216–261, respectively.
n interesting feature of this structure is the loop region connecting helix α3 and strand β7. This loop is positioned close to the active site, but extends away from the core of the enzyme to interact with the active site region of another monomer of SULT1A3, related by crystallographic symmetry (Figure 3).
The disordered residues cluster into several regions; the N and C termini (residues 1–7 and 294–295) and regions labelled I, II and III in Figure 1 corresponding to residues 64–77, 91–93 and 216–261, respectively.
Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated R8 had similar CD spectra in the aqueous buffers (Fig. A), suggesting that phosphorylation did not induce a large structural change in R8.
The data show that R8 (residues 708–831 of CFTR) is functional; it stimulated CFTR-ΔR/S660A channel activity. Surprisingly, R8 is predominantly unstructured, exhibiting a CD spectrum characteristic of random coil, both when phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated.
NMR 1H-15N correlation spectra for the nonphosphorylated R region and the highly phosphorylated R region (superimposed in Fig. 1b) show sharp peaks, with dispersion for backbone amide proton resonances limited to values between approximately 8 and 8.7 p.p.m. in the proton dimension. This limited dispersion is diagnostic of disorder (in contrast to a dispersion of ~7 to 10 p.p.m. for folded proteins) and reflects the rapid interconversion between heterogeneous conformations in disordered proteins, in which all nuclei experience similar average chemical environments
The R region is disordered independent of phosphorylation.
The tryptic patterns of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated R8 (Fig. A) show that most of the protein is susceptible to trypsin.
The final electron density map allows a tracing of the α-subunit from residues 5 to 89 and the β-subunit from 2 to 111. The residue β111 is open to a large 50 A diameter solvent channel and it is assumed that the remaining 34 C-terminal residues adopt a random conformation and are therefore not visible in the map.
The IDR characterized in the publication and spanning the C-terminal residues corresponds to region 132-165 of the amino acid sequence, since the natural precursor form of the protein contains a signal peptide (1-20) that is cleaved in the mature secreted protein.
The carboxy-terminal peptide of the beta-subunit, which is rich in O-linked sugars, is disordered.
The carboxyl terminus of the β-subunit projects into a solvent expanse and there is no defined electron density for the last 34 residues.
In this model, part of the β-subunit (112B–145B) is not visible in the electron density map, as is the case with most of the N-linked sugar residues.
The IDR characterized in the publication and spanning the C-terminal residues corresponds to region 133-165 of the amino acid sequence, since the natural precursor form of the protein contains a signal peptide (1-20) that is cleaved in the mature secreted protein.
The N52 and N78 from the α-subunit and N13 and N30 from the β-subunit are N-glycosylated, whereas S121, S127, S132, and S138 from the β-subunit are attached with O-glycans [31–33, 39].
All four previously-reported O-glycosylation sites, S121, S127, S132, and S138, are within this peptide sequence.
Only S127, S132, and S138 within this peptide sequence are known O-glycosylation sites, suggesting there is at least one novel O-glycosylation site present in this peptide.
The mentioned glycosylation sites correspond to Ser141, Ser147, Ser152, Ser158.
There is a deep minimum in this spectrum near 200 nm characteristic of a protein with a large proportion of random coil structure (29).
This result is in good agreement with the FTIR spectra. Thus both CD and FTIR support the conclusion that PKI contains a large proportion of random coil structure. The combined percentages of random coil and turn structures indicated by CD for this protein are unusually large.
In the amide I' region the PKI spectrum shows a single broad peak whose maximum occurs at 1645 cm-1, the characteristic frequency assigned to random coil structure, indicating that this might be the dominant secondary structure in the protein.
However, it is clear from the maximum in the spectrum at 1645 cm-1 that a significant portion of the structure of PKI is likely to be random coil in nature. One possible caveat to the interpretation of the FTIR data is that distorted helix structures have been observed to give rise to peaks as low as 1645 cm-1
This result is in good agreement with the FTIR spectra. Thus both CD and FTIR support the conclusion that PKI contains a large proportion of random coil structure. The combined percentages of random coil and turn structures indicated by CD for this protein are unusually large.
PKIα is an intrinsically disordered protein with transient secondary and short-lived tertiary interactions
Far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of PKIα acquired at 25°C in native condition showing the typical CD profile for IDPs, with a minimum around 208 nm
Altogether, the CD and NMR data reveal that in absence of a binding partner PKIα samples transient secondary structures encompassing the HAR and NES motifs with short-lived tertiary conformations.
PKIα is an intrinsically disordered protein with transient secondary and short-lived tertiary interactions
[1H,15N]-Heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum of PKIα free form with resonance assignment. The protein fingerprint features a poor resonance dispersion clustered around eight ppm in the 1H dimension, typical of intrinsically disordered proteins
Altogether, the CD and NMR data reveal that in absence of a binding partner PKIα samples transient secondary structures encompassing the HAR and NES motifs with short-lived tertiary conformations.
These profiles show the typical signatures of intrinsically disordered proteins, with the Kratky plot featuring a plateau at high q values as well as the absence of a bell-shaped curve (Figure 7C, bottom panel). In addition, the P(r) curve shows that PKIα adopts a highly extended conformational ensemble, with an abnormally large Dmax (~110 Å) and Rg (~30 Å) values for a protein of its size, both parameters are indicative of an extended, intrinsically disordered protein (Kikhney and Svergun, 2015; Figure 8D). In fact, the back-calculated SAXS profiles from the RAM-generated ensembles are in excellent agreement with the experimental SAXS scattering profiles (χ = 0.86 for q < 0.2) (Figure 7C). In the bound state, the HAR motif of PKIα is more ordered and adopts a more stable helical conformation; whereas the NES motif is considerably more dynamic and adopts a transient helical conformation (Figure 7E).

However, the HAR and PSS resonances display significant chemical shift changes (Figure 3A,B,E), suggesting that these regions of PKI undergo drastic structural rearrangements upon binding the kinase.

The PKA-C/PKIα complex relaxes through two structurally and kinetically distinct states to form the complex
To determine the mechanism of binding PKA-C and PKIα, we utilized stopped-flow rapid mixing fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and analyzed transient and total changes in donor fluorescence during the binding reaction.
From an initial analysis of the binding curve, we found that the total fluorescence of the Alexa-488 donor emission from the PKA-CDONOR/PKIACCEPTOR changed bi-exponentially through the course of the binding reactions (Figure 6A–D). The bi-exponential behavior suggests the presence of an initial fast binding step followed by a slow structural rearrangement (Table 1; Gianni et al., 2014).
Multi-pathway mechanism of PKIα binding to PKA-C revealed by stopped-flow FRET experiments.
The pre-exponential amplitudes for the fast phases increased hyperbolically, while the slow phase decreased hyperbolically (Figure 6D–H). Taken together, the behavior of the rate constants and the pre-exponential amplitudes for the fast and slow phases are consistent with a multi-pathway mechanism in which there is a fast binding phase of PKIα ensembles competent for binding and a subsequent structural rearrangement of these conformers upon binding (Dogan et al., 2014; Gianni et al., 2014).

The heat-stable inhibitor of the CAMP-dependent protein kinase is a small protein which binds to the catalytic subunit of the kinase and inhibits its activity (1, 2)
PKI was further purified by ion exchange and gel exclusion chromatography. Again, the purification was monitored by analysis of PKI activity (Fig. 2) and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3). Most of the PKI activity which could be recovered was found to elute in the 100-300 mM fraction on DEAE-chromatography, and gel electrophoresis suggested the presence of only minor contaminants at this stage of the purification. The minor contaminants were readily removed by chromatography on Sephadex G-50 yielding an apparently homogeneous preparation. The results of a typical purification are summarized in Table I. Starting from 6 liters of bacterial culture, a final preparation of 14 mg of purified PKI was obtained with an apparent overall yield of 9%. While analysis of activity suggests that only a 12.8-fold purification was necessary, this is probably an underestimate due to the presence of nonspecific inhibitory activity present in the crude extracts. The recovery was good for most steps, except for the Sephadex G-50 columns. Somewhat low recovery was encountered at this step because of the need to utilize only the peak fractions to avoid contamination with other small proteins. Characteristics of Bacterially Expressed PKI-The bacterially expressed PKI exhibited inhibitory potency identical to that of the native skeletal muscle protein. Both equally titrate the activity of pure CAMP-dependent protein kinase and exhibit identical specific activities (Fig. 4a). Henderson analysis (23) yielded K, values of 0.098 nM for the bacterial protein compared to 0.085 nM for the native protein; these values are identical within experimental error (Fig. 46)
The bacterially expressed PKI exhibited inhibitory potency identical to that of the native skeletal muscle protein. Both equally titrate the activity of pure CAMP-dependent protein kinase and exhibit identical specific activities (Fig. 4a)
The inhibitory activity of bacterially expressed PKI is indistinguishable from that of the native skeletal muscle protein (Fig. 4).

Further, no difference in the protease maps was observed in the absence or presence of urea (2.0 M and 4.0 M), as judged using SDS/PAGE and HPLC (data not shown), providing further evidence that p21-F lacks stable structured domains.
Detailed analysis of trypsin cleavage products using MALDI mass spectrometry (22) showed that p21-F is cleaved at all predicted trypsin sites (Fig.1B) and reveals that globular protease-resistant domains do not exist.
CD spectropolarimetry was used to investigate the secondary structure of the p21 NH2 terminus. CD spectra for p21-F, -A, and -B are very similar (Fig.3A) and indicate that (i) despite the clear demonstration of Cdk inhibitory activity, p21 and its fragments possess very little regular secondary structure, and (ii) the lack of secondary structure within the NH2-terminal fragments is not due to a requirement that COOH-terminal domains be present to promote a stable fold.
The CD data thus indicate that p21 does not exhibit the characteristic cooperative unfolding behavior expected of a globular protein but rather provide further evidence that the protein is highly flexible and disordered in the free solution state.
The 1H-15N correlation spectrum of p21-A (Fig.4A) reveals resonances that are clustered with in a narrow chemical shift range (total 1H chemical shift dispersion of backbone amides 0.80 ppm) and indicates that the chemical environment of each amide group, as reported by 1H and 15N chemical shifts, is influenced predominantly by the chemical nature of its own amino acid side chain and not by long-range effects due to secondary or tertiary structure. The spectrum lacks the chemical shift dispersion expected for a folded globular protein.
In sharp contrast to the disordered free state, however, the p21 NH2 terminus adopts an ordered stable conformation when bound to Cdk2, as shown directly by NMR spectroscopy. We have, thus, identified a striking disorder-order transition for p21 upon binding to one of its biological targets, Cdk2. This structural transition has profound implications in light of the ability of p21 to bind and inhibit a diverse family of cyclin-Cdk complexes, including cyclin A-Cdk2, cyclin E-Cdk2, and cyclin D-Cdk4.
The conformational state of p21-B, which is 18 amino acids shorter than p21-A but has similar biochemical activity (Fig.2), is dramatically changed upon addition of a stoichiometric amount of unlabeled Cdk2, as revealed by 1H-15N correlated spectra (Fig.5). Upon binding to Cdk2 (Fig.SB), there is a large increase in resonance dispersion (total 1H chemical shift dispersion of backbone amides ≈ 1.25 ppm).
Representative 15N line widths at half height for Cdk2-bound p21-B range from 9Hz to 16Hz, consistent with a monodisperse 44-kDa protein-protein complex.

The inhibitory activity of p21-F, -A, and -B toward Cdks was tested in vitro using cyclin A-Cdk2 purified from HeLa cells by immunoprecipitation and using histone H1 as the kinase substrate. The concentration producing 50% inhibition for all three p21 proteins is between 32 pM and 320 pM (Fig.2A). Cdk2 inhibitory activity was tested at 32 nM under the solution conditions used for structural studies (vide infra), including (i) high ionic strength, pH 7.0 (Fig.2A, B Left, and C Left), (ii) high ionic strength with sodium thiocyanate, pH 7.0 (Fig.2A, B Middle, and C Middle), and (iii) low ionic strength, pH 5.0 (Fig.2A, B Right, and C Right). Cdk2 kinase activity is diminished under conditions ii and iii compared with condition i (Fig.2B); significantly, however, p21-F, -A, and -B are potent Cdk2 inhibitors under all solution conditions (Fig.2C).

Surprisingly, we have found that p21 stimulates CDK8 kinase activity. p21 activation of CDK8, leading to transcriptional stimulation, stands in striking contrast to its inhibition of CDK2, the cell-cycle regulator primarily responsible for the ability of p21 to stop cell-cycle progression.
Thus, inactivation of Cdks by sustained expression of p21 may be the biochemical mechanism underlying the observed long-term cell cycle arrest.
Here, we present results that strongly suggest that this subunit mediates PCNA binding to DNA polymerase δ and corresponds to the subunit whose interaction with PCNA is targeted by p21Cip1.
We showed that RNF126 interacts with p21 and RNF126 overexpression increased p21
protein ubiquitination in an E3 ligase activity-dependent manner. 
When
Flag-RNF126 was immunoprecipitated by anti-Flag Ab, the
endogenous p21 protein could be detected in the protein
complex (Fig. 3A). In addition, the protein–protein interaction
between endogenous RNF126 and endogenous p21 was
detected in MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that
RNF126 and p21 proteins interact with each other under
physiologic conditions. 
RNF126 and p21 proteins interact with each other.
These ﬁndings suggest that RNF126 promotes cancer cell proliferation by targeting p21 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation.
To demonstrate p21Cip1 inhibition of the binding of the C-terminal domain of p66 to PCNA, the wells were coated with a streptavidin-biotinated p66 peptide complex by adding 50 μl of 20 μg/ml streptavidin plus 100 ng of biotinated p66 peptide in PBS to each well for 1 h.
Conversely, p66 interacts with the domain-interconnecting loop of PCNA, a region previously shown to be important for DNA polymerase delta activity and for binding of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 Cip1 . In accordance with this, a peptide containing the PCNA-binding domain of p21 Cip1 inhibited p66 binding to PCNA and the activity of native three-subunit DNA polymerase delta
In Fig. 4, we show that a peptide of 22 amino acids containing the PCNA-binding domain of p21 Cip1 inhibits both p66 peptide binding to PCNA and DNA synthesis by a mouse DNA polymerase delta fraction containing p66 (30) (Fig. 4B, inset).
Cell death was greatest in MT1A2 and A549 cells transduced with Ad vectors expressing p16, p18 and p27 (Figure 2 and Table 2), whereas p19 and p21 expression had a more cytostatic effect on cell proliferation. 
Additionally, we demonstrate that fibrillar collagen can also arrest cells at the G 2 phase, which is mediated in part by p21 CIP1
p21 CIP1 siRNA alone had a minimal effect on cell cycle distribution and did not significantly increase cell proliferation (data not shown), indicating that it is the cooperation between p15 INK4b and p21 CIP1 that is responsible for the cell cycle arrest observed when M24met cells are plated in the presence of FC. 
FC means fibrillar collagen

Data from GST pull-down experiments suggest that the C-terminal region (amino acids 152–158) of p21 mediates TRIM39-p21 association (Fig. 2C). 
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting confirmed that cyclin D1 and p21CIP1 were associated with CDK4 and CDK6 in complexes of this size (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material; also data not shown).
Mechanistically, TRIM39 interacts with p21, which subsequently prevents Cdt2 from binding to p21, therefore blocking ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of p21 mediated by CRL4(Cdt2) E3 ligase. 
To test if TRIM39 associates with endogenous p21 protein, we introduced TRIM39α-Myc or TRIM39β-Myc into HCT116 WT cells and then performed immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody. The association between p21 and TRIM39α or TRIM39β was readily detected (Fig. 2B)
In this study, we identiﬁed TRIM39 as a binding partner of p21 in the nucleus. Exogenous TRIM39 stabilized p21 by preventing its ubiquitylation, whereas TRIM39 depletion resulted in destabilization of p21, which was accompanied by increased ubiquitylation.
The CD spectrum of p57 lacks the features that are characteristic of helical or β-sheet secondary structure and instead exhibits a strong negative band at approximately 203 nm that is reminiscent of an unfolded protein [Fig. 3(A)].
The CD spectra at 5 and 80°C are characteristic of an unfolded protein.

The fluorescence emission spectrum exhibits a maximum at 350 nm [Fig. 3(B)], as expected for a solvent-exposed, unfolded protein.
The hydrodynamic radius of p57 determined with gel filtration is 32 Å (data not shown). A protein the size of p57 (316 amino acids) is expected to have hydrodynamic radii of 25 and 59 Å in globular and highly unfolded states, respectively.31 The hydrodynamic radius of p57 is approximately 1.3 times larger than expected for a monomeric, folded, globular protein, but significantly less than expected for a highly denatured protein.
 Intrinsic Disorder of the p57 CDK-Inhibition Domain
The CD spectrum of p57ID is reminiscent of an unfolded protein, with a negative minimum at 202 nm [Fig. 5(A)].

Intrinsic Disorder of the p57 CDK-Inhibition Domain
The HN chemical shifts of p57ID span 7.8–8.5 ppm (Fig. 6), which are within the ranges expected of unfolded proteins.
1H-15N HSQC spectrum of p57ID (17 μM p57ID, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 6.0, 30°C). Seventy resolved amide cross-peaks are observed from an expected total of 71 (76 residues minus Thr 1 and four Pro residues). The lack of HN chemical shift dispersion suggests that p57ID lacks stable secondary structure.
Similar to full-length p57, p57ID inhibits approximately 90% of the activity of cyclin A-CDK2 at a 1:1 molar ratio (Fig. 4), showing that the p57 CDK-inhibition domain is localized to the N-terminus, as expected from sequence comparisons with p21 and p27.
We call this segment the linker helix because it connects two domains, termed domain 1 and domain 2, that are conserved in the human CKIs (Fig. 1c).
We determined backbone 1HN, 13Cα and 15N chemical shifts for p27-KID (BioMagResBank entry 6112) and used secondary 13Cα chemical shift values (δΔ 13Cα)23 to identify those residues shown by CD to adopt helical secondary structure (Fig. 1a)24. Most residues show near random coil 13Cα chemical shift values (near zero δΔ 13Cα values). However, all residues between positions 37 and 59 show positive δΔ 13Cα values, consistent with α-helical secondary structure.
p27 is comprised of an N-terminal domain (p27-KID, residues 22–104) that binds and inhibits Cdk/cyclin complexes and a C-terminal domain (residues 105–198, p27-C) that contains several sites of post-translational modification, including T187 (Fig. 1a).
We probed the structure and dynamics of the p27 C-terminus using NMR spectroscopy, first by studying the isolated C-terminal domain (p27-C) and second by studying isotope-labeled p27 bound to Cdk2/cyclin A. The 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled p27-C (Fig. 1b, green) exhibited the limited chemical shift dispersion that is typical of intrinsically unstructured proteins (IUPs). Further, secondary 13Cα chemical shift values (Δδ 13Cα) (Supplementary Fig. 1a) did not indicate the existence of highly populated secondary structure and {1H}-15N heteronuclear (hetNOE) values (Supplementary Fig. 1b) were almost exclusively negative, consistent with frequent, random amide group fluctuations on the high ps-low ns time scale. In addition, the chemical shift values of most amides within p27-C were very similar for the isolated domain and this domain in the context of 2H/15N-p27 bound to Cdk2/cyclin A (Fig. 1b, red). The structural independence of p27-C was confirmed by showing that resonances for p27-KID bound to Cdk2/cyclin A (Fig. 1c, blue) were recapitulated in the 2D 1H-15N TROSY spectrum of 2H/15N-p27/Cdk2/cyclin A (Fig. 1c, red). Together, these results indicated that p27-C in the p27/Cdk2/cyclin A complex is an independent, flexible domain that lacks secondary structure.
While the N-terminal KID of free p27 contained regions of transient structure, the C-terminal domain (p27-C, residues 105–198) lacked detectable secondary structure.
Here we have shown that the C-terminal domain of p27 adopts a disordered and quite highly extended conformation when p27 is bound to Cdk2/cyclin A.
In contrast, the unbound p27 Cdk-inhibition domain is intrinsically disordered (natively unfolded) as shown by circular dichroism spectroscopy, lack of chemical-shift dispersion, and negative heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effects. The intrinsic disorder is not due to the excision of the Cdk-inhibition domain from p27, since circular dichroism spectra of the full-length protein are also indicative of a largely unfolded protein.
Intrinsic Structural Disorder of p27. The full-length p27 used here inhibits histone H1 phosphorylation by cyclin A-Cdk2 (Figure 2). The CD spectrum of full-length human p27 is characteristic of an unfolded protein (Figure 3). The minimum at 200 nm is indicative of an unfolded conformation, and the weak negative shoulder at 222 nm suggests the absence of significant amounts of helix or β-strand. The helix content is estimated at 2 or 6% from [θ]222 or CDPro, respectively. The results indicate that full-length p27, while active as a Cdk inhibitor, is largely unfolded.
The negative ellipticity at 200 nm and the lack of significant ellipticity at 216 nm and above are typical of the CD spectra of unfolded proteins.
Titration of RhoA into 13C/15N-labeled p27 resulted in 2D CoN spectra exhibiting extensive resonance broadening for a region in the N-terminus encompassing residues 55–95 (Fig. 2). The finding that this region of p27 mediates interactions with RhoA is consistent with our observations that p27-C does not detectably associate with RhoA (Supplemental Fig. 2).
Using NMR spectroscopy and GDP exchange assays, we have shown that a region in the N-terminal region of p27 mediates binding to RhoA and interferes with nucleotide exchange.
Electron density is only observable for p27 residues 51–91, which corresponds to the region that binds Cdk2.
Electron density is only observable for p27 residues 51–91, which corresponds to the region that binds Cdk2.
The NMR properties of p27ID at 30 °C are characteristic of an unfolded protein. 1H chemical-shift ranges were obtained from DQF COSY (pH 4.4) or TOCSY−HSQC (pH 7.0) spectra using gradients for solvent suppression. The Hα and HN chemical shifts at pH 4.4 span 3.9−4.6 and 7.8−8.6 ppm, respectively, and at pH 7.0 span 4.05−4.59 and 7.77−8.58 ppm, respectively (data not shown). These chemical-shift ranges are typical of those observed in unfolded proteins (28). The amide 1H−15N NOE is negative (approximately −1 to −3.9) for each of 64 resolved mainchain amide cross-peaks at pH 4.4 (from an expected total of 70; data not shown), indicating that the p27ID main chain is highly flexible with motion on a time scale characteristic of unfolded proteins (29, 30). 
NMR study of the inhibitory domain of p27 (p27ID), spanning residues 22-97.
The CD spectra of p27ID in kinase-assay buffer at 30 and 60 °C are also characteristic of an unfolded protein (Figure 5). The minimum at 204 nm is indicative of an unfolded conformation, and the weak negative shoulder at 222 nm suggests the absence of significant amounts of helix or β-strand. The CD spectrum of p27ID at 25 °C is independent of pH in the range 4 to 7.5 and concentration in the range 20 μM to 1 mM (data not shown). The spectroscopic data collectively indicate that the p27 Cdk-inhibition domain is intrinsically disordered in isolation under conditions where the domain is functional as a kinase inhibitor, in contrast to the ordered structure adopted upon binding cyclin A-Cdk2 (Figure 1A). 
p27ID inhibits histone H1 phosphorylation by cyclin A-Cdk2 (25 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5, 30 °C). Reactions contained 50 nM cyclin A-Cdk2 and 0 or 50 nM p27ID. The cyclin A-Cdk2 used here is over 90% active, as calibrated with staurosporine (16).
CD far-UV study of the inhibitory domain of p27 (p27ID), spanning residues 22-97.
The CD spectra of p27ID in kinase-assay buffer at 30 and 60 °C are also characteristic of an unfolded protein (Figure 5). The minimum at 204 nm is indicative of an unfolded conformation, and the weak negative shoulder at 222 nm suggests the absence of significant amounts of helix or β-strand. The CD spectrum of p27ID at 25 °C is independent of pH in the range 4 to 7.5 and concentration in the range 20 μM to 1 mM (data not shown). The spectroscopic data collectively indicate that the p27 Cdk-inhibition domain is intrinsically disordered in isolation Local Helix Formation in the p27 Cdk-Inhibition Domain. CD spectroscopy indicates that p27ID becomes partially helical at lower temperature (Figure 5). The lack of a folded baseline and differing estimates of [θ]222 for a fully formed helix hinder quantitative determinations of helical content in largely unfolded proteins such as p27ID. Using the method of Chen et al. (19) and CDPro (20), the helix content of p27ID at 5 °C is estimated to be 10 and 16%, respectively. Both estimates are less than the total α and 310 helix content of 33% observed in the crystal structure of the domain bound to cyclin A-Cdk2 (9). The temperature dependence of the CD signal at 222 nm indicates that the helix is only marginally stable (Figure 6). Thus, although intrinsically disordered at physiological temperature, p27ID exhibits an inherent propensity to adopt helical structure.
CD far-UV study of the inhibitory domain of p27 (p27ID), spanning residues 22-97.
p27ID binds cyclin A-Cdk2 with a Kd of 8 ± 2 nM at 30 °C (Figure 9). The L41P mutant, which contains approximately half of the helix in unbound p27ID, binds with essentially the same affinity (Kd = 9 ± 1 nM at 30 °C) as p27ID. The K47P and A55P mutants, in which helix formation is essentially abolished, bind with slightly lower affinities (16 ± 3 and 13 ± 2 nM, respectively, at 30 °C). At 15 °C, where the helix is more populated, the Kd values for p27ID and L41P are 8 ± 1 and 10 ± 2 nM, respectively (data not shown). Thus, some correlation exists between loss of α-helix in the unbound inhibitor and an increase in Kd. However, the differences are very small in free energy terms (ΔΔG = 0.1 to 0.4 ± 0.4 kcal mol-1) as compared to the free energy of binding (ΔG = −11.4 ± 0.3 kcal mol-1 for p27ID).
Helix Stabilization with Alanine Substitutions. The importance of preformed local helix formation can be addressed by stabilizing helices with multiple alanine substitutions (37).2 Three sites in the α-helix (Gln 40, Asp 44, and Lys 47) were substituted simultaneously with Ala. These residues do not make quaternary contacts with cyclin A-Cdk2 in the crystal structure (9), and AGADIR (38, 39) predicts a 50−100% increase in helix content for residues 38−52 of the α-helix upon their simultaneous substitution with Ala. CD spectroscopy indicates that helix content of the E40A/D44A/K47A mutant is increased as envisaged (Figures 6 and 7), with an estimated helix content at 5 °C of 17 or 22% from [θ]222 or CDPro, respectively. The expected value would be 29% if the α-helix (but not the 310 helix) was fully formed in the mutant (Figure 1B) (9). The Kd of the E40A/D44A/K47A mutant for cyclin A-Cdk2 is increased slightly to 12 ± 3 nM (ΔΔG = 0.4 ± 0.2 kcal mol-1 relative to p27ID; Figure 9).
We conclude that the unbound p27 Cdk-inhibition domain is largely unfolded with a detectable conformational bias toward the α-helix formed upon binding cyclin A-Cdk2. This conformational bias is not beneficial in thermodynamic or kinetic terms for productive folding and binding. Indeed, enhancement of the propensity to form the α-helix impedes kinase inhibition in kinetic terms.
The crystal structure of the human p27Kip1 kinase inhibitory domain bound to the phosphorylated cyclin A-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complex has been determined at 2.3 angstrom. p27Kip1 binds the complex as an extended structure interacting with both cyclin A and Cdk2. On cyclin A, it binds in a groove formed by conserved cyclin box residues. On Cdk2, it binds and rearranges the amino-terminal lobe and also inserts into the catalytic cleft, mimicking ATP.

Complexes of cyclins with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a central role in the control of the eukaryotic cell cycle. The discovery of proteins that bind to and inhibit the catalytic activity of cyclin-CDK complexes has identified kinase inhibition as an intrinsic component of cell-cycle control (reviewed in refs 1-3). These inhibitors (CKIs) induce cell-cycle arrest in response to anti-proliferative signals, including contact inhibition and serum deprivation, TGFβ (ref. 5), myogenic, myeloid and neuronal differentiation, and DNA-damage checkpoints. The inhibitors, which are present in proliferating cells as well, may also help to coordinate cell-cycle progression by their redistribution between different cyclin-CDK complexes.
The inhibitory domain of p27 binds the cyclin A-Cdk2 complex as an extended structure interacting with both subunits. Key hydrophobic and hydrogen-bond interactions between a 10-amino-acid region of p27, which contains the conserved LFG sequence motif, and a  shallow groove of cyclin A, which consists of conserved cyclin-box residues, are likely to serve as an anchor point in initial binding, facilitating subsequent interactions with Cdk2. p27 bind-ing inhibits the CDK catalytic activity because its interactions with the N-terminal β-sheet of Cdk2 induce conformational changes that change the shape of the catalytic cleft and because p27 inserts into and fills up the catalytic cleft, eliminating any potential for ATP binding.
The crystal structure of the human p27Kip1 kinase inhibitory domain bound to the phosphorylated cyclin A-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) complex has been determined at 2.3 angstrom. p27Kip1 binds the complex as an extended structure interacting with both cyclin A and Cdk2. On cyclin A, it binds in a groove formed by conserved cyclin box residues. On Cdk2, it binds and rearranges the amino-terminal lobe and also inserts into the catalytic cleft, mimicking ATP.
Complexes of cyclins with cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a central role in the control of the eukaryotic cell cycle. The discovery of proteins that bind to and inhibit the catalytic activity of cyclin-CDK complexes has identified kinase inhibition as an intrinsic component of cell-cycle control (reviewed in refs 1-3). These inhibitors (CKIs) induce cell-cycle arrest in response to anti-proliferative signals, including contact inhibition and serum deprivation, TGFβ (ref. 5), myogenic, myeloid and neuronal differentiation, and DNA-damage checkpoints. The inhibitors, which are present in proliferating cells as well, may also help to coordinate cell-cycle progression by their redistribution between different cyclin-CDK complexes.

We obtained crystals of the ternary Skp1-Skp2-Cks1 complex by using a truncated human Cks1 (residues 5–73) and the previously described truncated Skp1-Skp2 complex (Schulman et al., 2000) (Figures 1A and 1B). For the crystallization of the quaternary Skp1-Skp2-Cks1-p27Kip1 complex, we used a 24 residue p27Kip1 phosphopeptide (residues 175–197; Figure 1C) that we show binds to Skp1-Skp2-Cks1 with an affinity essentially identical to that of full-length phosphorylated p27Kip1 (Table 1). This peptide is from the p27Kip1 C-terminal domain (CTD) that is distinct from the N-terminal domain (residues 22–106; NTD) that inhibits the Cdk2-cyclin A/E complexes (Russo et al., 1996).
In the structure of the quaternary Skp1-Skp2-Cks1-p27Kip1 complex, a ten amino acid segment of the p27Kip1 peptide (residues 181–190) adopts a partially extended conformation and spans the Skp2 LRR domain and Cks1 (Figure 2). The remaining 14 residues of the p27Kip1 peptide do not have interpretable electron density, and we presume they are disordered (Figure S1 available in the Supplemental Data with this article online). The N-terminal portion of the p27Kip1 segment packs with Skp2, a central Glu185 side chain inserts in between Skp2 and Cks1, and the C-terminal portion containing the phosphorylated Thr187 (pThr187) binds to Cks1. p27Kip1 binding does not cause any conformational changes in either Cks1 or Skp2.
The ten amino acid p27Kip1 segment binds to Skp2-Cks1 in a bipartite manner. Residues 181–184 bind to Skp2, residue 185 binds to both Skp2 and Cks1, and residues 186–190 bind to Cks1 (Figures 3C and 3D). The vast majority of the intermolecular contacts are centered on the Glu185 and pThr187 side chains of p27Kip1.

The ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of the Cdk2 inhibitor p27(Kip1) plays a central role in cell cycle progression, and enhanced degradation of p27(Kip1) is associated with many common cancers. Proteolysis of p27(Kip1) is triggered by Thr187 phosphorylation, which leads to the binding of the SCF(Skp2) (Skp1-Cul1-Rbx1-Skp2) ubiquitin ligase complex. Unlike other known SCF substrates, p27(Kip1) ubiquitination also requires the accessory protein Cks1.
The phosphorylated Thr187 side chain of p27Kip1 is recognized by a Cks1 phosphate binding site, whereas the side chain of an invariant Glu185 inserts into the interface between Skp2 and Cks1, interacting with both. The structure and biochemical data support the proposed model that Cdk2-cyclin A contributes to the recruitment of p27Kip1 to the SCFSkp2-Cks1 complex.

The initial observation that the C-terminus of p27 is sufficient to co-immunoprecipitate with RhoA was made with a construct that was slightly longer than our p27-C construct [16]; however, extension of our construct to residue 88 (p2788–198) did not restore the migratory phenotype. For completeness, we also tested the complementary N-terminal construct, p271–87, which also did not exhibit a migratory phenotype. In summary, promotion of RhoA-dependent cell migration by p27 requires both the previously identified C-terminal region as well as the N-terminal region of p27 identified here.
To further understand structure-function relationships for p27, we studied p27-FL and p27-KID using solution NMR spectroscopy. Comparison of 2D 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra for the two polypeptides (Supplementary Fig. 1a,c online) corroborates findings based on CD spectra. The subspectrum in Supplementary Figure 1b online, showing only resonances that appear at the same chemical shift values in Supplementary Figure 1a,c online, shows ∼80% of the resonances observed for p27-KID (Supplementary Fig. 1c online). This illustrates that the conformation of most residues in p27-KID is virtually equivalent in the truncated and full-length molecules. Moreover, spectra for both molecules show limited resonance dispersion (backbone amide protons resonate between 7.8 and 8.5 p.p.m.), a feature typical of intrinsically disordered, biologically active polypeptides

Domain 1, though highly dynamic in solution, is relatively compact (ten residues), and therefore folding to a single conformation on binding cyclin A is associated with a relatively small entropy penalty. In contrast, domain 2 spans 29 residues that fold on binding to Cdk2, and, correspondingly, this reaction is associated with a large entropy penalty. Notably, domains 1 and 2 bind their respective targets with similar affinity, clearly revealing the thermodynamic importance of each of these interactions.
Our data show that interactions mediated by the two conserved domains of p27-KID contribute considerably to the overall ΔG value.

A putative nuclear export sequence (NES) in p27 is identified. Mutation of this NES reduced nuclear export, impaired p27-CRM1 interactions, and increased p27 stability.
p27 Contains an Atypical NES
We identified a putative NES within the Cdk-binding domain of p27 between amino acids 32 and 45 (Figure ​(Figure6A)6A) based on the homology of leucine spacing to a cryptic NES identified in the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) Rev protein (Mancuso et al., 1998 blue right-pointing triangle). The spacing of the three leucines in this region of p27 is highly conserved between species.
To obtain additional evidence that amino acids 32 through 45 in p27 comprise a functional NES, we tested its ability to mediate nuclear export of an unrelated protein. For this, peptides containing the putative p27 NES (CRNLFGPVDHEELTRDLE) were coupled to FITC-labeled BSA and were microinjected into nuclei of adherent HeLa cells. As is shown in Figure ​Figure6B,6B, a significant fraction of p27NES-FITC-BSA translocated into the cytoplasm within 45 min. In contrast, the nuclear localization of FITC-BSA remained unchanged. Although p27-NES mediated export of p27NES-FITC-BSA is not very efficient, possibly due to competing events such as the observed accumulation in nuclear speckles, or due to rate-limiting binding partners, these findings support the interpretation that amino acids 32 through 45 in p27 function as an NES.
p27NES Shows Delayed Cytoplasmic Accumulation after Proteasome Inhibition
Mutation of S10 But Not of T187 Affects Nuclear Export of p27
Mutation of S10 to alanine strongly inhibited p27 export (Figure ​(Figure6,6, B and C), suggesting that phosphorylation at this site is essential for nuclear export of p27.
Phosphorylation at serine 10, a major phosphorylation site of p27(Kip1), increases its protein stability
Substitution of Ser(10) with Ala (S10A) markedly reduced the extent of p27(Kip1) phosphorylation and prevented the shift in electrophoretic mobility. Phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that phosphorylation at Ser(10) accounted for approximately 70% of the total phosphorylation of p27(Kip1), and the extent of phosphorylation at this site was approximately 25- and 75-fold greater than that at Ser(178) and Thr(187), respectively.
Furthermore, a mutant p27(Kip1) in which Ser(10) was replaced with glutamic acid in order to mimic the effect of Ser(10) phosphorylation exhibited a marked increase in stability both in vivo and in vitro compared with the wild-type or S10A mutant proteins. These results suggest that Ser(10) is the major site of phosphorylation of p27(Kip1) and that phosphorylation at this site, like that at Thr(187), contributes to regulation of p27(Kip1) stability.
Delayed Nuclear Export Is Associated with Increased p27 Protein Stability
The solution structure of Rap1 BRCT domain contains three β-strands and three α-helices. Three helices, α1 (residue 31–39), α2 (residue 75–81) and α3 (residue 87–90), face the β-sheet that is formed by strand 1 (residue 16–18), strand 2 (residue 47–48) and strand 3 (residue 59–60).
The proportion of the secondary structure elements in Rap1 BRCT domain is relatively low and there are several long flexible loops among secondary structure elements. Therefore, the global conformation of Rap1 BRCT domain is rather flexible. No resonance signal maintained in 2-D 1H–2H exchange experiment also indicated a loose structure of Rap1 BRCT domain.
The resulting electron density map was interpretable for the DNA and the protein, with the exception of residues at the termini (residues 353–359 and 595–598), three internal regions (residues 482–512, 565–571, and 579–585), and one of the overhanging bases of the binding site.

However, the α-carbon chain cannot be traced beyond residue 284 because the electron density is so diffuse.
Interestingly, the electron density for the C terminus, which is rich in alanine, glycine, proline and other hydrophobic residues, is ill defined beyond the end of αH at position 285. 
These structures provide a complete picture of the NADP+-enzyme interactions involving the flexible 191–199 loop (well ordered in the H221L mutant) and suggest that the hydrophobic residues Phe192-Met193 could facilitate hydride transfer.
In the H221L-NAD1 complex, where a sulfate ion replaces the 2'-phosphate, the electron density corresponding to the 191–199 loop is less well defined even though the NAD1 site appears to be fully occupied. This implies that although the sulfate ion establishes a series of interactions with both the protein and the cofactor, these are less efficient in stabilizing the 191–199 loop than those formed by the covalently bound 2'-phosphate.
 This loop, which becomes well ordered only in the enzyme-
NADP+-folate complex, has been found to shield the nicotinamide moiety from solvent and to participate on the transition state stabilization (44).
The 191–199 loop, located between the bF sheet and the aG helix, seems to be predominantly stabilized by its interactions with the dinucleotide, particularly by the salt bridge between Lys195 and the 2'-phosphate.

When exposed to an acidic environment, E7(1-40) undergoes a structural transition triggered by the
neutralization of its acidic residues, similar to the full-length HPV16 E7 dimer (7). A decrease in the CD signal at 220 nm at low pH is indicative of the acquisition of R-helix. Moreover, as pH decreases, the CD indicates that the PII content tends to disappear.
The N-terminus could thus be responsible for E7's conformational behavior toward pH; it undergoes a conformational transition within a physiological pH range that could correspond to an induction in α-helix and/or loss of PII structure. The difference spectrum between E7(1−40) at pH 7.5 and pH 3.0 displays the positive distinctive band at 218 nm present in PII models (Figure 2b inset).
This result is in excellent agreement with the observed conformational transition by CD, where the molar ellipticity at 220 nm decreased when the pH is lowered (not shown).
The far-UV CD spectrum of the E7 dimer (E72) at pH 7.5 is dominated by a minimum at 205 nm, with a negative band at around 220 nm (Figure 2a, dotted line). The band at 220 nm is indicative of α-helix content, and the minimum at 205 can be the result of a combination of an α-helix (208 nm) and disordered structure (200 nm). When observing the spectrum of the N-terminus of E7, it is reminiscent of that of a disordered polypeptide with a minimum around 200 nm (Figure 2a, full line). To analyze the structural contribution of the E7(1−40) domain to the E72 far-UV−CD, the subtraction of spectra was carried out and presents only the α-helix spectral characteristics, suggesting that the apparently disordered components in the E7 dimer, manifested by the minimum at 205 nm, are introduced by the N-terminal module (Figure 2a, inset), in agreement with the solved structure of HPV 1A E7 where the N-terminal region is absent in the crystal ( 5) and HPV 45 E7 N-terminus not analyzable by NMR ( 4).
At pH 7.5, E7(1−40) elutes at 15 mL, while CI2(1−40) does so at 17 mL, indicating that at neutral pH, E7(1−40) is extended (Figure 3). E7(1−40) elutes with the hydrodynamic volume of a globular protein of 25 kDa, equivalent to a Stokes radius of 20.9 Å, a value even larger than the predicted for a “natively unfolded” polypeptide of this size.
In addition, we carried out pulse field gradient NMR experiments at 1 mM E7(1−40), and from the diffusion coefficient the domain was shown to be monomeric, with a calculated stokes radius of 21.26 Å, expected for an extended fragment of that number of residues (not shown).

When the same experiment is carried out at pH 4.0, the hydrodynamic volume of CI2(1−40) stays unmodified, but E7(1−40) elutes at a larger volume from the column, strongly suggesting that the conformational change induced at low pH yields a more compact structure (Figure 3).
Comparison of the far-UV CD spectra of the E7N sub-fragments in 10 mM Tris.Cl buffer at pH 7.5 showed a lack of canonical secondary structure with a general appearance of disorder (Figure 2A). Most sub-fragments presented similar spectra, with molar ellipticity values around −15,000 deg·cm2·dmol−1 resembling those of the previously described E7 (1–40) domain [27].
They assessed the regions: 1-40, 1-20, 16-40, 16-31, 21-29 and 25-40. For all of them they found typical spectra of unstructured proteins.
Both RH values obtained for E7N were significantly larger than the RH value expected for a 40 residue globular protein (13.8 Å) [51], confirming the IDP nature of E7N. However, both values were also smaller than the RH value predicted for a fully unfolded polymer (18.1 Å) [51], which suggested some degree of compaction of the domain that may be due to the presence of transient long-range interactions. PFG-NMR experiments showed a further decrease in the RH value at pH 5.0 (14.3±0.3 Å, Table 3), suggesting that protonation of the acidic residues contributed to E7N compaction.
 A first inspection of the one dimensional 1H spectrum of E7N in aqueous solution at pH 5.0 showed poorly dispersed amide proton resonances (data not shown), with most peaks within the 7.8–8.5 ppm range, making assignment a rather challenging task. The methyl proton region also showed poor dispersion of peaks, confirming the expected disordered nature of E7N.
All the NMR data determined for the E7N region indicate that it is highly flexible and highly disordered, as is also immediately evident from the SSP values as well as from negative 1H–15N heteronuclear NOE. Detailed inspection of these data also indicates short fragments of amino acids characterized by a mild secondary structural propensity, starting at residue 26 onwards (Figure 4).
Crystal structures of the p107 pocket domain in complex with LIN5212–34;phosS28 and E721–29. (Insets, left) The LIN52 and E7 peptides both bind at the LxCxE cleft. (Inset, top) The LIN52 association is mediated by the S28 phosphate, which contacts a p107/p130-specific binding pocket.
The E7 peptide binds to the LxCxE cleft in the B-box of p107 as previously observed in the Rb–E7 complex structure (Fig. 2; Supplemental Fig. 2B; Lee et al. 1998).

The E7 peptide binds to the LxCxE cleft in the B-box of p107 as previously observed in the Rb–E7 complex structure (Fig. 2; Supplemental Fig. 2B; Lee et al. 1998).
We then quantified the E7 peptide inhibition (Ki = 170 ± 50 nM) by displacing labeled LIN5212–34;phosS28 peptide in the FP assay (Fig. 1F). E721–29 contains an LxCxExL motif and inhibits LIN52 from interacting with p130, indicating that E7 disrupts DREAM by competitive inhibition at the LxCxE cleft of p130.
This implies that there is one binding site for the E7(1-40) peptide per RbAB monomer and that the stoichiometry of the E7(1-40)–RbAB interaction is 1 : 1.
The CR1 region does not appear to contribute to RbAB binding within the context of an E7N monomer, as shown by the fact that the E7(16-40) and E7(1-40) peptides have the same affinity for the RbAB domain (Table 1).
Therefore, our data show that the LxCxE motif contributes about 90% of the total binding energy for the HPV16 E7–RbAB interaction, providing quantitative support to previous results [[47]].
We tested the E7 CR2 region for PII content by measuring the far-UV CD spectra of the E7(16-40) and the E7(16-40)PP peptides at 5 °C. Both peptides presented a CD spectrum characteristic for a disordered polypeptide with a positive band at 218 nm, which is characteristic of the PII conformation (Fig. 5A).
Overall, our data indicate that both peptides from the HPV16 E7 CR2 region present residual PII structure in equilibrium with disordered conformations.
Far-UV CD analyses showed that HPV16 E7(1-40) displayed an extended PII structure, which was stabilized by phosphorylation of serine residues S31 and S32 [[23]].

Overall, our data indicate that both peptides from the HPV16 E7 CR2 region present residual PII structure in equilibrium with disordered conformations.
In addition, we carried out pulse field gradient NMR experiments at 1 mM E7(1−40), and from the diffusion coefficient the domain was shown to be monomeric, with a calculated stokes radius of 21.26 Å, expected for an extended fragment of that number of residues (not shown). When the same experiment is carried out at pH 4.0, the hydrodynamic volume of CI2(1-40) stays unmodified, but E7(1-40) elutes at a larger volume from the column, strongly suggesting that the conformational change induced at low pH yields a more compact structure (Figure 3).
At pH 4.0 and below, the negatively charged residues are neutralized, the charge repulsion decreases, and more R-helix is formed.
The difference spectrum between E7(1-40) at pH 7.5 and pH 3.0 displays the positive distinctive band at 218 nm present in PII models (Figure 2b inset).
This result is in excellent agreement with the observed conformational transition by CD, where the molar ellipticity at 220 nm decreased when the pH is lowered (not
shown).
Using a variety of spectroscopic and biochemical tools, we find that despite its nanomolar affinity, the HPV16 E7 complex with TAZ2 is disordered and highly dynamic. The disordered domain of HPV16 E7 protein does not adopt a single conformation on the surface of TAZ2 but engages promiscuously with its target through multiple interactions involving two conserved motifs, termed CR1 and CR2, that occupy an extensive binding surface on TAZ2.
It is clear from all of the results shown in Figures 2, 3, 6, and 9 that no single E7 structure will be able to satisfy all of the NOE constraints.

1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled ppE7(1−51) titrated with unlabeled TAZ2 show stepwise chemical shift perturbations as a function of increasing molar amounts of TAZ2 (Figure 2A), an indication that the complex and its components are in fast exchange on the NMR chemical shift timescale.
The anisotropy change was fitted to competition models,55 which provided affinity estimates for the individual competing peptides (Figure 5). The results clearly demonstrate that cooperativity between the CR1 and CR2 binding motifs enhances E7 affinity toward TAZ2.
Only when CR1 and CR2 are both present in the peptide is E7 able to reach its characteristic nM binding affinity (KD 22 nM,37 compared to 100 nM under the current conditions).
he far-UV CD spectra of rFNBD-A, rFNBD-B, rFNBD-D, and rFNBD-P were very similar and were dominated by a large minimum at ∼200 nm (Fig. 2). This type of spectra is characteristic of proteins that are predominately composed of random coil and γ-turns and contain a minimum amount of α-helix or β-sheet conformation(15., 16.).
Because of the defined, stable, secondary and tertiary structure in N29, the minute change in the intrinsic Trp fluorescence in N29 on binding of rFNBD-A, and the apparent lack of stable ordered conformation in the rFNBD proteins, the large conformational shift seen in the far-UV CD on recombinant adhesin binding to N29 is largely attributed to the rFNBD proteins assuming a predominately β-sheet structure on binding to N29.
N29 peptide corresponds to the NH2-terminal domain of the human fibronectin.

In the spectra of D1−D4 there is a large amount of resonance overlap, the limited 1H chemical shift dispersion reflecting the unfolded nature of the protein; this severely hampered the sequential assignment process.
The unfolded nature of D1-D4 gives rise to very high resolution spectra enabling accurate measurement of NMR parameters. The residue-specific NMR data for D1-D4, including chemical shifts, coupling constants and NOEs, reflect the absence of secondary structure and the predominantly unfolded nature of this protein.
By monitoring the elution volume (Ve) of rFNBD-B using gel-permeation chromatography as the concentration of GdnHCl was increased from 0 to 6 M, it was determined that rFNBD-B does not follow a cooperative unfolding model (Fig. 3).
It was determined that ANS did not bind to rFNBD-A or rFNBD-B under any conditions tested, indicating that the proteins do not appear to be capable of forming localized, stable regions of hydrophobic side chains (data not shown).
It was found that both termini of flagellin are rapidly degraded in the early steps of proteolysis.
This suggests that there are no significant intrinsic structural constraints in the terminal parts to limit the accessibility of the peptide bonds, i.e. these regions have an exceptionally flexible conformation. The readily hydrolysed terminal portions probably do not have any compact tertiary structure and are in extensive contact with the surrounding media. In contrast, the central region of the molecule, which involves the F40 and F27 fragments is quite stable against proteolysis, indicating that it is probably composed of compact structural units.

The interaction between the flagellum specific sigma factor, sigma 28, and its inhibitor, FlgM, was examined using multidimensional heteronuclear NMR. Here we observe that free FlgM is mostly unfolded, but about 50% of the residues become structured when bound to sigma 28. Our analysis suggests that the sigma 28 binding domain of FlgM is contained within the last 57 amino acids of the protein while the first 40 amino acids are unstructured in both the free and bound states.

The NH-NOE values for 38 of the first 45 N-terminal residues are shown to the left of the ordinate axis. NH-NOEs for the majority of these residues are large and nega-tive ( < -1.0) indicating the region is very flexible.
The flexibility present in the C-terminal half of FlgM is best indicated by periodic breaks in the positive NH-NOE values. Flexibility in this region is also suggested by the smaller than expected positive NH-NOE values.
The NMR resonances for the N-terminal 40 amino acids of FlgM show no significant chemical shift or line shape changes in the presence of cr28. This demonstrates that the N-terminal 40 amino acid residues are disordered whether or not FlgM is bound to cr28.
The electron density map did not produce the entire structure of the 4E-BP1 fragment, but the Pro47–Pro66 peptide moiety was determined.
...the present X-ray analysis showed that little structural change of the eIF4E cap-binding pocket is caused by the binding of the 4E-BP1 peptide in the solid state.
After BP1 limited cleavage by the proteases (thermolysin or trypsin) the significant decrease in ellipticity at 222 nm over time occurs [34].
Using this shorter construct in the presence of the human 4E-BP1 peptide, we obtained diffraction quality crystals and determined the co-crystal structures of Ascaris eIF4E-3 with m 2,2,7 GTP and m 7 GTP ( Table 3 ).
Using this shorter construct in the presence of the human 4E-BP1 peptide, we obtained diffraction quality crystals and determined the co-crystal structures of Ascaris eIF4E-3 with m 2,2,7 GTP and m 7 GTP ( Table 3 ).
Titration of 15N-labeled eIF4E with this peptide produced some, but not all, of the same chemical shift changes as the whole 4E-BP1 (Figure 3C).
Thus, residues 49-68 of 4E-BP1 are sufficient for eIF4E binding and translation inhibition.
The CD spectrum of 4E-BP1 is typical of an unfolded protein, although a very shallow minimum at 220-230 nm suggests a minimal amount of helical secondary structure (Figure 2B).
BP1 protein has a distinctive far-UV CD spectrum typical for a protein in the pre-molten globule state (Fig. 1, curve 2) with a characteristic deep minimum in the vicinity of 200 nm and relatively low ellipticity around 220 nm.
We also determined the crystal structure of 4EHP bound to a peptide comprising the 4E-BP1 canonical motif and noncanonical sequences (C+L+NC) and the corresponding peptide in GYF2 at 1.9 Å and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively (Fig. 2F–H; Table 1; Supplemental Fig. S4C,D).
The 4E-BP1 and GYF1/2 canonical motifs adopt a helical conformation on the dorsal surface of 4EHP, whereas the noncanonical sequences bind to the lateral surface of 4EHP using a binding mode similar to that described for 4E-BP1 in complex with eIF4E...
The crystal structures of human apo-eIF4E and cap-free eIF4E–4EBP1 peptide complex were solved at a resolution of 2.1 Å (Table 1).
Seemingly, binding of the 4EBP1 peptide does not appear to affect the cap binding pocket of eIF4E.
We concluded that the purified 4E-BPs have little or no folded structure in solution.
Thus, residues 49-68 of 4E-BP1 are sufficient for eIF4E binding and translation inhibition.
Finally, we determined the crystal structure of human (Hs) 4E-BP1 in complex with Hs eIF4E at 1.75 Å resolution (Figure 1D; Table 1), which demonstrated conservation of the key structural features observed in the Dm complexes.

In addition to the previously described α-helix including the 54YXXXXLΦ60 consensus motif (19) (BP α-I), 4E-BP1 contains a small 310 helical segment (BP α-II) and an extended hook-shaped loop (“C-terminal loop”).
Structure of eIF4E Bound to m7GTP and 4E-BP1.
The 4E-BP1 peptide binds to the opposite surface of the protein and forms interactions with schistosome eIF4E almost identical to those previously observed in the human eIF4E·4E-BP complex structure (56).

The structure of h4EHP(K45-F234) in complex with m7GTP and a peptide of 4E-BP1 was determined by molecular replacement using eIF4E as the search model.
The peptide is bound as an α-helix almost perpendicular to the α-helices on the convex side of the β-sheet.
Crystals were obtained for eIF4E complexed with m7GTP and a 4E-BP1 peptide (RIIYDRKFLMECRN).

The PDB shows this region lacks electron density, indicating it is disordered.
A large number of transcriptional activation domains (TADs) are intrinsically unstructured, meaning they are devoid of a three-dimensional structure. The fact that these TADs are transcriptionally active without forming a 3-D structure raises the question of what features in these domains enable them to function. One of two TADs in human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) is located at its N-terminus and is responsible for ∼70% of the transcriptional activity of hGR. This 58-residue intrinsically-disordered TAD, named tau1c in an earlier study, was shown to form three helices under trifluoroethanol, which might be important for its activity.
hGR tau1c was one of the IDPs that was studied in the early days before the PreSMo concept was introduced. Since many transcription factors and TADs contain PreSMos, we wanted to learn whether tau1c also contains PreSMos.
Fig. 1 shows a fingerprint region of an 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of hGR tau1c with resonance assignment. Based on the narrow chemical-shift dispersion in both 15N and 1H dimensions, we can confirm its overall unfolded/disordered nature in agreement with the bioinformatics prediction.
We carried out heteronuclear multi-dimensional NMR experiments on hGR tau1c in a more physiological aqueous buffer solution and found that it forms three helices that are ∼30% pre-populated.
Fig. 3d shows that hGR tau1c contains three helical PreSMos, the first (Helix 1) formed by residues 185-202, the second (Helix 2) by residues 206-225, and the third (Helix 3) by residues 232-244. All helices are ∼20-30% pre-populated.
The SSP scores of hGR tau1c clearly indicate that it is an MU type, and the combination of all NMR parameters show that it forms three helical PreSMos: the first helix (Helix 1) formed by residues 185-202, the second (Helix 2) by residues 206-225, and the third (Helix 3) by residues 232-244, respectively.

The model of amino acid residues 18−44 was built in (2Fo − Fc) maps. (Fo − Fc) maps did not give any significant electron density for amino acid residues 1−17, indicating that these residues were heavily disordered.
Authors are not considering the first Met residue, therefore the disordered region they are referring to is 1-18.
The crystal structure was refined by the standard refinement procedure in the X-PLOR protocol. A (2Fo−Fc) map computed after a refinement showed no significant electron density for the amino acid residues 1 to 40, indicating that these residues were heavily disordered.
Authors are not considering the first Met residue, therefore the disordered region they are referring to is 1-41.
By comparing the open structure to the closed structure, mechanisms for auto-inhibition and for the forced release of the product AdoHcy have been revealed in the GNMT structure. The N-terminal section of the adjacent subunit occupies the AdoMet binding site and thus inhibits the methyltransfer reaction, whereas the same N-terminal section forces the departure of the potentially potent inhibitor AdoHcy from the active site and thus facilitates the methyltransfer reaction. Consequently GNMT is less active at a low level of AdoMet concentration, and is only weakly inhibited by AdoHcy.
The binding of AdoMet to the active site of subunit B enhances the movement of the N-terminal domain (residues 1-40) of subunit B.
This Arg175 modification study indicates that the binding of AdoMet opens the entrance of the active site and acetate binds to Arg175. Indeed, in the AdoHcy-R175K structure, the active site entrance is opened widely by binding the AdoHcy.
Authors are not considering the first Met residue, therefore the disordered region they are referring to is 1-41.
Our model for the insertion domain is at present incomplete due to crystalline disorder, but it contains conserved residues likely to interact with the acceptor arm of tRNAGlY.
However, electron density between residues 85 and 170 is weak and it has been possible to build only 50 of the intervening 85 residues in one monomer and 45 in the other, in most cases with Ala side chains only.
Analogously to the PRLR-ICD, two overlapping subdomains were constructed; GHR-ICDmp (Ser270-Ser370) and GHR-ICDmd (Val361–Pro620; Figure 1B). Far-UV CD and NMR spectroscopic analyses confirmed that both subdomains were intrinsically disordered with a low content of secondary structure (Supplementary Figures S5A–S5D) and no significant longrange intramolecular interactions as assessed by cross-titrations (Supplementary Figure S5E).

We subsequently followed the same strategy as for the PRLR-ICD and chemical shift differences from 1 H-15N-HSQC spectra confirmed POPS specificity for GHRICDmp (Figures 3B and 3C). Pronounced chemical shift changes were observed in the membrane-proximal region of GHR-ICDmp upon POPC/POPS SUV binding (Lys287–Ser357) and signals from many of the N-terminal residues (Ser270–Lys287) disappeared, thereby identifying a LID1 comprising residues Ser270–Ser357 (Figure 3C). Again, to rule out artifacts from truncations, the lipid interaction was confirmed using full-length non-tagged GHRICD (GHR-ICDFL).
In contrast, the Gly-rich linker segment from residue G69-T87 as well as adjacent residues N67-E68 and K88-P90 are not visible in either molecule A or B (Figure 1a).
The Gly-rich linker connecting D1 to D2 is not visible in the electron density map (see above).
The IDR characterized in the publication corresponds to region 86-107 of the amino acid sequence, since the natural precursor form of the protein contains a signal peptide (1-18) that is cleaved in the mature secreted protein.

Unstructured region inside the DNA-binding domain of HSF from K. lactis. The region has been identified from Fig.4, where secondary structure deduced from the NOESY data is indicated below the NOE data. 
Yeast heat shock transcription factor N-terminal activation domains are unstructured as probed by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy.
The remaining peaks in Figure 2B, all negative in intensity, can be attributed to the N-terminal activation domain. These additional peaks have poor shift dispersion in the proton dimension, as is the case for unstructured proteins. Integrating the volumes of the signals in the spectra could account for approximately 183 of the possible 192 residues; however, only 103 peaks were sufficiently resolved to calculate NOES. These NOE values (Fig. 4) are sorted by proton chemical shift because there are no sequence-specific assignments currently available for this domain. Negative values indicate that all of the residues in this region exhibit a high degree of rapid internal motion, typical for an unstructured protein. 
Far-UV CD spectroscopy, performed at pH 7.0, also indicate that the N-terminal activation domains of yeast HSF are unstructured. Figure 5A shows CD spectra for the DNA-binding domain, and for the N-terminal activation domain plus the DNA-binding domain, as well as the difference between the two. The difference spectrum is characteristic of a random coil. We also examined the possibility that the N-terminal activation do- main might behave differently when the DNA-binding domain is bound to a DNA-binding site (Fig. 5B). An examination of this CD difference spectrum indicates that binding of the DNA- binding domain to the DNA does not induce any structural changes in the N-terminal activation domain. Identical results were obtained for the K. lactis constructs (not shown).
Yeast heat shock transcription factor N-terminal activation domains are unstructured as probed by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy.
Using the DNA-binding domain as a structural reference, we show that the protein backbone of the N-terminal activation domain undergoes rapid, large-amplitude motions and is therefore unstructured. Difference CD data also show that the N-terminal activation domain remains random-coil, even in the presence of DNA.
In addition, we used two-dimensional heteronuclear 15N{1H} NOE NMR and measurements of 15N relaxation parameters to show that the N-terminal activation domains from both yeast strains have a high degree of flexibility, which is consistent with an unstructured state in solution. The results are particularly compelling because they offer the first positive evidence for a dynamically disordered transcriptional activation domain.
In the absence of DNA, the NMR spectrum of HMG-1(2/3) is indicative of a random coil. Upon binding, the two DBDs that contact the DNA become ordered and adopt a well defined conformation in the minor groove.

The stoichiometry of binding was established by a series of titra-tion experiments using 15N/13C[Gly 11 ]-HMG-1(2/3) and 15N/13C-[Gly 37]-HMG-1(2/3) in which a single glycine in DBD2 and DBD3 respectively was isotopically labelled (Fig. 2a). HMG-1(2/3) binds to the PRDII dodecamer with DBD2 on the slow side of intermediate exchange; at ratios of DNA to protein less than 1:1, the cross-peak of Gly 11 in the 1H-15N correlation spectrum is broadened out (note this may also be due to non-specific interactions resulting in the formation of higher order structures since some precipitation is observed at ratios of DNA to protein below 1: 1 which completely dears up upon further addition of DNA); at a 1: 1 ratio the cross peak is located at the position of the bound form and does not shift upon further addition of DNA, although it does sharpen up slightly. 
The DNA in the DBD2 and DBD3 complexes is essentially B-type (Figs 4, 5).

In contrast, Gly 37 of DBD3 is in fast exchange and its cross peak in the 1H-15N correlation spectrum only begins to shift from its position in the free state at ratios of DNA to protein greater than about 0.8:1, reaching the position of the bound form at a ratio of2:l. Thus, under our experimental conditions, one molecule ofHMG-1(2/3) binds two molecules of the PRDII dodecamer, the equilibrium association constant for the interaction of DBD3 with the PRDII dodecamer is -1.0(±0.5)xl05 M-1, and the affinity of DBD2 for the PRDII dodecamer is about one to two orders of magnitude greater than that ofDBD3.
The DNA in the DBD2 and DBD3 complexes is essentially B-type (Figs 4, 5).

DNA-binding motifs DBD3 of HMGA1
Bending of the DNA is probably due to the presence of the AT-hook, which distorts the minor groove.
Circular dichroism spectrum of the HMGA1a (a.k.a. HMG-I) protein is essentially unstructured while free in solution.
A threonine residue at the beginning of each DNA-binding domain of HMG-I (residue numbers 21, 53, and 78) is conserved among mammalian species and proposed to help stabilize the A.T-hook DNA-binding motif. Phosphorylation of threonines number 53 and 78 of human HMG-I(Y) both in vivo and in vitro leads to a 20 fold reduction in the proteins DNA binding affinity.
Replacement of these threonines did not affect the equilibrium binding of these proteins to DNA as compared with wild-type HMG-I and HMG-Y. Molecular modelling of analogous peptides supported this finding. We conclude that these threonines are not directly important for A.T-hook DNA-binding and are conserved phosphorylation sites for down regulation of DNA binding by the A.T-hook motif in the HMG-I(Y) proteins.
Phosphorylated Thr53 and flanking regions.

Sequence analysis of the native peptide (90-107) after treatment, which specifically converts phosphoserine residues to S-ethylcysteine, revealed that 70-80% of serine residues 102 and 103 were phosphorylated in vivo. Both residues were fully phosphorylated in vitro by incubation with casein kinase II. 
High-resolution ETD analysis confirmed ADPr on S499, S507, and S519 in PARP-1, and it revealed five targets of S-ADPr as follows: HMGA1 (S8 and S9), HMGB1 (S181), HMGN1 (S7), NPM1 (S207), and TMA7 (S61) (Figures 3A–3C, S3A, and S3B).
ADP-ribosylation of Ser8 and Ser9 of HMGA1 depends on HPF1.
Reversible transitions between disordered and ordered configurations of the HMGA proteins, mediated by labile secondary biochemical modifications (Fig. 2), are likely to provide the necessary molecular underpinning for regulating the formation of functional HMGA complexes in cells and thereby controlling the biological activity of these proteins in vivo.
A derivative of HMG I lacking amino acids 91 to 108, the acidic C-terminal domain, was also capable of reconstituting integration activity (Fig. ​(Fig.3B,3B, lane 4). Derivatives containing amino acids 9 to 75 or 50 to 91, either A/T hooks 1 plus 2 or 2 plus 3, also reconstituted activity (Fig. ​(Fig.3B,3B, lanes 6, 8, and 9). The 50–91 protein displayed the highest specific activity for reconstitution, retaining activity at 0.2 μg per reaction.
We also demonstrated that the HIV-1 long terminal repeats (LTRs) contain multiple DNA binding sites for HMG I(Y). Tests in vitro revealed that binding of HMG I(Y) apposed LTR DNAs in a manner that promoted intermolecular ligation of dilute DNA solutions. As with assays of PIC reconstitution, these assays of DNA condensation required multiple DNA binding domains in each HMG I(Y) monomer. Taken together, these studies strengthen the idea that HMG I(Y) acts as an architectural cofactor for retroviral cDNA integration complexes and suggest a model for its role.

The binding of HMGA to AT-rich sites in PICs retroviral cDNAs leads to the formation of integrase-cDNA complexes.
Wild type HMG I, as well as 3 block alanine mutants (residues 21–26, 46–52, and 71–74) were found to bind p50 relatively well, although this interaction is abolished with the other alanine mutants (G59A, R60A, P61A4, K62A, and G63A) and GST as a control.
Third, analysis of 15 N relaxation data 12 for the 2:1 DNA to protein complex (Fig. 3a) delineated two distinct ordered domains comprising a longer DBD2 (residues 7- 22) and a shorter DBD3 (residues 33-41) separated by a highly flexible linker (residues 22- 32).
The flexible linker defined as 22-32 actually corresponds to region 70-80 in the UniProt numbering.
We identified the first two of the three AT hooks as main players mediating DNA/chromatin binding.
AT-hook motifs I and II of HMGA1a are main mediators of DNA binding in vivo
EMSAs with 7SK L2 RNA revealed that HMGA1a 3xΔA/T shows not only a decreased DNA-binding activity but also a significantly reduced ability to interact with 7SK L2 RNA (Figure 2C). Furthermore, EMSAs of 7SK L2 RNA with HMGA1 versions containing mutations of each single A/T-hook motif (HMGA1a ΔA/T1, HMGA1a ΔA/T2 and HMGA1a ΔA/T3) identify the first A/T-hook motif of HMGA1a as the site of interaction with 7SK RNA (Figure 2C, upper panel), since the same reduction in binding affinity is observed with the single HMGA1a ΔA/T1 mutant as with the triple mutant. 
HMGA1 co-purifies specifically with 7SK RNA
Importantly, albeit most genes are repressed in their expression by HMGA1, we also identified several genes that are positively regulated by HMGA1 and 7SK RNA (Figure 7A).
Figure 1C shows that the HMG I antibody coprecipitates CBP (lane 2) and that the CBP antibody coprecipitates HMG I (lane 4).
Specifically, CBP preferentially acetylates Lys-65 whereas P/CAF preferentially acetylates Lys-71.

Here we present the crystal structure of the complex of a DNA oligonucleotide with the third AT-hook (DBD3 in ref. 10) of the HMGA1 protein. 
The structure reveals a new architectural minor groove binding motif which stabilizes B-DNA, thereby facilitating the binding of other transcription factors in the opposing major groove. 
 Hence, it seems likely that the principal architectural role of HMG-1 probably involves reversing and preventing intrinsic distortions in DNA conformation, including bending or kinking, by binding in the minor groove, thereby facilitating specific recognition of the opposing major groove by other transcriptional factors such as NF-KB.
We further show that HMG-I and a novel related protein, HMG-R, also interact with other transcription factors. Using sense and antisense constructs of HMG-I/R in transient transfection assays with a retinoid responsive reporter, we also demonstrate that HMG-I/R is important for retinoid dependent transcriptional activity of RAR. These findings suggest a step wise mechanism by which RARs and other transcription factors can cause a targeted unfolding of compact chromatin as a first step in transcriptional activation, which would then be followed by recruitment of HAT activity and subsequent events.
Our data indicate that RARs and other transcription factors are capable of recruiting the H1 displacing activities of HMG-I/HMG-R in a targeted and ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 7). Since HMG-I protein has 19 putative acetylation sites (lysine residues), including two in the DNA binding AzT hook domain (Fig. 2B), the acetylation of HMG-I by CBP/p300 could potentially decrease its ability to displace H1. However, in accordance with its proposed role as a H1 displacement factor, either CBP or p300 (Fig. 5A) did not acetylate HMG-I 
In order to destabilize compact higher order chromatin structures and to liberate DNA from the nucleosome at the site of active transcription and facilitate RNA polymerase II complex assembly, both linker and chromosomal histones need to be released by transcription factors. Our model predicts that nuclear receptors and other transcription factors may recruit HMG-I/HMG-R and HATs in a targeted step wise manner, thereby unraveling linker and core histone assembly and facilitating the formation of transcriptionally competent DNA in the promoter regions of target genes.
We further show that HMG-I and HMG-R interact with RXR-α , PPAR-γ, c-Jun, and CBP, thus indicating recruitment of HMG-I/R by various transcription factors as a common mechanism for enhancer-dependent transcriptional activation. Finally, using transient transfections, we demonstrate that HMG-I/R is required for retinoid-dependent transactivation of a reporter construct by RAR, thus showing the functional consequences of RAR-HMG-I/R interactions. 
 In this report, we show that RARs interact in a ligand-dependent manner with HMG-I, which is known to displace histone H1 from chromatin.
 HMG-I and HMG-R interact with RARγΔAB in yeast. 
HMG-I and HMG-R proteins interacted specifically with RARγΔAB in the presence but not in the absence of the RAR-specific agonist, TTNPB (15) (Fig. 2A), demonstrating the ligand dependence of RAR/HMG interaction. TTNPB-induced RARγΔΔB interaction with both HMG-I and HMG-R was dose-dependent (data not shown).
HMG-R is a variant of HMG-I with a deletion of 67 nucleotids, being identical in the first 65 AA but differing thereafter. This protein is not listed on UniProt
To demonstrate that the full-length RARγ also interacts with HMG-I/HMG-R in a ligand-dependent manner in vivo, stably transformed RARγ (pAS2-RARγ) yeast cells were further transformed with pACT2-HMG-I/HMG-R and assayed for β-galactosidase activity in the  absence or presence of TTNPB. Full-length RARγ, by virtue of its intrinsic activation functions (2), elicited a low level of β-galactosidase activity in the presence of TTNPB, which was further induced approximately 25-fold in the presence of pACT2-HMG-I and pACT2-HMG-R (Fig. 3A). 
To determine the regions of RAR involved in interaction with HMG in vivo, pGBT-RARγ-DEF, pAS2-RARγΔAB, and pAS2-RARγ transformed yeast cells were used. pACT2-HMG-R interacted poorly with RARγDEF and RARγΔAB but interacted strongly with RARγ (Fig. 3D).
HMG-R is a variant of HMG-I with a deletion of 67 nucleotids, being identical in the first 65 AA but differing thereafter. This protein is not listed on UniProt
Full-length RARγ interacted with both HMG-I and HMG-R in a retinoid dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3E).
All the  resonances are sharp  and  are readily  assigned to equivalent  residues of a given type. It is  the spectrum typical of a disordered protein.
The line widths in 0 M NaCl are somewhat  greater than in 500 mM NaCl however and this demonstrates that the H6 does interact with   the DNA under these conditions  but that bound H6 is in rapid  equilibrium with  free solution  H6.
The specific peak broadening observed  suggest that it is largely the N-terminal half of H6 that is involved in inter- actions with DNA. Since the single threonine at position 7 is not markedly  affected,  the interacting segment probably extends from around residue 10 to around residue 35. 
Circular  dichroism  spectra of H6 obtained  under similar conditions support this conclusion : in the  absence of salt  the ellipticity at 222 nm is z -1000" and this   changes to - 2000° in 1 M NaCl at pH 7. On the basis of - 1000° for a random coil [21] and -30000° for a  full helical chain [22], -2000°   represents <4% helix or less than three  residues.
TonB-CTD is monomeric with an unstructured N terminus (103-151) and a well structured C terminus (152-239).
This extensive digestion is thought to be a consequence of disordered chain regions, whilst the sequence  22- 100 shows resistance to digestion as a  result  of  being in a  com- pact folded form, i.e. peptide GH5 is a close approxi- mation to the compact region  of intact H5.
Thus of the 89 residues in the polypeptide chain, 5  residues at the N terminus and II residues at the C terminus are missing in the current model. 
This poly-E region is inferred by the curator to be disordered, based on MobiDB-Lite and according to experimental evidence demonstrating that poly-E repeats display random-coil-like conformation (PMID:16949547)

In order to acquire insight into the structure of MBP, we have carried out circular dichroism (CD) experiments on the protein both in the lipid-free and in the lipid-bound form. Our data clearly show that lipid-free MBP is mainly disordered with only a small amount having alpha-helix and beta-sheet motifs.
On the other hand, the lipid-bound form of MBP appears to have a consistent amount of ordered secondary structure.
In particular, the increase in the ordered α- and antiparallel β-structures on going from a polar (LF-MBP) to an apolar (LB-MBP) environment is quite evident. Such an increase corresponds to a loss of the random coil and, to a lesser extent, of the β-turn structures. The “other” type of contributions totally disappear in the LB-MBP spectrum. These results demonstrate that MBP assumes a more ordered conformation in the lipid-bound form.

The CD far-UV spectrum of MBP shows a a large negative peak around 200 nm in aqueous solution, indicative of a disordered conformation of the protein in the unbound state.
In aqueous solution, MBP showed a random coil structure confirmed by its circular dichroism (CD) spectra.
The thermodynamically stable state of aqueous MBP is known to exhibit no secondary structure (15). The CD results also indicate that the protein sample used to examine interaction between MBP and TPI was of a random coil structure. More orderly structures have been ascribed to interactions with other molecules including lipids (22), particularly anionic lipids (25).
Given that MBP is known to specifically interact with the membrane's lipid components, this study was designed to explore the effects of these lipids on the conformation of the protein by examining its interaction with the lipid triphosphoinositide (TPI). 
The presence of the intrinsic lipids around MBP (LB-MBP, spectrum c) causes a further increase in the intensityof the fluorescence emission spectrum and a blue shift of7.5 nm of the maximum.
The  N-terminal  region  from  residue  58  to  the polyproline  motif,  and  the  loop  (residues  149–178)  connecting  strands  βC–βD  are  disordered  and  not  visible  in the electron-density map.
These results seem to support that the polyproline regionis partially disordered without a binding partner, suggesting it is intrinsically flexible.

Comparison of the bound and unbound Nef structures revealed that a proline-rich motif (Pro-x-x-Pro), which is implicated in SH3 binding, is partially disordered in the absence of the binding partner; this motif only fully adopts a left-handed polyproline type II helix conformation upon complex formation with the Fyn SH3 domain.

It is the SH3 domain that restrains its flexibility and stabilizes the PPII helix conformation upon complex formation.
Recent genetic and biochemical studies [20] have shown that Nef blocks a receptor-proximal event in the TCR/CD3 pathway, and that this effect is mediated by the interaction of Nef with a specific SH3 domain present in the TCR complex. Combined with these experiments, our structural data support the identification of Fyn SH3 as the candidate target of Nef in T cells and strengthen the hypothesis that the complex of Nef with the wild-type Fyn kinase forms in vivo. Aberrant TCR-mediated signaling may involve dysfunctional regulation of Fyn by Nef.
The interaction of Nef with the TCR machinery is likely to be critical for AIDS pathogenesis. The resulting alteration in the T-cell activation status and perturbations in TCR-mediated signaling may lead to an increase in virus production and contribute to the immune unresponsiveness of infected T cells.
Residues 71–77 of Nef form a left-handed PP-II helix that spans the strictly conserved PxxP motif. The PP-II helix has side chains emanating in three directions, two of which are utilized for interactions with the SH3 domain (Figure 4).
Proteolytic cleavage of NZF-1a in the absence of zinc initially produced multiple bands. By 60 min the protein was completely digested.
Titration of zinc(II) into the apoprotein led to dispersion of these resonances, indicative of structure formation.
These observations support a CysCysHisCys ligand configuration for the NZF1-type zinc binding domains, indicating that one of the conserved histidines is involved in metal ion binding whereas the other plays some other as-yet-undetermined role.
Metal-stabilized structured regions were identified by partial proteolysis and examined for binding to the β-retinoic acid response element (β-RARE).
In the presence of zinc, multiple bands were observed at early time points. By 1 h, the major products were two fragments of approximately 10 kDa each. These were stable for up to 3 h of digestion.
DNase I footprinting was used to further characterize the DNA binding site.
Gel shift analysis with the β-RARE DNA binding site showed that both fragments are functional DNA binding domains.

The sequence from Thermus thermophilus HB8 described in this article (Q5SGX2) is 100% identical to P27001.
The most pronounced difference between the two states is the ordering of the N-terminal region of the α subunit, which appeared to comprise a coiled-coil structure (helical arm). The helices stretch out into the solvent by 65 Å and are apparently flexible in the absence of intermolecular contacts.

CD spectra showed that the fowl protamine, galline, has an unordered structure rich in reverse turns in neutral solution.
In ET buffer, the spectrum had a positive peak at 224 nm besides a trough near 200 nm. The former peak is probably due to a reverse turn (β-turn) structure (19, 20) and the latter one to an unordered structure (19, 21).
Citrate ions bound specifically to the galline molecule, causing a conformational change in it.
In fact, [θ224] decreased with an increase in citrate concentration (Fig. 1B).

In   both   molecules   ∼40   amino   acids (Pro179–Gly216), located immediately after strand β7 and before strand β8, were not modeled in the current structure because of poor electron density. This poor density suggests that these aminoacids are very flexible.
The dashed line indicates a flexible region (amino acids 179–216) which is not modeled in the current structure.
Human replication protein A: global fold of the N-terminal RPA-70 domain reveals a basic cleft and flexible C-terminal linker
We have solved the global fold of the fragment corresponding to this domain (RPA70 delta 169) and we find residues 8-108 of the N-terminal domain are structured. The remaining C-terminal residues are unstructured and may form a flexible linker to the DNA-binding domain of RPA70.
A heteronuclear 15N-1H NOE spectrum labeled with assigned resonances from the C-terminal linker region. All labeled resonances are negative relative to a control spectrum, indicating fast internal backbone motion in the linker. Almost all other unlabeled resonances are also negative and not from the globular region, we assume they are also from the linker.
The longest (1665 ms) time point of the 15N-T1 experiment shows that the resonances in (a) also have long 15N-T1’s; another strong indication that the C-terminus is flexible
The N-terminal 8–108 amino acid residues form a five-stranded β-barrel capped on both ends by short helices. A 60 residue long flexible segment links the structured domain with the tandem DNA-binding domains of RPA70.
Human replication protein A: global fold of the N-terminal RPA-70 domain reveals a basic cleft and flexible C-terminal linker
We have solved the global fold of the fragment corresponding to this domain (RPA70 delta 169) and we find residues 8-108 of the N-terminal domain are structured. The remaining C-terminal residues are unstructured and may form a flexible linker to the DNA-binding domain of RPA70.
A heteronuclear 15N-1H NOE spectrum labeled with assigned resonances from the C-terminal linker region. All labeled resonances are negative relative to a control spectrum, indicating fast internal backbone motion in the linker. Almost all other unlabeled resonances are also negative and not from the globular region, we assume they are also from the linker.

For the NTD–DBD–DNA complex, the representative ensemble shown in Figure 4E is in agreement with NMR data indicating a highly disordered and flexible domain.
Overall, these data demonstrate a high degree of flexibility of the NTDs that is restrained by the space occupied by the hinge and LBD dimer in the context of the full-length protein.
Experimental evidence of the disordered state of the RXRα NTD was provided by liquid state NMR.
These observations suggest that the RXRα NTD is disordered in solution.
The {1H}-15N NOEs  show that residues 178 to 187 clearly exhibit smaller than average NOE values, indicating increased flexibility in this region.
The second zinc ion is complexed by cysteine residues 171, 177, 187 and 190, forming a second zinc loop.
The non-helical regions of the structure are less well-ordered, in particular the region between the first and second helix, residues 169 to 189.
Iterative rounds of four-fold noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging, solvent flattening, and electron density map interpretation yielded a model comprising 128 residues of RGS4 and virtually all of the Giα1 subunit.
The current model of RGS4–Giα1 contains two molecules of Giα1 (chain A, residues 5–354; chain D, residues 11–354), two molecules of RGS4 (chain E, residues 51–178; chain H, residues 60–175), two citrate ions, and 56 water molecules.
Accordingly, the arms of RGS4 are disordered and play no obvious role either in binding Giα1 or in stabilizing the RGS box.

Residues 1 to 38 are disordered and buried in the RNA in all subunits. Residues 39 to 62 are ordered only in the C subunit.
However, on a TSK gel filtration column equilibrated in buffer A containing 1 mm EGTA or 1 mm Ca2+, it eluted with apparent molecular masses of 320 and 250 kDa, respectively.
Equilibrium gel filtration experiments at low (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) as well as moderately high ionic strength (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl) and a free Ca2+ concentration of 40–60 μm showed that B1–B5 binds 14–15 mol of Ca2+/mol, which seems to be a very good estimation of the total capacity.
Because, except for a blue shift of the minimum to 197 nm, the spectrum of metal-free B1–B5 at 25 °C is very similar, this form must contain very little organized secondary structure.
In contrast, the Ca2+-loaded protein shows discrete peaks: one positive peak at 228 nm, which may be attributable to aromatic residues (26), and two negative peaks at 215 and 195 nm.

Removal of Ca2+ changed the intensity of ellipticity only slightly, with a 2-nm blue shift, indicating that microenvironment of the Tyr residues in apoB1–B5 is asymmetric and therefore structured.

The spectrum of the metal-free protein is quite similar to that of the guanidine-HCl-denatured form, although its intensity is 20% higher, and the maximum blue shifted by 5 nm.
The Ca2+-saturated protein shows a 2.5-fold higher fluorescence intensity and a blue shift from 345 to 323 nm compared with the metal-free state, suggesting that with Ca2+ binding a well organized hydrophobic core is formed around the Trp residue (31).

This poly-E region is inferred by the curator to be disordered, based on MobiDB-Lite and according to experimental evidence demonstrating that poly-E repeats display random-coil-like conformation (PMID:16949547)
The amino-terminal 32 residues are highly disordered, but from residue 33 onwards, including the entire α-crystallin domain (residues 46–135) and thecarboxy-terminal extension, they are well ordered.

Mutant αB-crystallins failed to confer thermotolerance to E. coli BL21(DE3) apart from the D2G mutant which conferred a similar but reduced thermotolerance to that conferred by native αB-crystallin (Fig. 7 and Table I).
Synaptobrevin and both SNAP-25 fragments were largely unstructured, similar to previous results (not shown; see refs 18 and 19).
Furthermore, the syntaxin fragment formed stable complexes either with the N-terminal or with both fragments of SNAP-25 but not with the C-terminal fragment alone (Figure 4, lanes 9 and 10), again consistent with previous results (18).
Formation of these subcomplexes was associated with an increase in α-helical content that was more pronounced than that observed previously for the full-length proteins (Figure 3, columns 13−15; see ref 18].

Analysis of the fragments derived from SNAP-25 revealed that both proteases excised the middle region which contains the putative membrane anchor domain. The resulting N- and C-terminal fragments remained in the SDS-resistant core complex. The N-terminal fragments generated by the two proteases were identical (residues 2−83). The C-terminal fragments generated by trypsin extended from residues 120 or 125 to the C-terminal end of the SNAP-25 construct, including the entire His6 tag.
Synaptobrevin and both SNAP-25 fragments were largely unstructured, similar to previous results (not shown; see refs 18 and 19).
In aqueous media, all peptides (alone or in mixtures) were unstructured, and neither increasing peptide concentration nor changing pH, ionic strength, or divalent cation concentration increased the α-helical content.
In the presence of increasing concentrations of TFE (Fig.2, A–C), there was a significant increase in the α-helical content. The minimal concentration at which the peptides underwent a transition from mostly unstructured to partially structured was approximately 30%.
NACP Exhibits Properties Characteristic of an Extended Protein. The exact molecular weight of the NACP used in this work was found to be [M + H+] = 14 463 (±4.6) by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, consistent with the molecular weight of 14 460 predicted on the basis of the encoded amino acid sequence. On SDS−polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS−PAGE), the protein exhibits an apparent Mr of approximately 19 000 (Uéda et al., 1993), which may be attributable to abnormally low binding of SDS by the highly acidic NACP C-terminal sequence. A similar abnormal mobility has been demonstrated by other highly charged proteins (Williams et al., 1986; Yoo & Albanesi, 1990; Thomas et al., 1991; Gast et al., 1995). 
The NACP C-terminus may bind a cationic target, while the N-terminus may be involved in weak interactions with a membrane cytoplasmic surface. Thus, NACP may serve to carry a cationic target protein to the inner surface of the neuronal membrane or to the outer surface of a vesicle [members of the NACP family have affinity for synaptosomes (Maroteaux & Scheller, 1991; George et al., 1995)].
In contrast, the final 40 residues of αS exhibit secondary shifts that are more evenly distributed between the α and β regions of conformational space, suggesting that they are more highly unfolded and extended.
To attempt to observe NMR resonances from the remaining, N-terminal 102 residues of αS, we raised the temperature of our sample from 10 to 40 °C. At this temperature, we observe a greater number of residues than at 10 °C, as shown in Figure 6. An examination of these resonances shows that they do not, in general correspond to resonances observed for either the free protein, or the protein in the presence of micelles at 10 °C. The number of backbone resonances visible is more than 100, suggesting that these resonances include the missing N-terminal resonances not observed at 10 °C. Many resonances from the free C-terminal portion of the protein are no longer observed, probably because at this temperature, the exchange of the backbone amide protons (which are unprotected in this unfolded segment of the protein) with solvent protons is far more rapid than at the lower temperature, and leads to the broadening of these signals.
These results suggest that one function of αS may be to tether as of yet unidentified partners to lipid surfaces via interactions with its C-terminal tail
The free C-terminal tail of αS may also “reach over” to interact with nearby membrane bound proteins such as PLD2, an enzyme that αS reportedly inhibits (Jenco et al., 1998).
The role of the free C-terminal region of αS is not directly addressed in our studies, but we suggest that this region may mediate interactions of αS with other cytosolic or membrane bound proteins. Indeed, the αS segment responsible for a reported interaction with tau was mapped to the C-terminal region of the protein (Jensen et al., 1999). Such interactions may provide a mechanism for αS to anchor proteins to membranes, or to anchor lipid membranes or vesicles to cytoskeletal structures. The free C-terminal tail of αS may also “reach over” to interact with nearby membrane bound proteins such as PLD2, an enzyme that αS reportedly inhibits (Jenco et al., 1998).
α-Synuclein in central nervous system and from erythrocytes, mammalian cells, and Escherichia coli exists predominantly as disordered monomer.
Our findings demonstrate that both human and rodent α-syn expressed in the central nervous system exist predominantly as an unfolded monomer.
Far-UV CD spectroscopy performed at a protein concentration of 5 μM revealed that both native and heat-treated recombinant α-syn were mostly devoid of any significant secondary structure, as shown by a single spectral minimum at ~195 nm (Fig. 1C). Moreover, we confirmed that both native and denatured preparations are able to bind lipids and adopt an α-helical structure upon binding to 100-nm POPG small unilamellar vesicles.
To advance the understanding of protein-micelle interactions, the present study concludes by showing that, in marked contrast to secondary structure stability, helix dynamics of SLAS-bound αS correlate with the degree of protein-induced departures from free micelle dimensions.

Syn binds to MTs and folds upon interaction with the tubulin α2β2 tetramer
Our data confirmed that Syn is unfolded in the absence of the ligand, whereas an equimolar Syn/tubulin mixture gives an overall secondary structure CD signal, which is more intense than the sum of the signals of the two individual proteins (Fig. 2a). Moreover, the CD signal originating in the mixture shows a gain of signal at 220 nm, which is typical of α-helix structures. Considering that (i) the interaction of tubulin with ligands is widely studied and an increase in its α-helix content has never been observed, and (ii) Syn is a soluble, intrinsically unfolded protein which is able to adopt α-helix structure in adequate conditions

Far-UV CD data from wild-type αS in the presence and absence of SDS micelles, under conditions and protein concentrations (100 μM) identical to those used in the NMR experiments. A large conformational change is evident, with a high degree of helicity (indicated by the characteristic double minima at 208 and 222 nm) formed in the presence of micelles.
To attempt to observe NMR resonances from the remaining, N-terminal 102 residues of αS, we raised the temperature of our sample from 10 to 40 °C.

Figure 5 shows a proton-nitrogen correlation spectrum of αS in the presence of micelles under conditions otherwise identical with those used in studies of the free protein discussed above. Only about 30 backbone NH resonances are apparent in this spectrum, compared with 135 (non-proline) resonances in the spectrum of the free protein. A comparison of the two spectra Figure 1, Figure 5 reveals that the resonances from the micelle containing sample are an exact subset of the resonances from the free protein.
Our observations indicate a partition of αS into two functionally distinct regions. The N-terminal region is responsible for lipid binding. The NMR data suggest that the boundary for this region occurs between residues 102 and 103. Interestingly, the first three exons in the coding region of the αS gene encode residues 1 to 102, and a recent report indicates that the lipid binding capacity of αS is distributed across this region of the protein (Perrin et al., 2000). The close correspondence between the exon-defined boundary and the boundary we observe in our NMR data supports a distinct functional role (lipid binding) for this region of αS.
the disordered nature of monomeric α-synuclein is stably preserved in non-neuronal and neuronal cells
Our results show that exogenously delivered αSyn exists as an N-terminally acetylated, disordered and highly dynamic monomer in neuronal and non-neuronal cells, without detectable signs of oligomerization, spontaneous aggregation, or targeted degradation.

The conformational similarity of NACP to the proteins in Table 1 suggests that it too may function to facilitate protein−protein interactions. The NACP C-terminus may bind a cationic target, while the N-terminus may be involved in weak interactions with a membrane cytoplasmic surface. Thus, NACP may serve to carry a cationic target protein to the inner surface of the neuronal membrane or to the outer surface of a vesicle [members of the NACP family have affinity for synaptosomes (Maroteaux & Scheller, 1991; George et al., 1995)].

The “non-Aβ component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid plaque” (NAC) is a minor peptide component of the insoluble fibrillar core of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuritic plaque. NAC amyloid fibrils seed the polymerization of Aβ1−40, the major AD amyloid protein. NAC is derived from a 14 kDa precursor protein, designated NACP, a member of a highly conserved family of heat-stable brain-specific acidic proteins which have been suggested to be involved in synapse formation and/or stabilization.
This behavior suggests that NAC amyloid may accelerate AD amyloidogenesis by seeding in vivo plaque formation (Han et al., 1995). 
NAC is indicated with bold lettering, and the other peptides used in this work (NACP19−48 and NACP96−125) are underlined.
In contrast to the spectra of the other two peptides, the CD spectrum of a saturated solution (11 μM) of the NAC peptide (NACP61−95) in aqueous buffer indicated a significant degree of β-sheet structure (ca. 35% β, Figure 3B). Similar CD spectra have been measured for aqueous solutions of Aβ amyloid peptides (Barrow & Zagorski, 1991).

To attempt to observe NMR resonances from the remaining, N-terminal 102 residues of αS, we raised the temperature of our sample from 10 to 40 °C. At this temperature, we observe a greater number of residues than at 10 °C, as shown in Figure 6. An examination of these resonances shows that they do not, in general correspond to resonances observed for either the free protein, or the protein in the presence of micelles at 10 °C. The number of backbone resonances visible is more than 100, suggesting that these resonances include the missing N-terminal resonances not observed at 10 °C. Many resonances from the free C-terminal portion of the protein are no longer observed, probably because at this temperature, the exchange of the backbone amide protons (which are unprotected in this unfolded segment of the protein) with solvent protons is far more rapid than at the lower temperature, and leads to the broadening of these signals.
The C-terminal part of the protein does not associate with either vesicles or micelles, remaining free and unfolded.
Here, we present results from NMR studies showing that the N-terminal region of αS binds to both lipid vesicles and lipid-mimetic detergent micelles and adopts an extended helical conformation, while the C-terminal region of the protein remains unbound and available for potential interactions with other proteins.
Using the assignments obtained for the free protein, it is possible to assign the resonances visible in the presence of SDS micelles, and the result indicates that these resonances correspond exactly to the C-terminal residues of the protein, starting at position 103 in the sequence. The most plausible interpretation of this result is that these C-terminal residues populate the exact same conformation(s) as in the free protein in even in the presence of micelles, and are thus not bound to the micelles.
Many resonances from the free C-terminal portion of the protein are no longer observed, probably because at this temperature, the exchange of the backbone amide protons (which are unprotected in this unfolded segment of the protein) with solvent protons is far more rapid than at the lower temperature, and leads to the broadening of these signals.
In either case (slow tumbling of a complex or exchange broadening), it is clear that the portion of the protein corresponding to the N-terminal 100 residues interacts with the SDS micelles, whereas the C-terminal 40 residues do not.
Resonances are observed for (non-proline) residues 108 to 140 of the protein. The absence of residues 103 to 108, which are observed with micelles but not with vesicles, may be due to the fact that a longer flexible stretch of residues is required to isolate the unbound portion of the protein from the slow tumbling motions of the much larger lipid vesicle.
The C-terminal 40 residues of αS appear to lack any secondary structure bias, and can be considered to be in a fully random conformation, at least by the chemical shift criterion. This lack of structure is maintained in the lipid bound form.
The role of the free C-terminal region of αS is not directly addressed in our studies, but we suggest that this region may mediate interactions of αS with other cytosolic or membrane bound proteins. Indeed, the αS segment responsible for a reported interaction with tau was mapped to the C-terminal region of the protein (Jensen et al., 1999). Such interactions may provide a mechanism for αS to anchor proteins to membranes, or to anchor lipid membranes or vesicles to cytoskeletal structures. The free C-terminal tail of αS may also “reach over” to interact with nearby membrane bound proteins such as PLD2, an enzyme that αS reportedly inhibits (Jenco et al., 1998).
Although the C-terminus is more dynamically constrained in fibrils and in α-syn bound to TOCL:DOPC vesicles, a direct comparison of carbon chemical shifts detected using through bond two-dimensional spectroscopy indicates that the C-terminus is flexible and unstructured in all the three samples.

The detected backbone chemical shifts indicate that the C-terminus is unstructured when bound to DOPA:DOPC lipid vesicles (Figure S1), in agreement with previous solution and solid-state NMR data (Ulmer et al. 2005; Fusco et al. 2014).

In fact, under these experimental conditions, the CD trace lacks the characteristic local minima at 208/222 nm (Figure 2, spectrum a).
The addition of TFE significantly alters the structure of the N domain.
The amount of induced secondary structure reaches a plateau between 40 and 50% TFE.
In the presence of 50% TFE, TTF-1 N domain is almost undigested (lane 3), confirming the evidence of gain of secondary structure (α-helix) obtained from CD studies.
The fragment of approx. 2 kDa was eluted from gel and subjected to N-terminal protein sequencing. The sequence identifies a fragment of 20 residues between residues 58 and 78 (Figure 1, left-hand panel, boxed).
The SDS/PAGE analysis of the proteolysis mixture after 6 h reaction at 25 °C (Figure 3) reveals that, in the absence of TFE, the TTF-1 N domain is completely digested by thermolysin into small peptides which are not stained by Coomassie Blue (lane 2).
Therefore these data indicate that the TTF-1 N domain is able to efficiently activate transcription in yeast, a property typical of acidic activation domains.
As shown in Figure 7(A), only the N domain was able to retain TBP. This interaction is specific, as confirmed by the SDS/PAGE shown in Figure 7(B), which demonstrates that only the TBP band (arrow) is enriched after elution.
The PEVK domain of the giant muscle protein titin is a proline-rich sequence with unknown secondary/tertiary structure. 
It is still debated whether the PEVK domain adopts a specific secondary/tertiary structure.
The analysis revealed that cardiac PEVK titin acts as an entropic spring with the properties of a random coil exhibiting mechanical conformations of different flexibility.
Thus, the results may be interpreted to indicate binding of the constitutively expressed PEVK segment (“cardiac PEVK”) to actin filaments in both cardiac and skeletal muscle. In contrast, PEVK sequences present only in skeletal titins may exhibit little actin-binding propensity.
In all of the chemically synthesized and expressed peptides, unordered coils were the major secondary structure identified.
Circular dichroism (CD) experiments demonstrated that both the positively charged PPAK modules and the negatively charged PolyE repeats had similar spectral properties with disordered secondary structure predominating.
The N terminus is largely disordered; good density starts at Pro-26, and this region does not change between hTS, NTE-hTS, and an inhibitory ternary complex of hTS with dUMP and Tomudex (ZD1694 or raltitrexed) (4) or analogous rat TS complex (PDB entry 2tsr(3)).
Region 107–128, which includes the insert, is disordered in the crystals.
The search model did not include 27 residues at the amino terminus, and two insertions of 12 and 8 amino acids residues that are highly conserved in eukaryotic species of TS at residues 90 (hi 17) to 101 (hi28), and inserted between 156 and 157 (h 146—hi52) respectively (Perry et al., 1990).
A random coil sequence yields a very typical CD spectrum, with a sharp negative minimum at 198 nm. The recorded CD spectra of ERα-N and ERβ-N both show this characteristic profile (Figs. 5 and 6). The CD data therefore strengthen the conclusion from NMR that the ERα-N and ERβ-N fragments are unstructured in solution.
The most likely cause for the observed effect is that the structured TBP induces a folding event in the unstructured ERα-N transactivation region.
The HSQC spectra of ERα-N recorded in buffers with a neutral or basic pH contain very few and weak signals compared with the spectra recorded in buffers with acidic pH (data not shown). Likewise, backbone amide NMR signals decrease significantly as the temperature is increased from 5 to 20 °C (data not shown). Both effects reflect significant hydrogen exchange between amide protons and water at higher temperature and pH in the absence of stable intramolecular hydrogen bonds. 
Superpositions onto the appropriate average structure were made using the Ca, N and C atoms of residues 4-35 and 59-74, since the backbone conformation at the termini and between residues 36 and 58 is comparatively poorly defined by the NMR data.
The residues 36-58 of the peptide analized by the autors corresponds to the 214-236 region of the protein.

The residues 75-84 of the peptide analized by the autors, which lacks structure, corresponds to the 252-261 region of the protein.
Fig. 3 Aillustrates the injection of purified yTBP over the surfaces captured with ΕRα-N (solid line) and ERβ-N (dotted line), respectively. The sensogram clearly shows binding of TBP to ERα-N but no significant binding to ERβ-N. 
TBP is a key protein of the transcription machinery and has been proposed as a target factor for a number of transcriptional activators.
The main chain structure of ER(287–305) in the absence of CaM is unstructured, although it adopts an α-helical structure upon binding to CaM (Fig. 2).

Recombinant SET7 methylated an ER peptide encompassing amino acids 294-314 of the hinge region, whereas two other histone H3 lysine 9-specific HMTases, G9a and Dim-5, did not (Figure 1B). In contrast, all three enzymes were able to methylate a histone H3 peptide (amino acids 1-24), suggesting that the methylation of the ER peptide by SET7 is specific.
Subsequent MS/MS analysis identified lysine 302 (K302) as the single site of methylation (Figure S1C).
Taken together, these data indicate that SET7-mediated methylation modulates the stability of ER and this effect is mediated through modification at K302.
Methylated ER was detected in cells expressing wild-type ER, but not the ER-K302R mutant (Figure 2A).
These data indicate that ER is methylated at K302 in vivo, and that the neighboring lysine, K303, impacts methylation of K302 by SET7.
Taken together, these data indicate that SET7-mediated methylation modulates the stability of ER and this effect is mediated through modification at K302.
Results showed that 14-3-3β bound to the AF-1 domain of ERα; however, the DBD and AF-2 domains did not bind to 14-3-3β (Fig. 2C).
 These results indicate that 14-3-3β interacts with ERα through the AF-1 domain of ERα in a ligand-dependent manner and Akt phosphorylation is critical in this event.
As expected, autoacetylation of GST-p300 was seen in all of the lanes, and WT ERα was efficiently and selectively acetylated by p300. In contrast, all of the K303 substitutions were hypoacetylated.
We found that the S294A mutation had little effect on ERα phosphorylation but that the S305D mutation greatly reduced the phosphorylation of the ERα fragment.
Taking all of the information into account, gel filtration, sedimentation, and CD analyses, we conclude that the amino-terminal 174 resides of Topo I are largely unfolded and are comprised of very little if any extended secondary structure.
Evidence from limited proteolysis studies (see accompanying paper(40)) indicates that the former possibility is more likely to be correct. For example limited trypsin digestion of full-length Topo I generates a proteolytically resistant 55-kDa fragment that starts at residue Lys654 and ends somewhere very close to residue Lys654 (Fig. 1A in (40)).
The side chains of Lys436, His632, and Asn722 and the main chain amide nitrogens of Asn491, Gln633, and Ala635 make contacts closer than 3.5 Å in this complex but not in the covalent complex (Fig. 4G; note that residues 628 to 635 are disordered and are not present in the structure of the covalent complex).
Thus, residues ∼636 to 712, which form the so-called linker domain, contribute to but are not required for activity (16).
The ∼210-residue NH2-terminal region of human topo I is highly charged, contains very few hydrophobic amino acids, and is largely disordered (12).
The only significant differences between the structures occur in the active-site region (as discussed below); in addition, residues 628 to 635 of subdomain III and 715 to 719 of the COOH-terminal domain are ordered in the noncovalent complex but are disordered in the covalent complex.
While designing the purification scheme, we noticed that long term storage of nuclear extracts leads to proteolysis of the full-length enzyme into a fragments of 75 and 70 kDa, designated f-Topo75 and f-Topo70, respectively (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5). 
Amino terminal sequencing confirmed that f-Topo75 was missing the first 137 residues while f-Topo70 was missing the first 174 residues.
In agreement with this finding, an N-terminal fragment of human topo I (amino acids 1–218) binds DNA in a filter binding assay (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, the obtained results suggest a role of the N-terminal domain or at least part of it in non-covalent DNA binding.

The disorder region is missing from the pdb but not metioned in the article.

The segment of 48 amino acids between the two subfragments (residues 634-681) is disordered.
In conjunction with the low hNOE values, lack of protection from exchange, low R1,H values, and random-coil chemical shift values, the results confirm that the N-terminal region displays all the hallmarks of an unstructured polypeptide, right up to S103 or F104, the first hydrogen-bonded residue of the first zinc-finger.
Mutation and deletion analyses of ADR1 have identified the two (Cys2,His2) zinc fingers, residues 103 to 155, plus approximately 20 residues preceding the first finger, the proximal region, as the minimal portion of ADR1 capable of sequence-specific binding to the DNA promoter sequence UAS1 (upstream activation sequence 1; Thukral et al 1991a, Thukral et al 1991b).
We conclude that the region of ADR1-DBD essential for high-affinity binding undergoes a disorder-to-order transition upon binding to its cognate DNA and, together with the zinc fingers, forms a cohesive molecular complex with the nucleic acid.
ADR1-DBD undergoes a disorder-to-order transition upon binding to its cognate DNA, with the largest changes occurring in the N-terminal proximal region.
We have used a set of HN-HN NOEs derived from a perdeuterated protein–DNA complex to describe the fold of ADR1 bound to the UAS1 binding site.
The region responsible for sequence-specific DNA binding by the transcription factor ADR1 contains two Cys2–His2 zinc fingers and an additional N-terminal proximal accessory region (PAR).
The N-terminal (non-finger) PAR is unstructured in the absence of DNA and undergoes a folding transition on binding the DNA transcription target site.
The dramatic chemical shift perturbations of the N-terminus upon DNA binding are remarkably consistent with mutagenesis data that previously defined the essential N-terminal region. 1H and 13C chemical shift perturbation become significant starting at residue 86.
Furthermore the residues more perturbed lie between P87 and P97, flanking the site of the affinity-enhancing suppressor mutation R91K.
The study concluded that the two zinc fingers are pre-structured and do not undergo significant conformational change upon DNA binding. In contrast, residues 86 to 102 in the N-terminal proximal region exhibit large chemical shift perturbations upon DNA binding and do not exhibit regular secondary structure in either the free or bound form [from PMID:9642072].
The severely perturbed N-terminus does not appear to interact with the exposed, unperturbed portions of the zinc finger in the protein-DNA complex.
These data taken together suggest that the region P87-P97 plays a role in contacting DNA and therby increases the binding affinity of the construct.
We show here that the C-terminal activation domain of human c-Fos (residues 216−380; Figure 1), although functionally active, is essentially devoid of the stable helical or β-sheet structure typical of globular proteins. We conclude that c-Fos contains an intrinsically disordered yet biologically active activation domain.
Instead, the spectrum contains a negative band at 198 nm and a shoulder centered at 220 nm (above 5 °C), which are indicative of a disordered conformation ( 33).
The CD spectrum of FosAD at 5 °C is reminiscent of an unfolded protein (Figure 1A), in accord with previous results.

The heteronuclear 1H-15N NOE provides information on mainchain flexibility. In particular, 1H-15N NOEs are positive in folded, globular proteins and reduced or negative in unfolded and disordered proteins ( 37−41).
The recorded CD spectra of ERα-N and ERβ-N both show this characteristic profile (Figs. 5 and 6). The CD data therefore strengthen the conclusion from NMR that the ERα-N and ERβ-N fragments are unstructured in solution.
Similarly, the HSQC spectrum of ERβ-N (Fig. 2 B) also has a very limited amide chemical shift dispersion that corresponds well with typical random coil resonance shifts.
On the other hand, 1H-15N HSQC and CD spectra of free dTAFII23011–77 indicate that dTAFII23011–77 by itself is largely unfolded (Figure 2C).
During a titration experiment in which 1H-15N HSQC spectra of dTAFII23011–77 were recorded with successive additions of TBP, most peaks corresponding to the unfolded state decrease in intensity and appear at new positions corresponding to the folded state, consistent with the high affinity of dTAFII23011–77 for TBP (Kd approximately 10−9 M).

This poly-E region is inferred by the curator to be disordered, based on MobiDB-Lite and according to experimental evidence demonstrating that poly-E repeats display random-coil-like conformation (PMID:16949547)
The eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) is the core of a multicomponent switch controlling gene expression at the level of translation initiation. It interacts with the small ribosomal subunit interacting protein, eIF3, and the eIF4E/cap-mRNA complex in order to load the ribosome onto mRNA during cap-dependent translation. We describe the solution structure of the complex between yeast eIF4E/cap and eIF4G (393-490). Binding triggers a coupled folding transition of eIF4G (393-490) and the eIF4E N terminus resulting in a molecular bracelet whereby eIF4G (393-490) forms a right-handed helical ring that wraps around the N terminus of eIF4E.

Here we report that a 98-amino acid fragment of S. cerevisiae eIF4G1 that contains this eIF4E binding peptide undergoes an unfolded to folded transition upon binding to eIF4E. The folding of the eIF4G1 domain was evidenced by the eIF4E-dependent changes in its protease sensitivity and (1)H-(15)N HSQC NMR spectrum.

The 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectrum of eIF4G1 1-249 is characteristic of an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) with low dispersion in the proton dimension and sharp signals (Figure 1B).
Analysis of eIF4G1 1-249 secondary structure based on 13C chemical shifts, T1/T2 15N relaxation times and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) revealed the presence of an α-helix within BOX3 (Figure 2A). This finding was confirmed by characteristic sequential amide-amide NOEs measured in a 3D 1H-15N-HSQC-NOESY-1H-15N HSQC spectrum (Supplementary Figure S3). We determined the NMR structure of this α-helix using a BOX3 model peptide (eIF4G1 187-234) (Supplementary Figure S3). No further standard secondary structure elements were identified in eIF4G11-249.
The SAXS curve evidenced the IDP nature of eIF4G11-249 (Figure 2C).
Here we mapped this interaction on eIF4G11-249 by analysis of changes on the 1H-15N HSQC spectra, which indicated three putative binding sites for RRM3 in eIF4G11-249 (orange bar chart in Figure 3A): two in RNA1 (RNA1-1 and RNA1-2) and one in BOX1. Strikingly, these sites have a small consensus sequence motif (YNNxxxY), only present in this region of the eIF4G1.
We tested the ability of short peptides of eIF4G1 that corresponded to the conserved elements (Figure 3B) to bind to 15N-labelled Pub1 RRM3, by monitoring their effect on the Pub1 RRM3 1H-15N HSQC spectrum. Only BOX1 and RNA1-1 peptides caused changes in the Pub1 spectrum arising from direct contacts (Figure 3B).

The NMR spectrum of the eIF4G1 peptide fused to the C-terminus of Pub1 was similar to that of Pub1 RRM3 alone (Figure 4A right), whereas that of the N-terminally fused chimera differed significantly (Figure 4A, left), suggesting that the peptide can effectively fold-back into the binding site only in the latter case. Using this latter construct, we obtained enough experimental restraints to calculate the structure of the eIF4G135-49-Pub1 RRM3 chimera (PDB: 6Z29), which shed light on the key elements required for molecular recognition (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure S8).

We next studied the interaction between eIF4G1 and Pab1 using similar approaches. NMR titrations of unlabeled Pab1 RRM12 over 15N-eIF4G11-249 (blue bar chart in Figure 3A) caused similar pattern of perturbations and signal disappearance than Pub1 RRM3 but with additional changes in BOX2 (aa 135–160) and BOX3 (aa 200–234).
The BOX2 peptide also interacted with RRM2 through a similar interface; but probably weakly because it causes fewer changes than the BOX3 peptide.

As expected, the BOX3 peptide interacted with Pab1 RRM12 causing significant perturbations in the helix1-helix2 interface of RRM2 (Figure 3C right), an equivalent region to that involved in human eIF4G-PABP1 recognition (Safaee et al., 2012).
However, surprisingly, titration with eIF4G11-184 cause the disappearance of nearly all of the Pub1 RRM3 1H-15N HSQC crosspeaks (Figure 5A right).
We further investigate the cause of Pub1 RRM3 behavior and discovered that it recover the weak-binding pattern with several eIF4G11-184 BOX1 mutants (ΔBOX1, W95A, Y98A/Y99A, and Y105A/Y106A), whereas deletion of BOX2 (ΔBOX2) still caused the Pub1 aggregation-like pattern. 
Macroscopically, eIF4G11-184 (and eIF4G11-184 ΔBOX1) samples age to hydrogels that bind Congo-red (Supplementary Figure S5C), a dye used to detect amyloids and protein aggregates (Yakupova et al., 2019), but eIF4G11-184 ΔBOX1 does not.
These NMR analyses suggested a two-key mechanism whereby Pub1 and Pab1 bind to eIF4G1 causing conformational changes that promote BOX1 self-assembly (Figure 5C). 
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicated that large aggregates were formed in some protein combinations (Figure 6A). In contrast, the individual proteins exhibited autocorrelation functions that did not differ from that of Ficoll-70 alone, suggesting that the individual proteins did not aggregate. Moreover, the curve profiles of the single proteins remained stable for several hours. The Pab1:Pub1 mixture (Figure 6, row 2, column 1) showed the same behavior, but other double protein mixtures and the triple one showed a second phase, evidencing the presence of micrometer-size particles.

Consistent with this using the eIF4G1 ΔBOX1 mutant in the triple mixture showed no aggregation (Figure 6, row 3, column 2).
Confocal fluorescence microscopy images of triple mixtures containing Pab1 RRM12, Pub1 RRM123 and Alexa 488 labelled eIF4G11-249 in Ficoll 70 (200 g/L) revealed the presence of discrete rounded particles (∼1 µm and smaller, Figure 6B upper panels). Both, Pab1 and Pub1 were observed to colocalize with eIF4G1 in these assemblies, as observed in fluorescent images in which the proteins were pairwise labelled with spectrally different dyes (Alexa 488 and Alexa 647, Figure 6B middle and lower panels). 
We titrate the eIF4G11-82 construct with three poly (A) probes and found that the strength of the interaction is higher with longer oligos (Figure 7A). The chemical shift changes almost doubled when going from A12 to A14 and a new signal appears in the spectra that corresponds to the side chain Arg guanidinium group (Nε-Hε) (Figure 7B).
The interaction with poly(A) maps three regions centered around R34, R55, and G65, peaking at R55PH57. In contrast, the canonical RGG box (R60GG), a well-known RNA binding motif (Thandapani et al., 2013; Chong et al., 2018; Chowdhury and Jin, 2022), is less affected by binding.
Typical titration curves for three of the proteins are shown in Figure 1C​1C.. We cleaved the GST moiety from the fusion proteins for these experiments; however, control experiments showed that GST fusion proteins behave identically in RNA-binding experiments. Full-length eIF4G11–952 showed the highest affinity for RNA with an estimated KD (KDapprox.) of 5 × 10−8 M whereas the fragments eIF4G11–82, eIF4G1492–539, and eIF4G1883–952 show about 100-fold lower affinity.
The fragments eIF4G1160–492, eIF4G1542–883 (not shown), and eIF4G1592–862, as well as GST (used as negative control) did not bind significant amounts of RNA.
We tested full-length eIF4G11–952 and the fragments eIF4G11–82, eIF4G1492–539, and eIF4G1883–952 carrying RNA-binding sites as determined by filter-binding assays. 
We conclude from these results that eIF4G1 contains at least three sites, amino acids 1–82, 492–539, and 883–952, able to interact with RNA.
In all three spectra, the dispersion of resonances is over a narrow range in the 1HN-dimension, indicating that both Gcn4 ADs are intrinsically disordered in the absence of binding partners.
The NOE pattern was typical for a random conformation; furthermore, the weakness of the NOEs indicates a large inherent flexibility of the unstructured p65 C terminus. 
The results of the CD analysis are shown in Fig. 2A. The negative e value at a wavelength of 190 nm and the 0 value near 0 at wavelengths exceeding 210 nm is indicative for a random conformation of the TA, peptides in an aqueous buffer at pH 7.
We show here that an essential element in the interaction of p53 with HMGB1 is the N-terminal disordered region (Lee et al., 2000; Dawson et al., 2003; Wells et al., 2008), comprising the transactivation domain and the proline-rich region, the major interacting motif being a region of inducible structure in TAD2 (Lee et al., 2000).
RDC analysis showed that the isolated domain p53(1–93) was an IDP with two regions of nascent secondary structure.
Our final model of the quadruple mutant comprises residues 96–290 for both molecules in the asymmetric unit. As in the structure of wild type, the C-terminal residues up to Thr-312 are disordered.
SAXS data were accurately reproduced by intensity curves simulated from the ensemble of p53(1–93) conformers that reproduced the RDC data (shown in the form of a semilogarithmic and a Kratky-type plot in Fig. 2), demonstrating that the overall shape of the predicted and measured ensembles was consistent with the model of the unfolded chain described above. The SAXS profile was not consistent with a collapsed structure of the transactivation domain, reported from paramagnetic relaxation enhancement experiments (Fig. S7) (28).
This short helix interacts with the surface of Tfb1 formed by beta strands b5, b6, and b7 and the loop connecting b5 to b6.
The interaction between the p62/Tfb1 subunit of TFIIH and the TAD of p53 has been shown to be important for the recruitment of p53 to the TFIIH complex in both human and yeast. This interaction is directly correlated with the ability of the p53 TAD to stimulate transcriptional elongation (Blau et al., 1996).
In contrast, the N-terminal p53 transactivation domain is largely disordered in solution, but residues 37-57 fold into two amphipathic helices, H1 and H2, upon binding with RPA70N.
Here we report the crystal structure of RPA residues 1-120 (RPA70N) bound to the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 (residues 37-57; p53N) and, by using NMR spectroscopy, characterize two mechanisms by which the RPA/p53 interaction can be modulated.

The crystal structure of the 109-residue amino-terminal domain of MDM2 bound to a 15-residue transactivation domain peptide of p53 revealed that MDM2 has a deep hydrophobic cleft on which the p53 peptide binds as an amphipathic alpha helix.

Here, we report that the conserved bromo-domain of the transcriptional coactivator CBP (CREB binding protein) binds specifically to p53 at the C-terminal acetylated lysine 382. This bromodomain/acetyl-lysine binding is responsible for p53 acetylation-dependent coactivator recruitment after DNA damage, a step essential for p53-induced transcriptional activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 in G1 cell cycle arrest.
This binding is dependent upon K382 acetylation of the peptide with a KD of ∼50 μM, as estimated from NMR titration.
These results confirm that the CBP bromodomain can specifically interact with p53 acetylated at K382.

p53-Induced p21 Activation Requires the CBP Bromodomain/p53 AcK382 Interaction
P53 region 367-386 binds to CBP upon K382 acetylation and undergoes disorder-to-order transition upon binding
Here, we reveal the recognition mechanism of the phosphorylated TAD2 bound to a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain from human TFIIH subunit p62 in an extended string-like conformation.
Although the isolated phosphorylated TAD2 seems to be intrinsically disordered, an extended and ordered structure was induced between residues 47–58 upon binding to the PH domain

 We have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of human Mdmx bound to a 15-residue transactivation domain peptide of human p53.
 We have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of human Mdmx bound to a 15-residue transactivation domain peptide of human p53.
The surface area occupied by aminoacids 17–27 of the p53 peptide has 440 Å2 for human Mdmx and 407 Å2 for zebrafish Mdmx.
The A box interacts with residues 38-61 (TAD2) of the p53 transactivation domain. Residues 19-26 (TAD1) bind weakly, but only in the context of p53(1-93) and not as a free TAD1 peptide. We have solved the structure of the A-box/p53(1-93) complex by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Residues with resonances undergoing significant chemical-shift changes were located in the region spanning residues 18–57, which contains the elements of nascent secondary structure, namely TAD1 (residues 14–28) and TAD2 (residues 38–61) (Lee et al., 2000), with the largest changes occurring in TAD2.
The isolated p53(1–93) fragment and the A box interact (Figure 2F), and an estimate of the affinity (Kd 346 nM) was obtained by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)

The crystal structure of a ternary complex of Set9 with a p53 peptide and the cofactor product S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy) provides the molecular basis for recognition of p53 by this lysine methyltransferase.
We show that the N-terminal domain of USP7 binds two closely spaced 4-residue sites in both p53 and MDM2, falling between p53 residues 359-367 and MDM2 residues 147-159.
Here we detail the molecular mechanisms for the recognition of p53K370me2 and p53K382me2 by 53BP1. The solution structures of TTD in complex with the p53K370me2 and p53K382me2 peptides show a remarkable plasticity of 53BP1 in accommodating these diverse dimethyllysine-containing sequences. We demonstrate that dimeric TTDs are capable of interacting with the two PTMs on a single p53K370me2K382me2 peptide, greatly strengthening the 53BP1-p53 interaction.

A peptide derived from this region of p53 (residues 367-388) was found to have no regular structure in its native form by NMR spectroscopy, but becomes helical when bound to Ca2+ loaded S100B(betabeta).

Crystal structure of a C-terminal acetylated (Lys382) peptide of P53 bound to Sir2 homologue from Thermatoga maritima (Sir2Tm). 
We have solved the high resolution crystal structures of the full-length SMYD2 protein in binary complex with its cofactor S-adenosylmethionine and in ternary complex with cofactor product S-adenosylhomocysteine and p53 substrate peptide (residues 368-375), respectively.
SMYD2 belongs to a subfamily of histone lysine methyltransferase and was recently identified to methylate tumor suppressor p53 and Rb. Here we report that SMYD2 prefers to methylate p53 Lys-370 over histone substrates in vitro. Consistently, the level of endogenous p53 Lys-370 monomethylation is significantly elevated when SMYD2 is overexpressed in vivo.
CTD Domain and EDEE Motif Are Important for p53 Lys-370 Methylation by SMYD2
Crystal structure of a C-terminal peptide of P53 in complex with Sirt1
Here, we report the NMR structure of the complex of the Taz2 (C/H3) domain of p300 and the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53. In the complex, p53 forms a short alpha helix and interacts with the Taz2 domain through an extended surface.
Here, we report the NMR structure of the complex of the Taz2 (C/H3) domain of p300 and the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53. In the complex, p53 forms a short alpha helix and interacts with the Taz2 domain through an extended surface.
Our structural and binding studies allow better understanding of the molecular basis for the increased binding affinity between Taz2 and p531-39 upon phosphorylation at Ser15 and Thr18.
Figure 5a shows that residues 39–59 have the largest resonance intensity changes in the presence of hRPA701–168 with residues 42–56 having intensity ratios that are >10.
The amide 1H and 15N chemical shifts of an uniformly 15N-labeled sample of p53TAD were also monitored before and after the addition of unlabeled hRPA701-168. In the presence of unlabeled hRPA701-168, resonance lineshapes increased and corresponding intensity reductions were observed for specific p53TAD residues. The largest intensity reductions were observed for p53TAD residues 42-56.
For instance, the mean values of R1, R2, R1ρ and the NHNOE for free p53TAD are consistent with values expected for an intrinsically unstructured protein (67).
The CD spectrum of p53 TAD peptide at neutral pH showed no apparent alpha-helical structure when analyzed byYang’s method (Fig. 4A; Ref. 50).
Although the text only mentions the lack of a helical structure, the CD spectrum shows that the peptide is in fact disordered.
The p53 TAD and mutant derivatives were assayed for the ability to bind in vitro translated human TBP in a GST pull-down assay as described under“Materials and Methods.”
As shown in Fig.3Band Table I, the levels of TBP precipitated by GST-p53 TAD and mutant derivatives are linearly correlated with the abilityof transactivation in vivo.

The p53 TAD2 in the complex is unstructured except for a short amphipathic α helix involving residues 47–55.
Chemical shift analysis and the NOE pattern demonstrated that p53 in complex with Tfb1 adopts an a-helical fold that extends from Pro47 to Thr55. Outside this region, p53 is flexible, as also supported by the 15N-1H heteronuclear NOE data.

The N-terminal region is dynamically disordered in the full-length p53 tetramer, fluctuating between states in which it is free and fully exposed to solvent and states in which it makes transient contacts with the DNA-binding domain (DBD).
The cross-peaks in the spectrum of uniformly labeled p53 (black in Fig. 1C) are from residues in the disordered regions: The resonances of the folded DBD and TET domains are severely broadened in HSQC spectra of the 180-kDa tetramer, and their resonances are not visible.
The N-terminal region is dynamically disordered in the full-length p53 tetramer, fluctuating between states in which it is free and fully exposed to solvent and states in which it makes transient contacts with the DNA-binding domain (DBD).
In addition to the chemical shift changes, residues in both AD1 and AD2 have decreased cross-peak intensity in the p53 tetramer relative to the peptide (Fig. 2C). While the intensity loss is greater for AD2 than AD1, it is clear that intramolecular interactions within full-length p53 affect the conformational ensemble and dynamics of both motifs.
Cross-peaks in spectra of 15N-labeled p53(1–61), p53(1–312), and 15NNTAD–p53 fall along a line, suggesting that p53(1–312) and the segmentally labeled full-length p53 experience the same two-site exchange process between states in which the NTAD is free or bound to the DBD.
With the spin label at S15C, cross-peaks of residues in both the AD1 and AD2 regions are broadened; similarly, attachment of the spin label at P58C broadens resonances associated with both the AD2 and AD1 motifs, confirming the presence of interactions between these motifs (SI Appendix, Fig. S4). Transient interactions between the AD1 and AD2 regions have been observed previously in isolated NTAD peptides (59). In addition, selective resonance broadening is observed for several DBD cross-peaks (SI Appendix, Fig. S4), indicating intramolecular interactions between the spin labeled NTAD and the DBD.
With the spin label at P58C (AD2), the largest PRE is observed for residues located in the DNA-binding site; these include T118 and V122 in the L1 loop, G245 and to a lesser extent N247 in the L3 loop, A276, and G279, R280, and R283 in the C-terminal helix.

Taken together, the NMR and fluorescence data suggest a model in which the p53 NTAD can inhibit binding to nontarget DNA but does not affect binding to a cognate recognition element.

In addition, all of the new resonance peaks observed in the p53 construct containing the C-terminal domain (Fig. 3b) appear at frequencies typical of unstructured amides (-8 p.p.m. in the proton dimension). This suggests that the C-terminal domain is not likely to be folded into regular secondary structure.
In contrast, the behavior of the C-terminal domain was best characterized as unstructured and highly mobile, with chemical shift values close to random coil.
The position of the p53 helix allows Phe19, Trp23, and Leu26, which are aligned along its hydrophobic face, to insert deep inside the MDM2 cleft (Fig. 5A), and pack with the cleft in a complementary fashion (Fig. 5B).
In certain cancers, MDM2 amplification is a common event and contributes to the inactivation of p53.
In normal cells, MDM2 and p53 form a negative feedback loop that helps to limit the growth-suppressing activity of p53.
The region 19-26 corresponds to a destruction/degron motif that binds to the MDM2 E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase.
Dynamic quenching constants for both GV-5HW442 and GV-5HW473 are thus of the same order of magnitude as that for free 5-OH-Trp. Consistent with the quenching study of GAL4-VP16 containing natural Trp(64), these results suggest that residues 442 and 473 are solvent-exposed.
GV-5HW442 and GV-5HW473 are in-frame fusions of GV to the VP16 activation domain (amino acids 413-490) with the incorporation of 5-hydroxytryptophan at position 442 or 473, respectively.
The presence of TBP altered the solvent accessibility of both residue 442 and 473. The downward curves of the Stern-Volmer plots were best fit to a two-species model, with approximately 40% of the probe molecules being inaccessible to acrylamide (assumed Ksv of 0) and an accessible fraction of approximately 60% having a Ka of 4.0 M-1 or 7.0 M-1 for GV-7AW442 or GV-7AW473, respectively." Results "However, TFIIB did alter the solvent accessibility of GV-7AW473. Its Stern-Volmer plot was downward curved; in a two-species model, approximately 30% of the probe was inaccessible, and the accessible fraction had a Ka of 4.9 M-1.

The anisotropy decays of the activator proteins (tested in the absence of target proteins) were best fit to two components: a subnanosecond fast decay component representing segmental motion around the 5-OH-Trp fluorophore and the slower decay component in the range of 2-6 ns. In all of these proteins, the segmental motion contributed at least 60% of the anisotropy decay. The extent of these segmental motions were comparable with those of the known most flexible proteins(42).
The peptides GV-5HW442 and GV-5HW473, studied in this publication, are in-frame fusions of GV to the VP16 activation domain (amino acids 413-490) with the incorporation of 5-hydroxytryptophan at position 442 or 473, respectively.
The addition of TBP to GV-5HW442 resulted in a large saturable increment in its anisotropy (Fig. 6A), indicating a large decrease in the mobility of the 5-OH-Trp fluorophore. Assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry for the GAL4-VP16•TBP complex, the dissociation constant for the interaction was calculated to be 3.3 (± 1.7) × 10-7M.
When the analog was incorporated at position 473 of the full-length activation domain (GV-5HW473), the anisotropy also increased rapidly as TBP was added to the system, and the anisotropy reached a limiting value (Fig. 6C). The calculated dissociation constant for this interaction is 2.6 (± 0.6) × 10-8M.

The Trp473 in the full-length activation domain context displayed an emission maximum centered at 349 ± 2 nm, while a C subdomain yielded an emission maximum centered at 348 ± 2 nm. All of these emission wavelength maxima resemble those of fully exposed Trp residues, suggesting that both Trp442 and Trp473 are accessible to solvent.
The fluorescence studies of the VP16 AAD described here showed that this domain was highly flexible and mobile, suggesting that it is poorly structured.
To obtain unique intrinsic fluorescence probes at key positions within the VP16 AAD, Trp mutations were introduced at either position 442 or 473.
These small values, in the range of 0.059-0.079, suggest that probes at either position were associated with fast segmental motion as seen in the flexible polypeptide adrenocorticotropin, where rss = 0.06(50).

Out of the 1,291 residues in cytochrome bo3 ubiquinol oxidase we could assign the sequence for 967 residues (subunit I, 52–81, 96–179, 186–488, 490–520 and 541–552; subunit II, 36–112 and 125–283; subunit III, 19–51, 66–124 and 134–203; subunit IV, 1–109).

 In summary, these results indicated that βN-(1–62) does not exhibit a well defined structure in solution, but rather behaves like a flexible peptide showing only transient formation of local structures.

As shown in Fig. 1 B, βN-(1–62) induced rapid inactivation of these channels when present at 50 μm on the cytoplasmic side of the patch; the time-course of inactivation depended on the peptide concentration (not shown).
Wash-off of βN-(1–62), which should reflect unbinding of the peptide from the receptor, exhibited a time constant of ≈100 ms (99.9 ± 16.8 ms, n = 3) and could be well fitted with a monoexponential (Fig. 2 B, right). This indicated that interaction between βN-(1–62) and its receptor on the α-subunit is a first order reaction, with on and off rates (k on, k off) calculated as 1.7 × 106 mol−1 s−1 and 10.3 s−1 (Fig. 2 C).
The highly convoluted spectrum clearly showed there were different charge states of mainly four fragments, all beginning at position Q85 and terminating at R199, R203, K205, and K207.
Thus, we conclude position R84 was more accessible to protease than the uncut sites.
Our proteolysis data show long regions of either disorder or flexibility in xXPA, thereby providing an opportunity to evaluate the reliability of PONDR, a neural network predictor originally developed from literature searches of intrinsically ordered and disordered regions in proteins (Romero et al. 1997; Li et al. 1999).

From residue 33 to residue 50 of tyrosine hydroxylase, the sequence is RFIGRRQSLIEDARKERE. All of the observed cleavage sites are within this region, occurring after arginines 33, 37, 38, and 49.
When combined with the kinetics of digestion, the sequencing results establish that the conformation of the region from residue 33 to residue 50 in tyrosine hydroxylase is sensitive to the phosphorylation state and to dopamine binding. Phosphorylation of serine 40 by protein kinase A renders this region more susceptible to proteolysis, consistent with a more exposed conformation, whereas this region becomes less accessible when dopamine is bound.

The backbone resonances of the N-terminal 70 residues of RDTyrH could be assigned using sensitivity-enhanced TROSY-based HNCACB, HN(CO)CACB, HNCA and HN(CO)CA triple-resonance experiments,22; 23 with the exception of the amide resonances of Met1, Pro11, Lys12, Gln39, Ser40, Leu41, and Pro68.
This indicated that RDTyrH is composed of a largely unstructured N-terminal region (residues 1-72) and a more ordered and well-folded C-terminal portion (residues 73-159).
There are two highly flexible loop regions, L2 (residues 85-96) and L4 (residues 119-130).
There are two highly flexible loop regions, L2 (residues 85-96) and L4 (residues 119-130).
TyrH is phosphorylated at Ser40 by protein kinase A.
The backbone assignments of phosphorylated RDTyrH could be made using the same methods as for RDTyrH; these included Ser40 and the adjacent Gln39 and Leu41. All the assigned residues retain the same chemical shifts as in RDTyrH except for Gly36, Arg37, Gln39, Ser40, Leu41, Ile42, and Glu43. This suggests that after phosphorylation the core structure of RDTyrH remains the same as that in unphosphorylated RDTyrH, and a local structural change takes place around Ser40.
The most N-terminal peptides, illustrated in Figure 2A by residues 28-34, exhibit complete exchange after only 7 s, the earliest time point used here. This suggests that the very N-terminus of the protein is highly dynamic.
The three peptides covering residues 28-71 of the regulatory domain exhibit complete exchange in less than 7 s, illustrating that this portion of the protein is highly mobile.
Three peptides (35-41, 42-71, 295-299) show dramatic decreases in the rates of deuterium incorporation when dopamine is bound (Figure 4). The first two fragments are on the regulatory domain and show complete exchange within 7 s in the absence of dopamine.
This is consistent with increased flexibility at of the side chains at positions 14 and 34, with the largest effect on the residue closer to the phosphorylation site.
A second loop comprising residues 179-193 was disordered in the T.acidophilum structure; tryptic cleavage of the corresponding loop in the E.coli LplA under non-denaturing conditions rendered the enzyme catalytically inactive, emphasizing its importance.

The CD spectrum of both peptides in H2O was dominated by the contribution of the random coil. The mean residue molar ellipticity at 222 nm ([θ]222), taken as criterion of helix formation, was negligible in water. However, the small positive peak at 215 nm, characteristic of the random coil, was not observed, suggesting that a small amount of structure could be present in water (Fig.1).
Addition of TFE, which stabilizes peptide secondary structure, increased the negative ellipticity at 222 nm. The helical content of the peptides as a function of TFE concentration was estimated by the method of Chen et al.(18). NH-2 had a higher helical propensity than NH-1. In 90% TFE solution, the helical populations were estimated to be 17% for NH-1 and 29% for NH-2 (Fig. 1).
In NH-1, the region spanning from Lys11 to Lys19 adopts a well defined α-helical structure. In NH-2, the α-helical conformation spans from Lys11 to Asp23, with His24 as Ccap. His24presents an αN(i, i + 4) cross-correlation with Lys20, but its torsion φ (−31.7 ± 1.9) indicates that the α carbon departs slightly from the helix cylinder, whereas torsion ψ is proper of an extended configuration (ψ = +95.3 ± 0.1).
The NMR analysis in 90% TFE confirmed the higher helical propensity of NH-2, as shown by more abundant nonsequential (i,i + 3) and (i, i + 4) connectivities in NH-2 than in NH-1. In NH-1, a stretch of αN(i, i + 3) connectivities spanned the basic cluster between Lys11 and Lys20. 
In aqueous (D2O) solution, the amide I′ of both NH-1 and NH-2 was dominated by the random coil band at 1641 cm−1(representing 42% of the total amide I′ intensity in NH-1 and 44% in NH-2) (30).
The helical population increased considerably in TFE solution, both in NH-1 and NH-2. In NH-1, the α-helix amounted to 22% of the total amide I′ intensity, whereas, in NH-2, it amounted to 30%. 
As the percentage of α-helix in aqueous solution was only 6–8%, these results indicate that interaction with the DNA stabilizes the helical structure of the peptides. The amounts of helical structure observed in the complexes with the DNA are similar to those observed in TFE solution, by both IR and CD.

Residues 38–63 as well as the 14 amino acid fusion peptide that had been cloned to the N-terminus of the protein for affinity purification are not visible in the electron density map and are mobile or disordered.
Their entirely disordered segment I175–Q209 may act as a bait and/or an adaptor to substrate molecules and promote binding.

The quantitative NOE data for full-length sp6-(1–52) allow the definition of two α-helical structured regions extending from Ser-14 to Gly-18 and from Lys-33 to Ser-43 (Fig. 8, A and B, respectively), connected by a more flexible region that allows orientational freedom of the two helices.

The final model includes residues 3 to 383 of DnaK (except residues 184 and 210 to 213, which are disordered) and residues 34 to 197 (except residues 108 to 115) for the GrpE monomer that is proximal to DnaK in the complex, and residues 38 to 195 (except residues 108 to 115) for the GrpE monomer that is distal to DnaK, 28 water molecules, and 8 uranyl acetate ions, modeled as single sites.

ΔN2445P, a form which is homogenously phosphorylated by CaMKII, contains five specific phosphoserines in the serine-rich region (SRR, residues 244 to 300) (Fig. 1C) and appears to undergo the same structural transition upon DNA binding as do unmodified ΔN244 (fig. S1E) and other Ets-1 species (3, 7, 11).
The phosphorylated SRR was found to be predominantly unstructured and highly flexible. Based on main-chain 1H and 13C chemical shifts, NMR spectra revealed no predominant secondary structure within this region (17) (Fig. 2A), and the amide hydrogen exchange (HX) rates were comparable to those of a random coil polypeptide (Fig. 2B).

In contrast, residues 31–34, 36–37, 43–45, and 47–49 at the N terminus and 135–138 at the C terminus of Ets-1(29–138) are motionally disordered on a nano- to picosecond time scale as evident by NOEs < 0.5.
The N and C termini of the molecule (residues 29–49 and 135–138) are disordered as evidenced by both high structural rms deviations and 15N NMR relaxation data.
The region of Ets-1(29–138) that precedes helix H1 is disordered.
As shown in Fig. ​Fig.22D, the chemical shift perturbations caused by the modifications were highly localized to the amino acids immediately adjacent to Leu-36 and Thr-38. Thus, within the context of Ets-1(29–138), phosphorylation of Thr-38 does not significantly perturb the disordered character of the MAP kinase substrate site or its adjacent amino acids, nor alter the structure or oligomerization state of the PNT domain.

The CD (circular dichroism) spectra in the far-UV show a strong minimum at 198 nm in the native state which indicates a largely random conformation.
The fact that high GdmCI concentrations, as well as high temperatures lead to significant changes in the far-UV CD suggests an order-disorder transition: in 7 M  GdmCI, the amplitude at 229 nm is decreased, whereas the dichroic absorption at wavelengths< 210 nm seems to indicate further randomization (Figure5C). GdmCI and temperature-dependent denaturation of Dsp16 were monitored by both fluorescence emission at 302 nm and circular dichroism at 222 nm. Both equilibrium transitions yield non-cooperative changes which do not level off to reach a plateau value, even at 7 M GdmCI or 105°C (data not shown). The lack of cooperativity in the structural transitions points to a molten globule-like structure rather than to a defined conformation for the protein.
1H-NMR(nuclear magnetic resonance) spectra in aqueous solution are characterized by a small chemical shift dispersion typical for an unfolded protein; however, the observed line-widths are not typical  for a highly mobile random coil structure.
In order to get some deeper insight into the structure, one-dimensional 1H-NMR spectra were recorded under different conditions (pH 2.3, 4.4 and 6.6, 0 and 100 mM KCI, 10 °C and 35 °C. They were typical for a predominantly non-folded protein.
Assuming that essentially all amide Hα cross peaks are visible in the spectrum, the frequency distribution suggests the protein to be essentially unstructured.
As a consequence of its loose structure, Dsp16 is extremely sensitive towards proteolysis unless its structure is stabilized by structure-making additives such as trifluoroethanol.
At 20 °C, the protein undergoes slow proteolytic degradation in the course of the equilibration.
The evolutionarily conserved SNARE (SNAP receptor) proteins and their complexes are key players in the docking and fusion of secretory vesicles with their target membrane. Biophysical techniques were used to characterize structural and energetic properties of the cytoplasmic domains of the yeast SNAREs Snc1 and Sso1, of the SNAP-25-like domain of Sec9, and of the Sso1:Sec9 and Sso1:Sec9:Snc1 complexes. Individually, all three SNAREs are monomeric; Sso1 shows significant secondary structure while Snc1 and Sec9 are largely unstructured. Ternary SNARE complex formation (KD <50 nM) is accompanied by a more than two-fold increase in secondary structure. This binding induced structure, the large increase in thermal stability, and the self-association of the ternary complex represent conserved properties of SNAREs that are probably important in vesicle docking and fusion.

Individual SNAREs and the Sso1:Sec9c complex are monomeric; the Sso1:Sec9c:Snc1 complex self‐associates.
The individual SNAREs, the Sso1:Sec9c complex, and the Sso1:Sec9c:Snc1 complex are all well‐defined entities (Figs. 1 and 2) that can be isolated chromatographically. CD spectroscopy can therefore be used to investigate possible structural changes that may accompany binding events.
The spectra for Sec9c and Snc1 are very similar to each other and are suggestive of largely random coil conformation. The unstructured state of Sec9c and Snc1 was recently confirmed by ongoing NMR studies (Fiebig et al., unpublished).
Fig. 4 (right panel) shows the CD spectrum recorded from the purified ternary complex. It too shows a significant α‐helical signal, in large excess of that expected from computing the theoretical non‐interacting CD spectrum from spectra of the three individual proteins, or from the observed Sso1:Sec9c complex spectrum and that of Snc1. Again, this increase in mean residue ellipticity could result from increases in any of the individual protein's secondary structure content although most of the changes are likely to occur in Sec9c and in Snc1. The high mean residue ellipticity observed for the ternary complex suggests a large α‐helical content.

Increase in tryptophan fluorescence upon formation of the Sso1:Sec9c:Snc1 complex.
There is a single tryptophan in the Sso1:Sec9c:Snc1 complex, at position 86 in Snc1 which is close to (within ten residues) its putative transmembrane domain. Fig. 6 shows the result of titrating Snc1 with increasing amounts of binary complex. Formation of the ternary complex causes a significant increase in fluorescence intensity. The increase in fluorescence is saturable and up to saturation is linear with concentration. This behavior could be explained by tight binding and by structural re‐arrangements in the vicinity of the tryptophan residue.

As a first step towards characterizing the energetics of SNARE assembly, we have measured thermal denaturation profiles of Sso1, the Sso1:Sec9c complex, and the Sso1:Sec9c:Snc1 complex. Fig. 5 (left panel) shows the thermal denaturation profiles for Sso1 and the binary Sso1:Sec9c complex, and Fig. 5 (right panel) shows the thermal denaturation profiles for Sso1 and the ternary Sso1:Sec9c:Snc1 complex. Sso1 melts with a single transition with a T m of about 48°C. The Sso1:Sec9c complex also unfolds in a single transition with a T m of about 50°C. The melting profile of the ternary complex is more complicated, but it shows a cooperative transition at about 71°C.

Neither the 3,5 (6.70-6.90 ppm) nor the 2.6 (7.00-7.24 ppm) resonances of the four Tyr residues in apo BGP were equivalent, indicating that the apoprotein had some tertiary structure (Figure 1A).
These results showed that dog osteocalcin undergoes a major conformational change when it associates with calcium and that its calcium affinity is relatively strong (Kd < 10-4 M).

We thus conclude that the M4−K22 segment forms a unique helix.
The NMR spectrum of purified chromogranin A in D2O at pH 6.05 shown in Fig. 7(a) is in general closely similar to that computed for an extended random coil by the method of MACDONALD & PHILLIPS (1969) shown in Fig. 7(c).
The CD spectra showed that the magnitude of molar ellipticity at 222 nm increased as the pH was changed from 7.5 to 5.5. The increase in the magnitude of the molar ellipticity in the region from -207 to -225 nm indicates an increase of a-helicity at pH 5.5, while the decrease in the magnitude of molar ellipticity at -200 nm indicates a  decrease of coil structure as the pH changed from 7.5 to 5.5 [13-15].

Therefore, the increased binding of bis-ANS is probably due to a Ca2+-induced conformational change in CGA rather than a mere charge neutralization of bis-ANS by Ca2+.

The nature of the Ca2+-induced conformational changes of CGA was studied by circular dichroism in the presence and absence of Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 2, the CD spectrum of CGA at pH 5.5 was significantly changed in the presence of 15 mM Ca2+.

As shown in Fig. 1A, chromogranin A was proteolyzed into small fragments by trypsin at pH 5.5.
A with a  size of -60 kDa remained relatively intact at pH 7.5 whereas the same fragment was proteolyzed continuously by trypsin at pH 5.5, suggesting that the N-terminal core structure is more compact and better protected at pH 7.5. 
Since the PRG CD spectrum differed from the poly-L-proline II helical structure and did not respond to CaCl1, the implication was that the proline present in PRG exists in a disordered state (i.e. a mixture of cis and/ or trans isomers).
These data imply that all of the lysine residues in Dns-PRG are exposed to solvent in the native form.
CaD is thought to contribute to a thin‐filament‐linked regulation of smooth muscle contraction through its specific binding to F‐actin and F‐actin‐tropomyosin with a concomitant inhibition of the actin‐stimulated myosin ATPase. The reversal of the CaD action is made possible by its additional interaction with calcium‐dependent proteins such as calmodulin (CaM) and caltropin.
The functional activity of CaD is regulated by phosphorylation performed by a number of protein kinases6 and by calcium via Ca2+‐binding proteins, with CaD being alternatively bound either to F‐actin or CaM, depending upon the calcium concentration (so‐called “flip‐flop” binding). This thin filament‐based modulatory effect is assumed to provide additional “fine‐tuning” to the well‐established, myosin light‐chain phosphorylation‐dependent, thick filament‐based regulation of smooth muscle contraction. The CaD regulatory role is further reinforced by the localization of the protein almost exclusively within the contractile domain of the smooth muscle cells.
This spectrum was calculated assuming that both proteins are completely involved into the complex formation and a difference between the measured CaD136‐CaM and CaM spectra are due to the partial folding of CaD136 rather than a partial unfolding of CaM; i.e., as [(CaD136‐CaM − 0.5 ÷ CaM)/0.5].
Figure 7 shows that the formation of CaD136–CaM complex led to a partial folding of the natively unfolded CaD136. As it was already pointed out, in the absence of CaM CaD136 possesses a far‐UV CD spectrum typical of an essentially unfolded polypeptide chain; i.e., a spectrum with an intense minimum in the vicinity of 200 nm, and the absence of characteristic bands in the 210–230 nm region. However, as the CaD136–CaM complex was formed, the minimum at 200 nm became less intense and shifted toward the longer wavelength, whereas the negative intensity of the spectrum around 222 nm increased, reflecting the formation of ordered secondary structure. Importantly, the extent of this folding was relatively low and CaD136 remained substantially unstructured even after the effective binding to CaM. Potentially, there is an alternative scenario of CaD136 binding to CaM, where CaD136 gains some sort of rigid but nonregular structure as a result of complex formation.
To obtain information about the hydrodynamic dimensions of CaD136, the gel‐filtration behavior of this protein at neutral pH in the absence or in the presence of 6 M GdmCl was studied. Chromatographic analysis confirmed the results of other techniques and showed that CaD136 was essentially unfolded under the conditions of neutral pH. In fact, we have established that the hydrodynamic dimensions of CaD136 are relatively close to those measured in the presence of 6 M GdmCl (RS = 28.1 ± 0.8 and 35.3 ± 0.8 Å, respectively), confirming the fact that CaD136 is essentially unfolded even in the absence of denaturant.
We are showing in this article that the functionally important C‐terminal domain of CaD, CaD136, is an intrinsically unstructured. In fact, it shows large hydrodynamic dimensions (gel‐filtration and SAXS), does not have cooperatively melted tertiary structure (DSC), possesses absence of globular structure (SAXS), and is characterized by low content of ordered secondary structure (far‐UV CD).

Figure 5(A) represents the results of Guinier analysis of the scattering data for CaD136. The linear Guinier plot indicates that the solution of this protein was homogeneous. The radius of gyration of a random coil, Rurn:x-wiley:08873585:media:PROT10481:tex2gif-stack-6, may be estimated from the corresponding Stokes radius, Rurn:x-wiley:08873585:media:PROT10481:tex2gif-stack-7, using the relation Rurn:x-wiley:08873585:media:PROT10481:tex2gif-stack-8/Rurn:x-wiley:08873585:media:PROT10481:tex2gif-stack-9 = 1.51.45 The observed Rg value for CaD136 (40.8 ± 0.8 Å) is smaller than that estimated for a random coil conformation for a protein of this size (51.9 Å), indicating that the natively unfolded conformation of this protein is in fact more compact than that of a random coil. Finally, analysis of the X‐ray scattering data in a form of the Kratky plot shows that CaD136 does not have any well‐developed globular structure [Fig. 5(B)].

The reversal of the CaD action is made possible by its additional interaction with calcium‐dependent proteins such as calmodulin (CaM) and caltropin.
The functional activity of CaD is regulated by phosphorylation performed by a number of protein kinases6 and by calcium via Ca2+‐binding proteins, with CaD being alternatively bound either to F‐actin or CaM, depending upon the calcium concentration (so‐called “flip‐flop” binding). This thin filament‐based modulatory effect is assumed to provide additional “fine‐tuning” to the well‐established, myosin light‐chain phosphorylation‐dependent, thick filament‐based regulation of smooth muscle contraction. The CaD regulatory role is further reinforced by the localization of the protein almost exclusively within the contractile domain of the smooth muscle cells.
The effect of temperature on CaD136 structure was further analyzed by DSC. We have established that CaD136 is characterized by the absence of distinct heat sorption peaks within the temperature region from 10°C to 110°C, indicative of the absence of rigid tertiary structure for the protein.
We are showing in this article that the functionally important C‐terminal domain of CaD, CaD136, is an intrinsically unstructured. In fact, it shows large hydrodynamic dimensions (gel‐filtration and SAXS), does not have cooperatively melted tertiary structure (DSC), possesses absence of globular structure (SAXS), and is characterized by low content of ordered secondary structure (far‐UV CD).
Figure 2 represents tryptophan fluorescence spectra of CD136. It is clearly seen that the spectrum of free CaD136 has maximum at about 350.2 nm; i.e., it is close to that of tryptophan in water (351.5 nm). This indicates that the CaD136 tryptophan residues are almost totally exposed to water. 
Chicken gizzard CaD contains five tryptophan residues per protein molecule; three of them, Trp674, Trp707, and Trp737, are located within the CaD136 domain. On the other hand, CaM does not have any Trp residues. This implies changes in the CaD136 intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence as fast and easy method to detect CaD‐CaM complex formation.
Figure 2 compares the tryptophan fluorescence spectra (excitation at 296.7 nm) of CaD136 measured in the absence or presence of CaM. Notably, excess of Ca2+ (5 mM CaCl2) was used to saturate CaM by calcium, which is a necessary condition of effective binding of CaM by CaD.11 The temperature was kept at 20°C in order to distance from thermal transition of Ca2+‐loaded CaM. It can be seen that CaM binding to CaD136 led to the considerable (1.9‐fold) increase in the fluorescence quantum yield and an essential (17 nm) blue shift of the CaD136 fluorescence spectrum, reflecting the transfer of tryptophans into the less mobile and polar environment.
This most likely reflects some CaM‐induced compaction of a polypeptide chain at least in the vicinity of tryptophans or these changes in fluorescence are due to the insertion of Trp into a hydrophobic binding pocket on the CaM. These observations have been used to evaluate the binding parameters of CaD136‐CaM complex (see Fig. 6). It should be noted that the characteristic bend of the CaM‐titration curve in Figure 6, corresponding to saturation of CaD136 by CaM, takes place around CaM to CaD136 ratio about 1, which is an evidence of the binding of a single CaM molecule per CaD136 molecule
Importantly, our data suggest that the formation of the tight CaD136–CaM complex (Kd = 1.4 ± 0.2 μM) leads only to the marginal folding of the natively unfolded CaD136. These facts might shed some light on the mechanism of CaD and CaM interaction. 
Accordingly, we are showing that CaD136 folds to a partially folded conformation as a result of its interaction with CaM.
Figure 1(A) represents far‐UV CD spectra of CaD136 measured at different temperatures. At low temperature this protein is characterized by a far‐UV CD spectrum typical of an essentially unfolded polypeptide chain. On the other hand, more detailed analysis of far UV CD spectrum shows that CaD136, being considerably distorted, is still far from to be completely unfolded and preserves some residual structure [e.g., [θ]222 ∼ −2500° cm2 dmol−1, the minimum is located at 200, rather than at 196–198 nm; see Fig. 1(A)].
It has been noted that such structure forming effect of heating, being typical of the intrinsically unstructured proteins, might be ascribed to the heat‐induced intensification of the hydrophobic interactions.
As it was already pointed out, in the absence of CaM CaD136 possesses a far‐UV CD spectrum typical of an essentially unfolded polypeptide chain; i.e., a spectrum with an intense minimum in the vicinity of 200 nm, and the absence of characteristic bands in the 210–230 nm region.
We are showing in this article that the functionally important C‐terminal domain of CaD, CaD136, is an intrinsically unstructured. In fact, it shows large hydrodynamic dimensions (gel‐filtration and SAXS), does not have cooperatively melted tertiary structure (DSC), possesses absence of globular structure (SAXS), and is characterized by low content of ordered secondary structure (far‐UV CD).
Moreover, our data are consistent with the conclusion that CaD136 is not completely unfolded, belonging to the subclass of the native premolten globules, according to its hydrodynamic properties and far‐UV CD spectrum.

Importantly, large portion of binding sites being localized within the C‐terminal domain of CaD, which can interact with actin, Ca2+‐binding proteins, myosin, tropomyosin and phospholipids.
In the absence of TFE, the initial shallow negative CD curve with a minimum at ca. 200 nm and a very small negative ellipticity value at 220 nm was characteristic of a disordered peptide conformation with very little evidence of stable secondary structure (Figure 1).
 Addition of TFE caused a pronounced shift in the initial minimum to 206 nm, and simultaneously a second substantial negative ellipticity developed at ca. 220 nm and a positive band at 190 nm, that were indicative of an increasing content of stable α-helical secondary structure.
In the present study, we analyzed the solution structure of a synthetic 38 amino acid peptide comprising the entire CD4CYTO domain (R396 to I433) by multidimensional 1H NMR and circular dichroism spectroscopy. We found that upon addition of trifluoroethanol the molecule assumes an amphipathic α-helix that is centered between Gln-403 and Ser-415.

Our CD analysis indicates that CD4CYTO adopts a stable secondary structure only when a membrane-like environment was present.
The absence of any long-range NOE's implies that CD4CYTO assumes a linear structure with an α-helix centered toward the N-terminus, a short flexible N-terminus, and a longer nonstructured C-terminus.

Nearly complete resonance assignment of DPC micelle-inserted CD4mut has been reported earlier [32]. Secondary chemical shift analysis predicted a transmembrane α-helix from 372 to 395 and a short α-helix from residue 407 to 412.

The spectra for Sec9c and Snc1 are very similar to each other and are suggestive of largely random coil conformation.

The C-terminal region is missing from the crystal structure.
Fig. 1 shows the 270-MHz 1H NMR spectrum of calsequestrin in the calcium-free form. The spectrum is characteristic of a protein known to be largely in the random coil conformation in the apo form (5, 7, 8, 10), in the sense that there is no dispersion of chemical shifts of the resonances of any of the amino acids from their random coil positions in the spectrum and the resonances are relatively narrow for a protein of this size (Mr = 44,000).
The addition of KCl to calsequestrin (Fig. 3) resulted in the broadening and concomitant loss of intensity of resonances throughout both the aromatic and
aliphatic regions of the spectrum. This broadening was dependent on the concentration of KCl and there was no evidence of any selective changes in the NMR spectrum (Fig. 3, A and B). This is consistent with K+ binding to several sites on the extended structure of calsequestrin (7).
The addition of CaCl2 to calsequestrin (Fig. 4) had the same general effect as KCI; that is, a broadening of the resonances and loss of intensities throughout the NMR spectrum.
Unlike the KCl titration curve (Figs. 3 and 6), which showed binding to a single class of independent sites, the calcium titration curve showed a flatter region at the initial stages of the titration (Fig. 4C, curves a and b). This type of curve indicates the presence of some positive cooperativity for the binding of calcium to calsequestrin (10).

The CD spectrum obtained for calsequestrin in this study (Fig. 5A) is similar to the published CD spectra of this protein (8, 10) which indicate that the calcium-free protein is predominantly in the random coil form.
The addition of calcium to the protein results in an increase in the a-helix content (8-10) to 35% in the calcium-saturated form (Fig. 5, A and B). The shape of the calcium titration curve obtained from the CD experiments (Fig. 5B) is very similar to that obtained from the NMR studies (Fig. 4C, curves a and b), with a region at the low calcium concentrations which is indicative of positive cooperativity.

The CD spectrum o fPNT at neutral pH lacks evidence of any significant ordered secondary structure, as seen from its large negative ellipticity at 198 nm and nil ellipticity at 185 nm (Fig. 4).

On the other hand, the hypothesis of an unfolded protein is consistent with the CD  and  NMR  data,  which  show  that  PNT  lacks  stable secondary structure.
Moreover,CD studies further confirm that PNT is unfolded in aqueous solution.
The very small spread of the resonance  frequencies for amide protons (between 7.8 and 8.7 ppm,see box in Fig. 3) together with the absence of NOEs in the  amide–amide  region  is  typical  of a  protein  without any  constant  secondary  structure.
NMR  data show that PNT exhibits no short-range interactions, indicating the lack of any constant secondary structure as well as the absence of any stable oligomers.
On the other hand, the hypothesis of an unfolded protein is consistent with the CD  and  NMR  data,  which  show  that  PNT  lacks  stable secondary structure.
As shown in Fig. 2, PNT displays an abnormally  slow  migration  in  SDS–PAGE  with  an  apparentmolecular  weight  (MW)  o  f33  kDa  (expected  weight  25kDa). This abnormal behavior has been reported previously for all P proteins of Morbilliviruses and Paramyxoviruses (Lamb and Kolakofsky, 2001) and attributed to the occurrence of acidic stretches in PNT, which is consistent with our result.
 In the absence of TFE, PNT is entirely digested in 6 h, wherea sit shows resistance to digestion in the presence of 15% TFE (compare lanes C and 4).
 The minimal peptide required to form the complex was identified using NMR spectroscopy as P1‐50 (Figure S2), resulting in a high‐yielding, soluble, and stable N0P complex. 
P50 is bound to N so that peaks are too weak to be observed
The coiled coil is too large to be observed by standard solution NMR analysis because of the effective rotational correlation time, and only the flexible residues give rise to sharp signals. By this method, all amino acids up to residue 300 could be identified, proving the absence of the additional helices that were observed in the Sendai virus domain.
PNT-GFP exhibited a thin and flexible tail-like structure with a temporarily appearing and disappearing small globule at the N-terminal end, together with the C-terminal GFP (Fig. 4e and Supplementary Video 7).
The R2D histogram of the IDR was best fitted to a double Gaussian with peaks at 8.9 ± 0.33 and 14.3 ± 9.26 nm (Fig. 4i). The mean height of the IDR was 0.4–0.5 nm, in both metastable shorter and longer states (Extended Data Fig. 5b), indicating that the IDR is fully disordered even on disorder-to-order transition of the small globule.
The minimal peptide required to form the complex was identified using NMR spectroscopy as P1‐50 (Figure S2), resulting in a high‐yielding, soluble, and stable N0P complex.
Thus, the Rso fPNT measured by DLS corresponds to the value expected for a fully unfolded protein.
Therefore, the Stokes radius measured for PNT (41 Å) is not compatible with a monomeric, globular protein. Such a large value for the Stokes radius could be attributed either to a high degree of multimerization  or  to  a  monomeric,  unfolded  protein (RsU predicted: 46 Å). Multimers in the form of nonspecific aggregates would have led to a broad peak in gel filtration, which is not the case here. 
The  hydrodynamic  properties  of  PNT  inferred  from both  gel  filtration  and  dynamic  light-scattering  experiments  are  consistent  with  PNT  being  either  a  stableoligomer  or  a  monomeric,  unfolded  protein. 
We used NMR spectroscopy to investigate the conformational behavior of MeV PNTD in its free state and to describe the structural, dynamic, and kinetic behavior of this highly disordered 90-kDa complex. Although unfolded, PNTD exhibits transient helical propensities in the N-terminal N binding site (α1/2), around residues 87 to 93 (α3) and 189 to 198 (α4), linked by long, highly dynamic segments (Fig. 1).
Carbon chemical shifts of P304–507 did not change significantly in comparison with PLOOP, demonstrating that PLOOP remains disordered in the context of the construct that links the tetramerization domain and XD and that is required for phase separation (see fig. S6).
Several mixtures formed condensed phases: P50N525 + P1–507, P304N525 + P304–507, and P50N525 + P304–507 (Fig. 1B). P50N525 + P304–507 was thus identified as the minimal phase-separating system, forming spherical bimolecular condensates as measured by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1B) and showing increased turbidity (Fig. 1D).
Both proteins therefore remain liquid in the condensed phase, although their rotational dynamics are slowed, possibly due to increased viscosity in the droplets. In summary, these results confirm that LLPS occurs under near-physiological protein and salt concentrations upon mixing of full-length N- and the C-terminal domains of P in vitro, complementing recent in vivo observations (32).
An additional interaction between PLOOP and N was identified using NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that the role of this domain, which is present in all constructs involved in phase separation, involves a direct interaction with N rather than acting as a simple spacer (35).

(C) DIC and fluorescent images of FMRP, FMRPΔLCR, and FMRPLCR protein (50 μM) mixed with Cy3-labeled sc1 RNA (5 μM) in 25 mM Na2PO4, pH 7.4, 30 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT. Images show that only FMRP and FMRPLCR form droplets with sc1 RNA. (Scale bar, 10 μm.)
Upon addition of Cy3-labeled sc1 RNA, droplets were formed with FMRP and FMRPLCR, but not with FMRPΔLCR (Fig. 1C). Our results show that FMRPLCR alone is necessary and sufficient to drive phase separation with sc1 RNA in vitro.
Overlay of 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectra of the protein-depleted (i.e., monomeric) and condensed phases shows almost identical chemical shifts with narrow amide proton dispersion (∼8.0–8.7 ppm), reflecting similar global disordered character (SI Appendix, Fig. S3B).
In contrast, our solution NMR data show FMRPLCR to be primarily structurally disordered in the condensed phase.
To address these questions, we first reconstituted a model biomolecular condensate containing the intrinsically disordered C-terminal regions of FMRP (445–632, hereafter referred to as FMRP) and CAPRIN1 (607–709, hereafter referred to as CAPRIN1) for biophysical studies (Fig. 1A). 
Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we detected no FMRP-CAPRIN1 interaction; however, after in vitro phosphorylation of FMRP (pFMRP; fig. S3, A and B) by casein kinase II (CK2), a known kinase that Ser/Thr-phosphorylates FMRP in vivo (22, 23), we observed an effective 1 μM CAPRIN1-pFMRP binding affinity (fig. S4, A and B).
To address these questions, we first reconstituted a model biomolecular condensate containing the intrinsically disordered C-terminal regions of FMRP (445–632, hereafter referred to as FMRP) and CAPRIN1 (607–709, hereafter referred to as CAPRIN1) for biophysical studies (Fig. 1A). 
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments between highly phosphorylated Cy3-labeled pFMRP and Cy5-labeled CAPRIN1 yielded an apparent 6 μM binding affinity, with decreasing affinities corresponding to lower numbers of phosphate groups on pFMRP (Fig. 1B and fig. S3).
To address these questions, we first reconstituted a model biomolecular condensate containing the intrinsically disordered C-terminal regions of FMRP (445–632, hereafter referred to as FMRP) and CAPRIN1 (607–709, hereafter referred to as CAPRIN1) for biophysical studies (Fig. 1A). 
Using fluorescence microscopy, we observed that CAPRIN1 does not co–phase-separate with FMRP (fig. S4, C to E) even at protein concentrations of 1 mM, but does so with pFMRP over a wide range of concentrations (Fig. 1, C and D, and fig. S4D).
To identify residues mediating pFMRP-CAPRIN1 interactions, we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and assigned the CAPRIN1 resonances (fig. S5). Titrating pFMRP into [15N]CAPRIN1 resulted in co–phase separation, forming a turbid mixture containing many small droplets. Our results show global decreases in [15N]CAPRIN1 amide peak intensities with no sizable chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) (fig. S6).
RNA-bound peptide (Fig. 1c) revealed a transition from a ‘random coil’ to a well-ordered conformation of the peptide upon RNA binding. 
Although a solid evidence for the formation of β-turns in the unbound RGG box is missing, our structural data clearly shows feasibility of the turn formation in the RGG motif.
Yeast heat shock transcription factor N-terminal activation domains are unstructured as probed by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy.
Using the DNA-binding domain as a structural reference, we show that the protein backbone of the N-terminal activation domain undergoes rapid, large-amplitude motions and is therefore unstructured. Difference CD data also show that the N-terminal activation domain remains random-coil, even in the presence of DNA.
In addition, we used two-dimensional heteronuclear 15N{1h} NOE NMR and measurements of 15N relaxation parameters to show that the N-terminal activation domains from both yeast strains have a high degree of flexibility, which is consistent with an unstructured state in solution. The results are particularly compelling because they offer the first positive evidence for a dynamically disordered transcriptional activation domain.
N-terminal activation domain of yeast HSF is unstructured
The remaining signals, attributable to the N-terminal activation domain, all had negative NOEs indicative of rapid, large-amplitude motions. This shows that the N-terminal activation domain of S. cerevisiae also behaves as an unstructured protein.
To confirm that the N-terminal activation domains were not unstructured because of denaturation at low pH, further NMR spectroscopic studies were performed at pH 5.75 (data not shown). Comparison of the chemical shift distribution in spectra acquired at higher pH with those at lower pH indicated no change in the structural state of the constructs. The DNA- binding domains remained folded, whereas the activation do- mains persisted in an unstructured state.
Yeast heat shock transcription factor contains a flexible linker between the DNA-binding and trimerization domains
The Proposed Linker Region Has No Ordered Secondary Structure-To look directly at the secondary structure of the linker, the CD spectra of the DNA-binding domain (S. cerevisiae residues 171-259) and the trimerization domain (S. cerevisiae residues 333-424) were subtracted from each of the CD spectra of the HSF derivatives. As shown in Fig. 4 B , it is apparent that the difference CD spectrum representing the linker region of Sc-DT(21L) is characteristic of random coil with a minimum at 230 nm and maximum at 220 nm (27).
The molar ellipticity (qprot) of the Sc-DT series of protein were each subtracted by the molar ellipticity of the isolated DNA-binding domain and the molar ellipticity of the isolated trimerization domain. The resulting difference spectra should approximate the spectra of the linker region alone. The difference circular dichroism spectra of Sc-DT(21L) and Sc-D(21L) show that the linker has no ordered secondary structure.

Yeast heat shock transcription factor N-terminal activation domains are unstructured as probed by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy.
Using the DNA-binding domain as a structural reference, we show that the protein backbone of the N-terminal activation domain undergoes rapid, large-amplitude motions and is therefore unstructured. Difference CD data also show that the N-terminal activation domain remains random-coil, even in the presence of DNA.
Deletions of the entire C-terminal region result in a functional HSF at physiological temperatures (Nieto-Sotelo et al., 1990; Sorger, 1990); this implies that the N-terminal activation domain is sufficient for the required constitutive level of transcriptional activity.
In addition, we used two-dimensional heteronuclear 15N{1H} NOE NMR and measurements of 15N relaxation parameters to show that the N-terminal activation domains from both yeast strains have a high degree of flexibility, which is consistent with an unstructured state in solution. The results are particularly compelling because they offer the first positive evidence for a dynamically disordered transcriptional activation domain.
Far-UV CD spectroscopy, performed at pH 7.0, also indicate that the N-terminal activation domains of yeast HSF are unstructured. Figure 5A shows CD spectra for the DNA-binding domain, and for the N-terminal activation domain plus the DNA-binding domain, as well as the difference between the two. The difference spectrum is characteristic of a random coil. We also examined the possibility that the N-terminal activation do- main might behave differently when the DNA-binding domain is bound to a DNA-binding site (Fig. 5B). An examination of this CD difference spectrum indicates that binding of the DNA- binding domain to the DNA does not induce any structural changes in the N-terminal activation domain.
 Without Pi in the solution, only 4.5±0.7% of the protein appeared folded into α-helix and an increase up to 10.5% was observed when the Pi concentration was increased to 50 mM (Fig. 1B).
The presence of 10 mM sodium phosphate (Pi) had a large effect on its CD spectrum (Fig. 1 A). The changes obtained in the presence of Pi are characteristic of a large increase in the α-helicity of H1.
As little as 100 μM ATP produced corresponding effects on the CD spectrum of H1 as 10 mM sodium phosphate (Pi) did (cf. Fig. 1A,C). An increase in the α-helicity of H1 to 10.4±0.5% was obtained at a concentration of 500 μM ATP (Fig. 1D).
Addition of double-stranded poly(dA-dT) or poly(dI-dC) DNA to H1 resulted in an increase in the α-helicity of H1 (Fig. 2B and 3A). It increased from 4.5% up to a maximum of 9.4±0.2% and 8.3±0.6% respectively. Increasing DNA concentrations increased linearly the α-helicity of H1 up to a concentration where the H1-binding sites on the DNA could be estimated to correspond to the amount of H1 (data not shown).

Analysis of the NOE data indicates that hirudin consists of an N-terminal compact domain (residues 1-49) held together by three disulfide linkages and a disordered C-terminal tail (residues 50-65) which does not fold back on the rest of the protein.
This was important as residues 55, 56, 57, and 59 possess virtually degenerate NH chemical shifts under all conditions studied. 
We therefore conclude that there is no evidence that the C-terminus (residues 50-65) has an ordered structure or folds back onto the rest of the protein. The high degree of NH chemical shift degeneracy over a range of temperature and the absence of slowly exchanging amide protons are consistent with a “random-coil” structure for this portion of the molecule
Crystals of thrombin complexed with hirugen and APPA were obtained by soaking an α-thrombin-hirugen crystal in a solution of APPA.
The rest of the hirugen molecule from residue Asp55' to Gln64' is well defined.

In the complex with bovine α-thrombin, hirudin variant 1, whose sequence is shown in Fig. 2, has a compact NH2-terminal domain, comprised of residues 1h through 48h, and an extended COOH-terminal polypeptide chain, comprised of residues 49h through 65h (Figs. 3 and 4).

Of 108 residues, only residues 14–31 of PTHrP were visible in the final electron density map, with residues 14–29 adopting a helical conformation.

The CD spectrum of E. coli L27 (Fig. 3a) indicates that the protein is unstructured.
This inference was reinforced by 2D heteronuclear NMR analysis of a 15N-labeled sample of the E. coli protein, which demonstrated that there was no dispersion of the backbone amide or side-chain amine resonances (data not shown).
The proton-nitrogen (1H,15N) HSQC spectrum of SARA SBD revealed a narrow range of amide proton chemical shifts characteristic of disordered proteins (Fig. 2).
These data provide strong evidence that the unbound SBD is disordered in solution.
Although the full SBD bound with a dissociation constant of 240  30 nM, the affinities for any single element of the SBD were 2500 – 8500-fold lower.
The C-terminal extension in Hsp25 (and those in c-crystallin) therefore have characteristics of many peptides in an aqueous environment, i.e. flexibility and no defined conformation [16].
An important observation was that no additional slowly exchanging protons arising from the (1-12) and (51-72) sequences surrounding the two fingers were observed in the spectrum of NCp7 (Figure 3c), suggesting that the N and C-terminal sequences were less structured than the central (13-51) domain of NCp7. 
The residues 1-12 of the Nucleocapsid protein p7 (NCp7) corresponds to the region  378-389 of the Gag polyprotein.

The COOH-terminal 18 residues that are lacking or disordered in the crystal structures are represented as a shaded string.
The dashed line represents residues 10–26 of syntaxin, which are not visible in the electron density maps.
Syx1a N-peptide residues 10–26 were disordered (dashed line).
Cadherins are single pass transmembrane proteins that mediate Ca(2+)-dependent homophilic cell-cell adhesion by linking the cytoskeletons of adjacent cells. In adherens junctions, the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins bind to beta-catenin, which in turn binds to the actin-associated protein alpha-catenin. 
Our analysis shows that the cadherin cytoplasmic tail is unstructured in isolation but appears to become structured upon binding to β-catenin.
The physical properties of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain and its interactions with beta-catenin have been investigated. Proteolytic sensitivity, tryptophan fluorescence, circular dichroism, and (1)H NMR measurements indicate that murine E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain is unstructured. Upon binding to beta-catenin, the domain becomes resistant to proteolysis, suggesting that it structures upon binding. Cadherin-beta-catenin complex stability is modestly dependent on ionic strength, indicating that, contrary to previous proposals, the interaction is not dominated by electrostatics.

Plakoglobin binds to the full 152-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin (Ecyto) with a dissociation constant KD of 85 nm.
Here, we report structural, biophysical, and biochemical studies aimed at understanding the molecular basis of selective exclusion of β-catenin and α-catenin from desmosomes. The crystal structure of the plakoglobin armadillo domain bound to phosphorylated E-cadherin shows virtually identical interactions to those observed between β-catenin and E-cadherin.

Phosphorylated residues are Ser840, Ser 842 and Ser848.

The fluoresence anisotropy data suggest that the Ecyto and DEcyto domains are unfolded under native conditions.
The cytoplasmic tail is the most highly conserved domain among type I cadherins (34). With a length of ∼150 residues, it is easily large enough to be an independently folded structural unit. We expressed the E- and DE-cadherin cytoplasmic domains in E. coli and purified them to homogeneity. Tryptophan fluorescence, circular dichroism, and one-dimensional proton NMR studies all lead to the same surprising conclusion: rEcyto and rDEcyto are unfolded in solution.

CD spectroscopy was therefore used to probe for the presence regular protein secondary structure. The spectra measured for rEcyto and rDEcyto at 0 °C are essentially identical and feature a single minimum in mean residue ellipticity at ∼202 nm (Fig. 1). This spectrum indicates a lack of secondary structure, which would be expected of an unstructured polypeptide.

It is proposed that binding of cadherins to beta-catenin prevents recognition of degradation signals that are exposed in the unstructured cadherin cytoplasmic domain, favoring a cell surface population of catenin-bound cadherins capable of participating in cell adhesion.

Mixtures of rEcyto or rDEcyto and various β-catenin constructs were incubated for more than 1 h at 4 °C and injected onto an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech HR 10/30 Superdex 200 size exclusion column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, and 1 mmDTT. 
The structure is composed of a single transmembrane helix from residues 10–33, a large dynamic unstructured linker region, and a distorted cytoplasmic helix from residues 61–79 that interacts with the surface of the lipid bilayer.

Another distinguishing feature that separates SNN from the structures of the aforementioned proteins is that the two helical domains of SNN are connected by a rather long unstructured linker.
The P1α CD spectra show features of a virtually unordered protein with some negative ellipticiy around 222 nm which disappears completely when high concentrations of urea are added to the protein (data not shown). This suggests a residual α-helical content even though the protein seems to be mainly random-coil.
In agreement with the previous observations, NMR studies on the intact protein show very little signal dispersion (Figure 4) and very fast amide exchange when protein is incubated in the presence of deuterated water (data not shown).
Incubation of both proteins was followed by far-UV CD and 1D-NMR measurements, and spectra were compared with those of the isolated proteins under the same conditions. The CD spectra of the protein mixture, when compared to the arithmetical addition of spectra from the individual proteins indicate that some secondary structural changes take place upon incubation of both proteins together (Figure 9A).
Protein interactions seems to increase the secondary structure of one or both proteins.

As described above, most of the electron densities associated with the potential actin–tropomyosin interfaces are ambiguous. These include the inhibitory region (residues 137–148) and the C-terminus of TnI (residues 163–210 in Tn52KA and 192–210 in Tn52KB), and the C-TnT (residues 272–288).
Third, the link through TnI, the inhibitory region that connects H2(I) and H3(I), is not well defined in the present structures, indicating that this link is also flexible.

Two-dimensional 1H-NMR parameters (nonsequential nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) and conformational CaH shifts) in 30% TFE permitted to conclude that about 25% of a(404–451) and 40% of b(394–451) form well-defined helices encompassing residues 418–432 and 408–431, respectively, flanked by disordered N- and C-segments.
The 20-amino‐acid stretch between pS233 and pS259 could not be traced, presumably due to its intrinsic disorder and lack of contacts to the 14-3-3ζ protein.
The missing electron density region from PDB:4IHL corresponds to the disordered stretch between pS233 and pS259 described in PMID:22922483
Interestingly, the cterFCP protein is completely disordered in the unbound state, but forms an α-helix (H1'; E945–M961) in the complex.
The free cterFCP protein is devoid of any stable structural element but adopts a 17-residue α-helix (H1') at its carboxyl terminus (E945-M961) on inter- action with cterRAP74 (Fig. 1A).
NMR assignment of the intrinsically disordered C-terminal region of Homo sapiens FCP1 in the unbound state
The acidic C-terminal region of FCP1 is disordered in the free state, but adopts an alpha-helical conformation upon binding to the heavy chain of TFIIF. Here we report (1)H, (13)C, and (15)N resonance assignments for the intrinsically disordered unbound form of human C-terminal FCP1 (residues 879-961).
Interestingly, the cterFCP protein is completely disordered in the unbound state, but forms an α-helix (H1'; E945–M961) in the complex.
The free cterFCP protein is devoid of any stable structural element but adopts a 17-residue α-helix (H1') at its carboxyl terminus (E945-M961) on interaction with cterRAP74 (Fig. 1A). These residues of cterFCP
that are involved in formation of the alpha-helix display significant
changes in amide 1 H and 15 N chemical shifts between the free
state and the complex. Chemical shift index (CSI) analysis of
the H-alpha , C-alpha , C-beta, and C' chemical shifts of cterFCP also supports
the presence of the H1' helix for residues E945–M961 in the
complex, but not in the free form.
The importance of the H1' helix for interaction with cterRAP74 is supported by numerous intermolecular NOEs between the H1' alpha-helix of
cterFCP and cterRAP74
Those amino acids that show intermolecular NOEs are indicated by an asterisk below the residue.
We therefore chose to measure circular dichroism
using both the ctFCP1 construct from the NMR samples and a
shorter synthetic peptide (comprising residues 944–961) in which
the fraction of helical residues should be enriched. The spectra for
the peptide and for ctFCP1 are shown black in Fig. 3A and B, respec-
tively. While both are characteristic of CD spectra for IDPs, they
also feature a subtle minimum near 222 nm – the hallmark of an
alpha-helix.
Consensus analysis of chemical shifts indicates strong enough secondary shifting to assign a helical conformation to residues 945–949, which are found in the
N-terminal portion of the RAP74 binding helix. The analysis indicates that the remainder of ctFCP1 is in a disordered state, although there is signiﬁcant tendency towards helical chemical shifts in many other residues composing the RAP74 binding interface as well.
SMK toxin is a killer toxin produced by a halotolerant yeast, Pichia farinosa. It is a heterodimer consisting of α (63 aa) and β (77 aa) subunits, between which no disulfide bond exists. The two subunits interact tightly with each other below pH 5. However, the subunits dissociate under neutral conditions, resulting in the aggregation of the α subunit and the concomitant loss of killer activity. CD spectral measurements showed that the secondary structure of the SMK toxin changes drastically in the pH range 5.1–5.5 and that after the dissociation of the subunits, the soluble βsubunit alone cannot take any secondary structure.
After removing theαsubunit from the turbid solution at pH 7.0 by centrifugation, the soluble β subunit gives a CD spectrum which is identical with that of a peptide in the random coil (Figure 1). This result clearly indicates that the β subunit cannot take any secondary structure in the absence of the α subunit.
The α and β subunits consist of amino acid residues 19-81 and 146-222, as previously described in PMID:8300637

CD spectral measurements showed that the secondary structure of the SMK toxin changes drastically in the pH range 5.1-5.5 and that after the dissociation of the subunits, the soluble beta subunit alone cannot take any secondary structure. 
The crystal structure of the SMK toxin indicates that about 60% of the surface of the β subunit comprises hydrophobic residues, that almost all of hydrophobic residues of the β subunit are involved with the interactions with the α subunit and that four pairs of acidic residues, i.e. Asp76(β4)–Asp213(L6),Asp161(L4)–Asp195(β4),Glu158(L4)–Asp222(L6)andAsp199(β5)–Asp222(L6), exist, in each of which the distance between the carboxyl groups is sufficiently short for the formation of hydrogen bonds (Figure 2).
In a previous paper (Suzuki and Nikkuni, 1994), we suggested that the inactivation of the SMK toxin at neutral pH is caused by the dissociation of the two subunits. The CD analyses described here clearly indicate that the structure of the SMK toxin changes under such conditions.
We note three regions in which the electron density is poorly defined. The first encompasses the N-terminal 13 amino acid residues, which are not visible at all. This part of the monomer is probably disordered, and it is not contained in our model.
The C-terminal 6 residues of VP1 monomers α and α″ and the C-terminal 18 residues of β are disordered and excluded from the model presented here.
A DNA-binding domain (DBD) was identified on simian virus 40 (SV40) major capsid protein Vp1, and the domain's function in the SV40 life cycle was examined. The N-terminal location of the DBD is consistent with the crystallographic structure of the virion in which the Vp1 N terminus is oriented toward the minichromosomal core and is disordered. [extracts from abstract and discussion]
Collective results support a role for Vp1 NLS2-DBD2 in the assembly of virion particles. The results also suggest that this determinant can function in the infection of new cells.
Two dimensional 1H/15N correlation (HSQC) 50 NMR spectra collected on hamster PrP 23–106 both with and without PPS exhibited limited chemical shift dispersion (~ 1 ppm), consistent with extensive conformational averaging and a lack of well defined, compact structure (Figure 1).
The majority of chemical shifts of backbone and sidechain atoms were close to random coil values, consistent with the disordered nature of PrP 23–106 58.
Essentially three parts to the protein are readily reflected in simple NMR spectral features: residues 90–112 are characterized by narrow (18 Hz) 15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectral signals and few long-range NOE crosspeaks; residues 113–126 have relatively narrow (ca. 18 Hz) 15N HSQC spectral (ca. 18Hz) signals and many NOE crosspeaks; and most of the remaining residues exhibit ca. 6 Hz broader HSQC signals and numerous NOE crosspeaks.
The PDB shows that this region lacks electron density, indicating that it is disordered.
The fluorescence spectrum of PrP 23–106 exhibited a maximum around 356 nm indicating that the aromatic residues are exposed to the aqueous solvent (Figure 5(a)).
An isodichroic point at ~206–208 nm indicated a β-turn/PPII conformational transition 67, 68, consistent with the β-turn conformation detected by NMR without PPS (described above) and earlier studies of N-terminal PrP fragments, in which PPII and β-turn conformations were recognized 40–43.
The pentosan polysulfate (PPS) is one of the most potent anti-prion.

These findings indicated that addition of PPS to PrP 23–106 enhanced the latter’s β-turn component, again consistent with NMR data.
In contrast, NMR spectra recorded on free PrP 23–106 (i.e. no PPS) but otherwise under identical sample conditions (i.e. buffer/20% DMSO) revealed large differences with NMR spectra acquired on the PrP 23–106/PPS complex.

Here, we investigate the solution structures of the myristoylated and non-myristoylated HIV-1 Nef anchor domain (2–57) under buffer conditions as close to physiological conditions as possible.
The structure of the domain was studied under nearly physiological conditions in aqueous solution; the experimental data show that the isolated domain is not compactly folded and does not have a unique structure. The only canonic secondary structure element found in the non-myristyolated anchor domain is a short α-helical element (helix H2) from Arg35 to Gly41 (Figure 4).
Here, we investigate the solution structures of the myristoylated and non-myristoylated HIV-1 Nef anchor domain (2–57) under buffer conditions as close to physiological conditions as possible.
Myristoylation induces a change of the conformational states of the anchor domain, leading to the stabilization of helix H2 and to the induction of the first helical element H1 (Pro14 to Arg22).

The 6-pm region of the infrared spectrum of protein HMG 17 was obtained in solution at pH 6.8,1 M NaCl to check for the formation of p-structure. The amide 1 band was centred at  1644cm-1 and showed no evi- dence of any low-frequency components between 1630 and 1610 cm-1  that would indicate the formation of 8-structure [16,17].
The high R, value must  therefore be the result of a  disordered structure.
The circular dichroism spectrum of protein HMG 17 in a  high-ionic-strength  buffer at pH 7.9  is shown in Fig. 1 ; the low ellipticity at 222 nm  indicates that under these conditions the protein has little or no helicity. Changing the pH and ionic strength does not alter  the ellipticity at 222 nm substantially  (Table 1) nor the overall shape of the curve.
This was done as described in Materials and Methods, using the same ratio of DNA/ protein as in the NMR experiments,  with NACl added to 0.35,O. 1 and 0 M. No free protein was found in the NaC1-free and 0.1 M NaCl  solutions,  but 75 2, of the  input  protein was  recovered from the 0.35 M NaCl  solution.
 It is  striking that when the protein is bound at low ionic strength, certain resonan- ces are only  slightly affected whilst others are consid- erable reduced in apparent area by line broadening. Thus the arginine,  proline, serine, and to a  certain extent,  valine,  plus leucine  residues are bound. This indicates that the region  between about residues  15 and 40 is the primary binding site.
Since authors do not consider the first Met residue, the binding region boundaries are 16-41.
Both spectra look like that of a  random coil protein with  residues of the same type giving a single sharp peak not showing any spread of chemical shift values. Furthermore, no meth- yl resonances are observed   between 0 and 1 ppm as is normally found with globular  proteins.
In accordance with this expectation, proteolysis of CSD1 and MAP2c under such conditions results in a picture typical of limited proteolysis, featuring the formation of only a few, relatively stable, fragments.
For CSD1, the CD spectrum of the full-length protein has a minimum at 201 nm, characteristic of a protein in a largely disordered conformation (Figure 5A). The spectra of the two halves of the protein, however, are different, with the minimum of the C-terminal half shifted to about 205 nm.
Because the mean hydrophobicity of MAP2c and CSD1 is practically the same (-0.780 for CSD1 and -0.781 for MAP2c, cf. other methods), the difference in their hydration indicates a substantial difference in the extent of their intramolecular interactions: judged simply by the amount of water that they bind, CSD1 appears more ordered than MAP2c.
In other words, its two halves interact in the intact molecule and partially replace each other’s bound water.
In accordance with this expectation, proteolysis of CSD1 and MAP2c under such conditions results in a picture typical of limited proteolysis, featuring the formation of only a few, relatively stable, fragments.
The flexible nature of the backbone leads to narrower, lines resulting in an adequate signal-to-noise ratio.
As the typical helical 3JHNCR value is 4 Hz, the observed values correspond to the mainly random character of hCSD1 (data not shown).
The native ESI mass spectrometry analysis also reveals that RNase E 603–850 has a broad charge distribution in the spectra, which indicates that it has conformational disordered character.
To further investigate the overall structural conformation and degree of flexibility of the subassemblies in solution, SAXS was employed (Figure 3). The Guinier derived radius of gyration (Rg) values for RNase E 603–850, the binary complex and the ternary complex are ∼53, ∼54 and ∼64 Å, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). Comparing these values with expectations for globular proteins of the corresponding Mw suggests that all three particles have non-globular shapes.
The comparatively featureless scattering intensity curve and the smooth and extended P(r) distribution function of RNase E 603–850 indicate that the protein is highly flexible in solution (Figure 3A and B, respectively). Moreover, the dimensionless Kratky profile (dKratky) (54) of this RNase E segment is characteristic of an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), with the intensity increasing gradually and the absence of a peak at lower angles (Figure 3C).
The calculated distribution of Rg values from the ensemble samples a similar space to that of the random pool, suggesting that the isolated RNase E 603–850, in the absence of its helicase and enolase partners, is indeed highly flexible (Rflex values of the ensemble and random pool are very close at 89.4% and 87.3%, respectively). Interestingly, the average Rg value of the ensemble distribution is slightly higher than that of the random pool. Furthermore, the experimental Rg of RNase E 603–850 is greater than the value of ∼46 Å predicted for a typical IDP of the same length (45,55), indicating that the construct is not only highly flexible but also favors extended conformations in solution.
We have structurally characterized a subassembly of the degradosome-comprising a 248-residue segment of the natively unstructured part of RNase E, the DEAD-box helicase RhlB and the glycolytic enzyme enolase, and provide evidence that it serves as a flexible recognition centre that can co-recruit small regulatory RNA and the RNA chaperone Hfq
In this model, the binding of RhlB and enolase facilitates their partner RNase E 603–850 to transition from a highly dynamic state to a molten globule with transient secondary structure elements

The RNA degradosome is a multi-enzyme assembly that plays a central role in the RNA metabolism of Escherichia coli and numerous other bacterial species including pathogens. At the core of the assembly is the endoribonuclease RNase E, one of the largest E. coli proteins and also one that bears the greatest region predicted to be natively unstructured. This extensive unstructured region, situated in the C-terminal half of RNase E, is punctuated with conserved short linear motifs that recruit partner proteins, direct RNA interactions, and enable association with the cytoplasmic membrane.

Our results support a model in which the degradosome captures substrates and regulatory RNAs through the recognition centre, facilitates pairing to cognate transcripts and presents the target to the ribonuclease active sites of the greater assembly for cooperative degradation or processing.
The narrow spread of the peptide backbone amide NH peaks (7.8–8.6 ppm) and the side chain NH peaks (6.6–7.4 ppm) are indicative of a lack of ordered structures over the NMR time scale.
Furthermore, the average proton T2 relaxation times for both of these molecules were on the
order of 60 ms. This is fully consistent with the two proteins being extended and flexible in solution.
Therefore, both BSP and OPN, when purified and isolated in solution, are flexible along their entire length and have no significant regions that persist in a single structural environment for more than a few milliseconds.
Furthermore, our current supply of antisera against OPN also appears to be unable to bind to the OPN when complexed with Factor H (data not shown). This all suggests that essentially
the full length of this SIBLING is tightly bound to either Factor H or to HA and that specific portions of OPN can bind to either of two independent cell surface receptors or to additional regions of Factor H.
In addition to binding to integrins, OPN has been reported to be able to bind to CD44.
The binding of biotin-labeled Opn to A31.C1 CD44 transfectants was dependent on dose, was specific, and was inhibited by an antibody to CD44 but not by an irrelevant antibody.
We confirmed this by analyzing proteins that bound to recombinant glutathione-S- transferase (GST)-Opn (which lacks glycosyl moieties, including HA)
immobilized on Sepharose 4B. Coomassie-stained electrophoresis gels of the desalted eluate showed comigration of the most prominent band with CD44 purified from the same cell line.
Depletion of CD44 from cell lysates with antibody removed this band from the material eluted from the GST-Opn columns.
The addition of tween  BSP  or  OPN  and  Factor  H  can  be  readily  studied  by intrinsic steady state fluorescence. Titration of purified human complement Factor H with rBSPor rOPN was followed by excitation at 295 nm and monitoring emission  between  300  and  450  nm.  The  emission  profile  of Factor H alone yields a peak at 347 nm. The addition of rBSP or rOPN in nanomolar increments causes a relative fluorescent  intensity  quenching.  Conversion  of  the  fluorescent intensity  titration  into  a  binding  curve  by  determining  the fraction of binding sites occupied as the fractional change influorescence quenching at 347 nm yields a saturable binding curves. By steady state fluorescence, the binding of BSP  and  OPN  by  Factor  H  are  saturable  and  possess  a  1:1 stoichiometry, have binding constants in the nanomolar range, given the serum concentration of Factor H (0.5 mg/ml), virtually all BSP and OPN in serum will be complexed with Factor H.
Pretreatment of MEL cells with hyaluronan, anatural  ligand  for  CD44,  as  well  as  with  an anti-CD44 antibody also reduced the protective effect of added rOPN.
For OPN, pretreatment with GRGDS peptide or the aVb3 antibody reduced cell survival, although the magnitude of reduction was not as great as that seen for BSP.
Human milk OPN binds Ca2+with high affinity, and with similar strong exothermicsignal which reaches full saturation at ~90μM.
In separate experiments, a strong endothermic signal for human OPN interaction with Mg2+ was observed.
As expected for an intrinsically disordered protein the proton chemical shift dispersion of the 1H–15N HSQC spectrum shows a narrow profile with chemical shift values close to random coil values.
The total sequence coverage of the MS/MS experiments is 68.5%, and 28 phosphorylation events are identified.
There were so many phosphosites identified that basically the whole protein is hyperphosphorylated.
Twentyeight phosphorylation events are identified on the basis of the 1HN downfield shifts.
There were so many phosphosites identified that basically the whole protein is hyperphosphorylated.
1H–15N HSQC NMR spectra of OPN before (black) and after (red) phosphorylation by Fam20C.
Very narrow chemical shift dispersion is evident from the figure for both the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated osteopontin.
OPN shows Ca2+-binding mainly in the aspartate-rich regime (poly-D regime; 85–116), accompanied by less pronounced perturbations in the other negatively charged regions 70–79, 130–136, 178–188 and 245–260, revealing binding affinities in the lower millimolar range (4–16(3) mM).
Similar to the binding to Ca2+ cations, both OPN and OPNp show CSPs mainly in the negatively charged regions upon the interaction with HAP surfaces. Again, OPN binds to HAP predominantly in the poly-D regime (residues 85 ff.).
CSP stands for chemical shift perturbation, HAP stands for hydroxyapatite. The poly-D regime was already stated to be between residues 85 and 116 when the bindig of Ca2+ ions was investigated.
It has been proposed that osteoclasts use OPN to bridge between the integrins on the cell surface and the mineral phase during resorption of bone matrix. We have shown that Factor H also binds to OPN already complexed to either avb3 integrin or CD44 and this complex can stop the alternate complement lysis pathway. 
These findings demonstrate that the C-terminus is relatively accessible to limited proteolysis and are consistent with the extensive regions of disorder predicted by structure modeling.
We measured intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of CTER under a variety of solution conditions and found this to be so. Fig. 6A (solid line) shows an emission spectrum of CTER, using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. The characteristic broad peak at 348 nm suggested to us that the two tryptophans contained within this domain were rather solvent exposed, as had been predicted by the SEC and AUC results.
The rigorous determination that CTER is monomeric (by AUC) combined with a substantially retarded hydrodynamic elution position (observed by SEC) suggests that CTER possesses an extended conformation and may have a weak affinity for the SEC matrix.
Overall these results suggest that CTER structure, like that in other disordered domains is not affected by macromolecular crowding effects [22], but is appreciably increased in the presence of a hydrophobic environment.
As expected from SEC, AUC, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and previous CD measurements, the spectra also indicate strong contributions from random coil elements (estimated here at ~36%).

Analyses of the Nup2p structure by far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, protease sensitivity, gel filtration, and sedimentation velocity experiments indicate that Nup2p is a "natively unfolded protein," belonging to a class of proteins that exhibit little secondary structure, high flexibility, and low compactness.

Our finding that FxFG domains of nuclear basket nups (Nup1, Nup2, and Nup60) are functional elements of the NPC permeability barrier (Figure 7B) supports the virtual-gate model because these FG domains behave as noncohesive filaments (Figures 2 and 5A).
Contrary to a central prediction made by the selective-phase model (i.e., that all FG domains of nups interact by virtue of their FG motifs), we demonstrated here in vivo and in vitro that some FG domains of nups are not cohesive, including the FxFG domains of Nsp1, Nup1, Nup2, and Nup60 and the SAFGxPSFG domain of Nup159 (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and S4). This finding supports the notion that some FG domains of nups function exclusively as repulsive bristles due to Brownian motion, consistent with the virtual-gate model (Rout et al., 2000).
We also demonstrate that the FG domains of nups are structural components of the NPC permeability barrier in vivo.
The virtual-gate model proposes that FG domains are noncohesive, entropic bristles that repel the entry of non-karyophilic proteins into the NPC through Brownian motion.
The integrity of the NPC permeability barrier was tested in ΔFG yeast lacking the GLFG domain of Nup116 or Nup100, the SAFGxPSFG domain of Nup42, or the FxFG domain of Nsp1, Nup60, Nup1, or Nup2.
We find that Nup60p binds to Nup2p and serves as a docking site for Kap95p-Kap60p heterodimers and Kap123p.
First, Nup60p binds to Nup2p in the absence of additional proteins (KD ∼396 nM) (Fig. 3, A and D) and in crude yeast extracts in the presence of thousands of competitor proteins (Figs. 1 B and 3 C).
Additional evidence suggests that the association between Nup2p and Nup60p at the NPC is dynamic. First, Nup2p fails to copurify with other Nups during the isolation of NPCs (Rout et al., 2000), implying that Nup2p dissociates readily from the NPC. Second, Nup2p–GFP accumulates in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm of yeast lacking Nup60p (Fig. 2 A, middle), raising the possibility that Nup2p shuttles in and out of the nucleus and uses Nup60p as a rest-stop. Third, Nup2p can be tethered (indirectly) to a subset of FG Nups (Nup42p, Nup49p, Nup57p, Nup100p, and Nup116p) via the Kap95p–Kap60p heterodimer (Allen et al., 2001 and data not shown), suggesting that Nup2p moves across the NPC in a Kap95p–Kap60p-dependent manner.
Here we used NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with CD spectroscopy and limited proteolysis to investigate the biophysical properties of the approximately 1500 residue central region of BRCA1. Our results show that although there are a few small, mildly protease-resistant regions, the majority of the BRCA1 central region lacks any pre-existing independently folded globular domains.
NMR spectroscopy was used to characterize the structure of the central region. 1H–15N HSQC spectra were acquired for fragments #2–#21. As shown in Figure 2(A) and Supplementary Figure 1, all 20 proteins had spectra that reflected soluble, non-aggregated, but disordered proteins. Each fragment has very little chemical shift dispersion in the 1H dimension of the HSQC spectrum, and the peak widths were narrow, both features of disordered proteins.
1H–15N HSQC NMR spectra. The majority of the peaks are clustered in between 7.5 ppm and 8.5 ppm in the 1H dimension, indicating an unfolded protein.
These data taken together suggest that a large portion of the central region of BRCA1 does not contain stable, independently folded domains in the absence of binding partners.
Due to the difficulties in purifying large amounts of the full-length BRCA149 for biophysical analysis, we have designed 20 soluble fragments of BRCA1 and used three biophysical assays to demonstrate that fragments #2–#21 encompassing the central region of BRCA1 are mostly intrinsically disordered, with the possibility of having some small secondary structural elements.

In order to test for the presence of secondary structure, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was next utilized. Again, most fragments had similar CD spectra reflective of very little secondary structure. Most fragments had a slight minimum near 220 nm (mean residue ellipticity (MRE)∼3000) suggestive of a very small amount of α-helix and a much stronger minimum near 200 nm reflecting a predominantly disordered protein (Figure 2(B) and Supplementary Figure 2).

Our results show that although there are a few small, mildly protease-resistant regions, the majority of the BRCA1 central region lacks any pre-existing independently folded globular domains.
As a final test for the existence of folded globular domains, limited proteolysis was performed to see if there were any stable, protease-resistant domains in the central region. Most constructs were degraded by trypsin within minutes compared to a positive control using malate synthase, a globular protein which took more than 21 hours to start to degrade under the same conditions (Figure 2(C) and Supplementary Figure 3).
SDS-PAGE of aliquots from a proteolysis time course monitored over 21 hours after incubation with trypsin. In contrast to the globular enzyme malate synthase which is largely resistant to protease digestion for more than 21 hours (Supplementary Figure 3(A)), these constructs are digested by trypsin within ten minutes.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence experiments also demonstrate that, although intrinsically disordered, polypeptides from the central region are able to mediate interactions with DNA and p53 with affinities in the low micromolar range. This supports a model in which the central region may act as a long flexible scaffold for intermolecular interactions, thereby helping to integrate multiple signals in the DNA damage response pathway.
The region previously reported to bind non-specifically to DNA (residues 452–1079) is relatively large (>600 residues), yet appears to be largely disordered. Since DNA binding domains are often small (∼60–150), we therefore suspected that the DNA binding region might actually comprise an even smaller region of BRCA1. Each of the 20 soluble fragments were assayed for binding to a 31 bp double-stranded DNA (Figure 3). Fragments #5–#7, #10, #11, #17, #18, #20 and #21 demonstrated DNA binding at protein concentrations in the low micromolar range. Accounting for the overlapping nature of the constructs, these binding experiments implicate two regions in DNA binding, residues 498–663 (DB1) and 936–1057 (DB2).

A small region of BRCA1 binds weakly to p53
Another part of central BRCA1 that has been reported to interact with other molecules is the region from residues 224 to 500. Zhang et al.31 mapped its interaction, in vitro, to the C-terminal domain of p53 and suggested that such physical association could regulate gene expression through BRCA1-dependent stimulation of p53-mediated transcription. To investigate the strength of the interaction, we measured quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of BRCA1 fragment #19 (residues 219–498) upon binding to various p53 C-terminal domains (residues 311–393, 310–360 and 355–393).
As shown in the titration curves in Figure 4 both the p53 C terminus (residues 311–393), which contains the tetramerization domain, and the p53 basic region (residues 355–393) bound to BRCA1 with relatively weak affinity (Kd values of ∼15 μM and ∼68 μM, respectively).
Analysis of p53 binding to BRCA1 by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. BRCA1 (residues 219–498) which includes four tryptophan residues was incubated with increasing amounts of p53 peptides 311–393 (●), 355–393 (▴) or 310–360 (□) which all lack a tryptophan residue. Binding was assessed by measuring the total tryptophan fluorescence at 354 nm, using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. The change in fluorescence signal, as compared with BRCA1 (residues 219–498) alone, was plotted as a function of target peptide concentration.
We next generated a series of Gal4BD-BRCA1 deletion mutants to map the regions required for interaction with c-Myc. As shown in Figure 1, a small segment of BRCA1 (amino acid residue 433-511, as in pGalBD-BRMS) is both required and sufficient for binding to c-Myc. We designated this region MB1 (for Myc-binding region 1). An N-terminal Myc-binding region (termed MB2) of BRCA1 requires amino acid residues 175-303.
This region corresponds to the first binding site of c-Myc, MB1.

This region corresponds to the second binding site of c-Myc, MB2.
We further found that the BRCA1 protein complexes with the hypophosphorylated form of pRb. This binding is localized to amino acids 304–394 of BRCA1 protein and requires the ABC domain of pRb.
The NH2-terminal 394 aa (ScC7 fragment, amino acids 1–394) also showed stable binding to GST-Rb ABC protein (Fig.6B). However, further truncation of BRCA1 (N-R, amino acids 1–303) completely eliminated the interaction with GST-Rb ABC.
To further demonstrate the binding of pRb to BRCA1, we reversed the probe and target proteins by using GST fusion proteins with BRCA1 fragments GST-N-R (amino acids 1–303) and GST-R-K (amino acids 304–772 shown in Fig. ​Fig.66A) as probe proteins and pRb as target. As before, in vitro-translated Rb protein bound the GST-R-K fragment containing previously identified pRb binding domain in exon 11, but not with the GST-N-R protein or GST alone (Fig. ​(Fig.66C).
BRCA1 Protein Binds to the Hypophosphorylated Form of pRb.
BRCA1-associated growth arrest is RB-dependent
Deletion of Amino Acids 303–394 from BRCA1 Protein Inactivates Its Growth-Suppressive Property.
To test the biological role of Rb-BRCA1 interaction, we performed an in-frame deletion of the 92 aa (amino acids 303–394) from BRCA1 which comprised the putative binding region for Rb protein. When used in colony formation assay, BRCA1-delta90 had no effect on growth control (Fig.8). A construct generating the COOH-terminal truncation of BRCA1 was also ineffective in inhibiting colony formation.
A mutant BRCA1 protein bearing a deletion of the Rb binding domain does not suppress cell growth. Colony formation assay was performed in U2OS cells (as in Fig.1) with wild-type BRCA1 or BRCA1 bearing an in-frame deletion of 90 aa (amino acids 303–394) or a COOH-terminal truncation. Each transfection was done in triplicate in three independent experiments.
BRCA1 residues 758-1064 alone formed Rad51-containing complexes in vitro. Rad51 is also specifically associated with developing synaptonemal complexes in meiotic cells, and BRCA1 and Rad51 were both detected on asynapsed (axial) elements of human synaptonemal complexes. These findings suggest a functional interaction between BRCA1 and Rad51 in the meiotic and mitotic cell cycles, which, in turn, suggests a role for BRCA1 in the control of recombination and of genome integrity.
BRCA1 and Rad51 Colocalize in Discrete Nuclear Foci
Here, we report that BRCA1 and hRad51 colocalize in S phase cells, interact physically, and, in keeping with previous reports of the behavior of hRad51 (2, 53), share common space on the surfaces of zygotene and pachytene meiotic chromosomes.
This suggested that the colocalization of BRCA1 and Rad51 is conditional or transient, even in S phase cells. Similar colocalization results were obtained in WI38 and CV-1 cells.
Among the known FANC proteins, we find evidence for direct interaction only between the FANCA protein and BRCA1. The evidence rests on three different tests: yeast two-hybrid analysis, coimmunoprecipitation from in vitro synthesis, and coimmunoprecipitation from cell extracts. The amino terminal portion of FANCA and the central part (aa 740-1083) of BRCA1 contain the sites of interaction. The interaction does not depend on DNA damage, thus FANCA and BRCA1 are constitutively interacting. The demonstrated interaction directly connects BRCA1 to the FA pathway of DNA repair.

JunB potentiates function of BRCA1 activation domain 1 (AD1) through a coiled-coil-mediated interaction
BRCA1 is involved in the regulation of multiple nuclear events including transcription. AD1, one of the two trans-activation domains in BRCA1, stimulates transcription in a cell context-dependent manner. Here, it is shown that BRCA1 interacts with Jun proteins via a coiled-coil motif in AD1 and the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) region of the Jun proteins. The Jun-interacting domain in BRCA1 is critical for AD1-mediated transcriptional activation. In particular, the strength of AD1 in transcriptional activation is limited by the JunB level and ectopic expression of JunB potentiates the transcriptional activity of AD1. Furthermore, JunB mRNA expression is down-regulated in many ovarian tumor tissues examined. Thus, the coiled-coil-mediated cooperation between BRCA1 and JunB may facilitate the function of these proteins in tissue-specific transcriptional regulation and tumor suppression.
AD1 is necessary and sufficient for BRCA1 binding to the Jun proteins
Further deletional studies within AD1 (Fig.3, constructs 13–16) revealed a minimal JunB-binding domain (Fig.3, construct 15; amino acids 1343–1440), which consists of the coiled-coil motif and an ∼60 amino acid upstream sequence. This finding indicates that the AD1 region is both necessary and sufficient for BRCA1 binding to JunB.

AD1, one of the two trans-activation domains in BRCA1, stimulates transcription in a cell context-dependent manner.

Furthermore, JunB mRNA expression is down-regulated in many ovarian tumor tissues examined. Thus, the coiled-coil-mediated cooperation between BRCA1 and JunB may facilitate the function of these proteins in tissue-specific transcriptional regulation and tumor suppression.
Substitution of two such leucines in the coiled-coil region of BRCA1 (L1407 and L1414) abrogated the BRCA1–JunB interaction (Fig.4A,B, lanes 3–5). Importantly, the same mutations also impaired the transcriptional activity of GAL4–AD in the luciferase reporter assay (Fig.4C, lanes 3–5).
Thus, the affinity of BRCA1 for the Jun proteins strongly correlates with the strength of the trans-activation domain in transcriptional stimulation.
BRCA1 immunostaining reveals discrete, nuclear foci during S phase of the cell cycle.
Here, we report that BRCA1 and hRad51 colocalize in S phase cells, interact physically, and, in keeping with previous reports of the behavior of hRad51 (2, 53), share common space on the surfaces of zygotene and pachytene meiotic chromosomes.
These and other results not shown here indicate that the BRCA1 nuclear dot pattern is S phase–specific.
In this study, we present crystal structures of the intrinsically active CTY30S mutant, providing the first structural views of an active form of CT or LT. To enable accurate structureactivity comparisons, we also independently determined the structure of wild-type CT at higher resolution and accuracy than were previously available (10). Our six new CT structures show an A2 tail conformation that differs markedly from that found in the original CT structure, with interesting implications for toxicity. In addition, the differences between CTY30S and wild-type CT structures permit further insight into the mechanism of CT/LT activation
Residues in the 25-36 “activation loop” were ordered in the originally determined wild-type CT structure and in wild-type LT structures but displayed mostly higher than average B-factors in wild-type LT structures. These residues were included in the molecular replacement model used for CTY30S structure determinations, but density in the CTY30S structures did not support the inclusion of activation loop residues in the final models, suggesting that the activation loop is disordered in CTY30S (Figure 2).
The only major structural changes observed between wildtype CT and CTY30S occur in the level of flexibility found in the activation and active site loops



B-Factors along the activation loop are higher than the average B-factors for the A1 subunits of the CT/LT structures, suggesting that this loop already has a tendency toward disorder (Figure 5). Missing density in the wild-type CT form 2 structure for residues 33-35 further underscores the high level of thermal motion naturally present in this loop (Figure 2). 
The 'activated' state where disorder is observed corresponds to the Y30S point mutant, which is shown to have hogh enzymatic activity, unlike wtCT
Numbering needs to be shifted by 18 residues to match the Uniprot sequence due to the presence of the signal peptide.

The fact that the activation loop is consistently disordered in CTY30S structures but is ordered in wild-type CT structures, despite different packing environments among the crystal forms, indicates that the activation loop is not likely to be affected by crystal packing interactions in these structures. In all wild-type CT structures, both the 25-36 activation loop and 47-56 active site loop are ordered, with a minor exception of the activation loop of wild-type CT form 2.

Role of the ActiVation Loop in the ActiVation Mechanism. Activation loop disorder is the only major conformational difference between the high-resolution wild-type CT structures and all the CTY30S structures. This feature is thus likely to be a key factor for the difference in intrinsic activity between wild-type CT and constitutively active CTY30S, suggesting that disorder in this loop is necessary for the transition between proenzyme and active enzyme


the isolated CTA1 polypeptide has a disordered conformation with minimal enzymatic activity against Gs or synthetic substrates at 37°C (Murayama et al., 1993; Ray et al., 2012). When CTA1-ARF interactions have been examined at 37°C, CTA1 and ARF are typically added together before incubation at 37°C (Murayama et al., 1993; Pande et al., 2007). This protocol allows ARF6 to stabilize the folded conformation of CTA1 initially present at low temperature, but it does not determine whether ARF6 can activate the disordered CTA1 subunit. In this paper we examined whether ARF6 can activate a disordered, as well as a structured, CTA1 polypeptide. A biochemical and biophysical analysis of CTA1 structure / function indicated that ARF6 cannot promote the refolding of disordered CTA1 to an active state. Instead, lipid rafts shifted the disordered, 37°C structure of CTA1 to a folded conformation with a basal level of activity that could be further stimulated by ARF6.
CTA1-ARF6 interactions were initially examined with a protease sensitivity assay (Fig. 1). The isolated CTA1 polypeptide shifts from a protease-resistant conformation to a protease sensitive conformation with increasing temperature, which is consistent with its intrinsic thermal instability (Pande et al., 2007).
Because free CTA1 is an unstable protein, the translocated pool of toxin would remain in a disordered state at 37°C and must therefore engage components of the host cell to regain an ordered, active conformation

ARF6/GTP but not ARF6/GDP prevented the temperature-induced transition of CTA1 to a protease-sensitive conformation (Fig. 1A). This confirmed our previous report (Pande et al., 2007) and demonstrated the active form of ARF6 can stabilize the folded, protease-resistant conformation of CTA1
we heated CTA1 to 37°C before the addition of ARF6. Under this condition, neither ARF6/GDP nor ARF6/GTP protected CTA1 from proteolysis.
In contrast to ARF6, large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) mimicking the composition of a lipid raft could protect CTA1 from proteolysis even when they were added after toxin unfolding had already occurred (Fig. 1B). This was consistent with previous biophysical measurements demonstrating the chaperone-like ability of lipid rafts to stabilize folded CTA1 and to induce both a gain-of-structure and gain-of-function in the disordered CTA1 polypeptide (Ray et al., 2012). ARF6 and lipid rafts thus exhibited overlapping yet distinct interactions with CTA1: both could prevent the thermal unfolding of CTA1 to a protease-sensitive conformation, but only lipid rafts could shift disordered CTA1 back to a protease-resistant structure
Because CTA1 is disordered at 37°C and ARF6/GTP does not promote the refolding of disordered CTA1 (Fig. 2, Table 1), it is necessary for other host factors such as lipid rafts to participate in shifting CTA1 from a disordered conformation to a partially folded active state that is competent for functional interaction with ARFs. The gain-of-structure resulting from toxin-raft interactions allows ARF6/GTP to induce an additional conformational change (Fig. 4, Table 1) that presumably stabilizes displacement of the occluding CTA1 “activation loop” and consequently optimizes the enzymatic activity of CTA1 (Fig. 5A).

CTA1 is in a folded conformation at low temperatures (Pande et al., 2007). We therefore used the FTIR spectrum of CTA1 at 10°C as a reference for the structure of folded CTA1 (Fig. 2A). Analysis of the 10°C FTIR spectrum from CTA1 indicated that the folded toxin contains 35 ± 4% α-helical and 49 ± 3% β-sheet content (Table 1).
Due to its intrinsic thermal instability, heating CTA1 to 37°C resulted in a loss of both α-helical and βsheet structures (Fig. 2B). Concomitant with this loss of secondary structure, the percentage of CTA1 irregular structure shifted from 10 ± 3% at 10°C to 55 ± 2% at 37°C (Table 1). 
Because free CTA1 is an unstable protein, the translocated pool of toxin would remain in a disordered state at 37°C and must therefore engage components of the host cell to regain an ordered, active conformation.

When ARF6/GTP was added to CTA1 before heating to 37°C, the toxin retained its full αhelical structure and a substantial amount of its β-sheet structure at 37°C (Fig. 2C, Table 1). 
The impact of ARF6/GTP on CTA1 α-helical and β-sheet structure thus represents a partial stabilization of the folded toxin, and this is sufficient to maintain folded CTA1 in a protease-resistant conformation (Fig. 1A).
Collectively, these results demonstrated ARF6/GTP can partially stabilize the folded conformation of CTA1 but cannot promote the refolding of disordered CTA1
The lipochaperone function of lipid rafts (Ray et al., 2012) could act in conjunction with ARF to place disordered CTA1 in a folded, active conformation. This possibility was examined by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 4). CTA1 was heated to 37°C for 15 minutes before exposure to lipid raft-mimicking LUVs. Measurements of toxin structure were then recorded after an additional 30 minutes at 37°C (Fig. 4A). In the presence of lipid raft LUVs, the disordered conformation of CTA1 gained both α-helical and β-sheet content (Table 1). An additional gain of β-sheet structure and a further loss of irregular structure were detected when the disordered CTA1 subunit was incubated with both lipid rafts and ARF6/GTP (Fig. 4B). Under this condition, CTA1 exhibited an ordered conformation that matched the structural content of the folded, 10°C toxin (Table 1)

The CTA1 activation loop (residues 25 to 40), earlier suggested to be important in CT and LT activation (24), interacts with both partners but in different ways. The loop forms an ordered coil when bound by CTA2 in wildtype holo-CT structures, but residues 25 to 33 rearrange to form an amphipathic helix upon binding ARF6-GTP (Figs. 1 and 3).
Interestingly, disorder of activation-loop residues 26 to 36 in a CTA1:Y30S mutant results in a holotoxin variant with intrinsic activity (3). Here, activation of CTA1 by ARF6-GTP leads to a well-structured activation loop.

We report the first NMR based solution structural data for the Cholera Toxin enzymatic domain (CTA1). We show that this free enzymatic domain partially unfolds at the C-terminus, and binds its protein partners at both the beginning and end of this activation process.
To evaluate whether the unfolded regions detected within full-length CTA1 are localized to the carboxyl-terminus, we generated and analyzed a mutant form of CTA1 without the carboxyl-terminal region, called CTA1-T2 (N1-F167). For CTA1- T2, the sequence was truncated between F167↓P168P169 as P168P169 make extensive contacts with the CTA2 linker in the holotoxin crystal structure (10) and are likely to destabilize the free enzymatic domain. Spectra of the refolded CTA1-T2 sample show similar chemical shift (δ) values and dispersion to the CTA1 sample (Supplementary Figure 4). Most of the changes in the 1H/15N HSQC spectrum corresponded to a decrease in the number of resonances within the random coil region, while leaving unaffected the dispersed resonances, suggesting that the structure of the catalytic core domain was unaffected by the truncation of the Cterminus.
The 2D NMR 1H/15N HSQC spectrum of recombinant CTA1 (N1-G186) (Figure 3a) revealed that CTA1 is partially unfolded and displays the characteristics of a molten globule in solution [for review, see (34)]. Notably, only 20% of the total amide protons resonated either up-field or down-field when compared to the random coil chemical shift region between 7.5 and 8.5 ppm (34–36). Moreover, there is considerable variation in peak intensity within the 1H/15N HSQC spectrum, likely due to intermediate exchange broadening.
The free CTA1 enzymatic domain is partially unfolded, in contrast to when it is complexed with either CTA2 in the holotoxin or with ARF6-GTP following retrotranslocation. Further strengthening this argument was that the refolded recombinant CTA1 is catalytically active (23) and, due to its thermal instability, CTA1 is a substrate for export to the cytosol via the ERAD pathway (33).
Numbering needs to be shifted by 18 residues to match the Uniprot sequence
We report the first NMR based solution structural data for the Cholera Toxin enzymatic domain (CTA1). We show that this free enzymatic domain partially unfolds at the C-terminus, and binds its protein partners at both the beginning and end of this activation process.
Many of the resonances present in the central random-coil region of the free enzyme are dispersed in the NMR spectrum for the active complex sample where CTA1 is selectively labeled. Thus, the binding of ARF6-GTP ligand to CTA1 results in an ordering (folding) of partially unfolded regions within the free enzymatic domain, indicating an allosteric coupling between these interaction partners (37).

We propose that the primary role of ARF6- GTP binding is in site-to-site allostery (37) that couples the refolding of the C-terminus of CTA1 with the formation of a high-affinity CTA1:ARF6-GTP complex
Thus, CTA1 undergoes an ordered (holotoxin) to disordered (free CTA1) to ordered (CTA1:ARF6-GTP complex) structural transition (Figure 7) to accommodate the dual requirements of retrotranslocation and activation. This model proposes that the partially unfolded free enzyme recruits proteins from the ERAD pathway to promote its own retrotranslocation from the ER to the cytosol.

Partial unfolding of CTA1 is further illustrated by using bis-ANS fluorescence as an indicator of the exposed hydrophobic character of the free enzyme, which is substantially reduced when bound to ARF6-GTP
The bis-ANS fluorescence reflects the extent of hydrophobic exposure (38) of CTA1 when compared to both the CTA1:ARF6-GTP complex and Gdm-HCl denatured samples (Figure 4). These data indicate bis-ANS fluorescence of the full length CTA1 sample is reduced in the truncated CTA1-T2 sample, and further reduced in the CTA1:ARF6-GTP sample or in the presence of chemical denaturants. These results indicate a loss of hydrophobic bis-ANS binding sites upon ARF6-GTP binding to the enzymatic domain, when fully unfolded or when truncated at the C-terminus. Therefore, ARF6-GTP binding is sufficient to induce profound changes in CTA1: from a partially disordered state in the free enzyme to an ordered state within the CTA1:ARF6-GTP complex.

A cholera toxin mutant (CTX–K63) unable to raise cAMP levels was used to study in Vero cells the retrograde transport of the toxin A subunit (CTXA–K63), which possesses a COOH-terminal KDEL retrieval signal. Microinjected GTP-g-S inhibits the internalization as well as Golgi–ER transport of CTXA–K63. 
IgGs as well as Fab fragments directed against Erd2p, b-COP, or p23, a new member of the p24 protein family, inhibit or block retrograde transport of CTX-A–K63 from the Golgi without affecting its internalization or its transport to the Golgi. Anti-Erd2p antibodies do not affect the binding of CTX-A to Erd2p, but inhibit the CTX-K63–induced translocation of Erd2p and p53.
To analyze for a possible contribution of the cytoplasmically oriented COOH terminus of Erd2p to the sorting and the retrograde transport of the occupied Erd2p we analyzed the effect of antibodies raised against the COOH terminus of Erd2p on the retrograde transport of CTXA–K63. Anti-Erd2p IgGs injected before start of CTX– K63 uptake, did not significantly affect the retrograde transport from the plasma membrane to the Golgi (Table I). However, when the IgGs were injected 10–20 min after start of CTX–K63 uptake, we observed in ~60% of the cells an accumulation of CTX-A–K63 in perinuclear structures and an inhibition of translocation of CTX-A–K63 from the Golgi to the ER (Table I). 
To exclude the possibility that the anti-Erd2p–induced inhibition of retrograde transport of CTX-A–K63 from the Golgi to the ER had resulted from a decreased binding of CTX-A–K63 to Erd2p, we measured the effect of the anti-Erd2p antibodies on the binding of 125I-labeled CTX-A to permeabilized Golgi vesicles from Sf9 cells overexpressing human Erd2p. The antibody binding was performed at pH 7.2, the binding of CTX-A to Erd2p at pH 6. At pH 6 the binding of CTX-A to Erd2p was still sufficiently high (z60% of the binding observed at pH 5, unpublished results). Preincubation of the permeabilized Golgi membranes with anti-Erd2p antibodies did not affect binding of CTX-A to Erd2p (Fig. 9). Binding of CTX-A was specific as CTX-A could be displaced from the membranes by low concentrations of KDEL peptides but not by peptides without a COOH-terminal KDEL sequence (results not shown here). 
This is a true positive KDEL signal in the Eukaryotic Linear Motif Database
Cholera toxin is assembled from two subunits in the periplasm of Vibrio cholerae and disassembled in the analogous compartment of target cells, the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), before a fragment of it, the A1 chain, is transported into the cytosol. We show that protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) in the ER lumen functions to disassemble and unfold the toxin once its A chain has been cleaved. 
We designed an assay that mimics the postulated disassembly of the toxin in vivo: after arrival in the ER, the B subunits should remain bound to the ganglioside GM1 in the membrane, while the A1 fragment of the toxin should be dissociated. In our assay, membrane bound ganglioside is replaced by GM1 covalently bound to polystyrene beads. Upon incubation with ER proteins, the B subunits are expected to stay with the beads and the A1 chain to be released. The A and B subunits of the toxin were expressed in V. cholerae and the holotoxin was purified (Rodighiero et al., 1999). Due to the presence of high levels of secreted proteases in the growth medium of V. cholerae, most of the toxin molecules (about 90%) had their A subunit cleaved into the A1 and A2 fragments. The purified, nicked holotoxin was bound to GM1-coated beads and incubated under different conditions. 
To test whether the holotoxin is dissociated by ER proteins, we prepared a lumenal extract from canine microsomes and incubated it with the toxin beads. A significant fraction of the A1 subunit was found to be released into the supernatant after collection of the beads (lanes 4 and 6). 
Next, we investigated whether the release of the A1 subunit was accompanied by its unfolding. To this end, we developed a protease protection assay. Addition of high concentrations of trypsin to the folded holotoxin left all polypeptide species intact (Figure 1B, lane 2 versus 1). However, after the addition of an extract derived from the ER lumen, the A and A1 subunits were degraded whereas the B subunit remained unaffected (lanes 4 and 6). Reduction of the disulfide bridge in the A subunit was insufficient to cause trypsin sensitivity (lane 2 versus 1). 
Our results provide insight into the pathway of cholera toxin from its synthesis in bacteria up to its arrival in the lumen of the ER in mammalian cells, where its A1 fragment is released from the rest of the toxin and unfolded in preparation for its translocation into the cytosol. 
Our results explain why cholera toxin is assembled and folded in the periplasm of bacteria and disassembled and unfolded in the ER, even though both compartments normally support the folding of polypeptides. One decisive factor is that the A subunit needs to be cleaved into the A1 and A2 fragments for unfolding to occur. The periplasm of bacteria seems to lack proteases that cleave the A chain, and in this compartment, the two subunits can therefore assemble and fold into the native holotoxin.  Once in the ER, PDI binds to the A1 chain and causes it to unfold, but it leaves the ring of B chains intact.

We show that protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) in the ER lumen functions to disassemble and unfold the toxin once its A chain has been cleaved. 
To identify the unfolding activity in the ER lumen, we bound the proteins of the lumenal extract to a Q-Sepharose column. Upon elution with a salt gradient, protein fractions were analyzed for their ability to confer trypsin sensitivity to the A and A1 subunits. Addition of fractions 9 or 10 resulted in complete degradation of these toxin polypeptides (Figure 2A, lanes 18 and 20), similar to the effect observed with the unfractionated extract (lane 4). 
Fractions 9 and 10 contained one major band of ap- proximately 60 kDa (Figure 2B, lanes 8 and 9). This band was excised and identified as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) by mass spectroscopy. Immunoblotting with an antibody directed against PDI confirmed this identifi- cation (Figure 2C, lanes 8 and 9). 
In addition, further purification of the material in fraction 9 on a S-Sepharose column demonstrated perfect cofractionation of PDI and the unfolding activity (Figure 2D). To confirm that the major unfolding activity in the ER lumen can be attributed to PDI, we immunodepleted PDI from the ex- tract (Figure 2E, left panel, lane 2 versus 1). While mock- depleted extract confered trypsin sensitivity to the toxin A and A1 subunits, the PDI-depleted extract was inactive (Figure 2E, right panel, lanes 6 versus 14).

Yeast PDI behaved in a similar way as the mammalian enzyme, despite their low sequence similarity (less than 25% identical amino acids). Purified yeast PDI was un- able to unfold the A subunit under oxidizing conditions (Figure 4A, lane 6 versus 5), but was active under reducing conditions (lane 8 versus 7). Similarly, it gave crosslinks to the A subunit only under reducing conditions (Figure 4B, lane 4 versus 3).

To determine whether HSC70 binds directly to CTA1, we perfused HSC70 over a CTA1-coated surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor at 15 or 37 °C (Fig. 4A). Previous studies have shown by CD, tryptophan fluorescence, and FTIR spectroscopy that CTA1 maintains a folded conformation at low temperature but transitions to a partially unfolded state at the physiological temperature of 37 °C (7, 49). HSC70 could bind to both the folded conformation of CTA1 present at 15 °C and the disordered conformation of CTA1 present at 37 °C. 
Both HSC70 and HSP90 form tight complexes with CTA1, as little dissociation is seen after removal of the chaperone from the perfusion buffer (Fig. 4A) (17, 18). We previously calculated a 7 nM KD affinity between HSP90 and CTA1 at 37 °C (17). HSC70 exhibited a similar 5 nM KD affinity for CTA1 at 37 °C (Fig. 4B). However, host-toxin interactions are not identical for the two chaperones: HSC70 will bind to either folded or disordered CTA1, whereas HSP90 only recognizes disordered CTA1 (18). 
To identify the CTA1-binding site(s) for HSC70, we generated a series of peptides that contained overlapping amino acid sequences from the entire length of the CTA1 subunit. As summarized in Table 1, HSC70 bound two consecutive peptides spanning CTA1 amino acid residues 73–98. These peptides contained a shared YYIYVI sequence that likely represented the core HSC70-binding site. The YYIYVI sequence alone could not be generated as a soluble hexapeptide, but we found a truncated GQTILSGHST peptide that lacked the YYIYVI motif and a mutant GQTILSGHSTYYLYVL peptide with leucine for iso- leucine substitutions in the YYIYVI motif could not bind to HSC70 (Table 1). These results indicated the YYIYVI motif was recognized by HSC70.  A competition assay further established the specificity of HSC70 binding to the YYIYVI sequence (Fig. 6). For this experiment, CTA1 was appended to an SPR sensor slide and exposed to perfusion buffer containing either HSC70 alone or HSC70 in combination with a CTA1-related peptide. HSC70 could bind to CTA1 in the absence of peptide and in the presence of the mutant GQTILSGHSTYYLYVL peptide. However, HSC70 could not bind to CTA1 in the presence of the GQTILSGH- STYYIYVI peptide. These observations confirmed HSC70 specifically recognizes the YYIYVI sequence in CTA1. 
18 residues need to be added to the numbering reported by the authors to match the Uniprot entry. The binding site YYIYVI corresponds to residues 101-106. HSP70 from  commercial origin, Enzo Life Sciences (Farmingdale, NY) corresponds to Bovine HSP70
Hsp90 bound to CTA1 in an ATP-dependent manner that was blocked by geldanamycin (GA), an established Hsp90 inhibitor.
To address this issue, SPR was used to determine whether Hsp90 could directly interact with the isolated CTA1 subunit at physiological temperature (Fig. 1A). Hsp90 binding to CTA1 occurred in an ATP-dependent manner that was blocked by GA. This demonstrated that Hsp90 could bind to CTA1 at 37 °C. Because CTA1 is in an unfolded conformation at 37 °C (22, 24), this also suggested that Hsp90 recognizes an unfolded conformation of CTA1 during the dislocation event
The interaction between Hsp90 and CTA1 was much stronger than the interaction between GRP94 and CTA1: Hsp90 bound to CTA1 with a KD of 7 nM, whereas GRP94 bound to CTA1 with a KD of 292 nM (Fig. 2 and Table 1). Consistent with the dimeric natures of Hsp90 and GRP94 (31), both chaperones bound to CTA1 in a 2:1 ratio of chaperone:toxin (Fig. 2). The specific, high-affinity interaction between Hsp90-ATP and CTA1 indicated that Hsp90 could be involved with the CT intoxication process
HSP90 origin is extracted from PMID: 31221799 to be Human HSP90 (Commercial origin; Biovision)
The C-terminal sub-region Myc92–167 is partly helical with negative minima at 208 nm and 222 nm, while the N-terminal sub-region Myc1–88 shows little negative ellipticity around 222 nm and a minimum shifted towards 200 nm, which indicates a mainly random structure with low helical content.
Myc1–167, Myc92–167 and Myc1–88 had emission maxima of 348, 342 and 351 nm, respectively, in non-denaturing buffer (Figure 5a) suggesting that the tryptophan residues are not completely buried in any of the proteins.34 All three proteins had an emission maximum at 353–355 nm under denaturing conditions, in agreement with data for unfolded proteins.34 This indicates a decrease in solvent exposure for Myc1–167 and Myc92–167 in native buffer that is in agreement with a partly folded structure, whereas the small change for Myc1–88 suggests that Myc1–88 remains unfolded, in agreement with the CD results.
In aqueous solution and over a range of temperatures, the c-myc1-143 polypeptide showed little or no secondary structure (Figure 5A). The spectra showed the characteristics of a random conformation with a minimum at around 200 nm and progressively nearing zero at wavelengths above 210 nm.
However, the observed spectrum for the mixture is clearly distinct from the calculated additive spectra (Figure 6B). The most striking difference is the shift to the right and reduction in the minimum at around 200 nm derived from the c-myc1-143 polypeptide. Furthermore, the change in the 200 to 222 nm ratio to near unity is consistent with conversionof a random coil to an α-helical conformation.
Both 15N-R1 and {1H}-15N-nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) relaxation of pSer62-c-Myc1–88 correspond well to results obtained for c-Myc1–88 at similar concentrations (Figures S1E–S1G), suggesting that the intrinsic disorder with transiently structured regions identified for c-Myc1–88 (Andresen et al., 2012) is maintained upon Ser62 phosphorylation.
These observations are in agreement with the formation of dynamically disordered (Forman-Kay and Mittag, 2013), or “fuzzy” (Fuxreiter and Tompa, 2012), complexes.
Binding of intact Pin1 to non-phosphorylated c-Myc1–88 results in major loss of signal intensity primarily in the conserved, transiently ordered MB0 region, but also affects the MBI region (Figures 3A and 3D). Intact Pin1 binding to pSer62-c-Myc1–88 more clearly affects the phosphorylation site and flanking residues, and perturbations extend into the transiently helical and conserved MBI region around c-Myc1–88-Trp50, while the C-terminal part remains comparatively unperturbed (Figure 3D).
Furthermore, the NMR results suggest that the conserved, transiently structured MB0 region in c-Myc1–88 is central for Pin1 interactions with c-Myc1–88 irrespective of the phosphorylation state of Ser62.
MB0 region corresponds to residues 10–35 and MBI corresponds to the 44-63 region.
After extensive buffer optimization, the resolution in the HSQC spectrum of Myc-1–88 (Figure 2) is characteristic of an intrinsically disordered protein, with all amide proton shifts confined to 7.7–8.6 ppm. However, while intrinsically disordered proteins typically have uniformly sharp resonances, the Myc-1–88 spectra demonstrated heterogeneity of peak intensities and peak shapes likely reflecting an interconverting and transiently interacting heterogeneous ensemble of states.
Relaxation parameters for interpretable residues show that in the unbound state, the entire Myc-1–88 behaves as an intrinsically disordered protein with intermediate mobility (Figure 7; empty symbols). The magnitude of the heteronuclear NOEs are consistent with a disordered region, but are higher than expected for single-domain intrinsically disordered proteins. Instead, their magnitude resembles those of longer intrinsically disordered regions linked to well-folded globular domains (61,62).
SPR measurements showed significant binding of Pin1 to unphosphorylated c-Myc outside of the Pin1-targeted MBI (Figures 2, S2A, and S2B), and, in agreement NMR mapping of HNCO intensity ratios, suggests that Pin1 primarily binds to the MB0 region (c-Myc10–35) (Figure 3).
MBI corresponds to the 44-63 region.
This indicates a decrease in solvent exposure for Myc1–167 and Myc92–167 in native buffer that is in agreement with a partly folded structure, whereas the small change for Myc1–88 suggests that Myc1–88 remains unfolded, in agreement with the CD results.
Fitting the denaturation curves to a linear extrapolation model assuming two-state unfolding33 shows that both Myc1–167 and Myc92–167 have low cooperative unfolding but that Myc1–167 has a significantly higher melting transition temperature (∼41 °C) than does Myc92–167 (∼32 °C) (Figure 4b).
The low cooperativity in unfolding is also consistent with a molten globule-like state.
After immobilization, the activity of the three c-Myc surfaces was assayed by MM-1 and TBP, which have previously been shown to bind to c-Myc.18, 26 Both of the proteins showed binding to Myc92–167 and Myc1–167 (Figure 7) but no significant binding was seen to Myc1–88, not even at higher concentration of MM-1 or TBP.
Myc1–167 showed a shift in spectral intensity upon binding to MM-1 consistent with an increase in secondary structure upon binding to MM-1. A much smaller shift was observed for MM-1 with Myc92–167, whereas the spectrum of Myc1–88 with MM-1 was identical with the theoretical additive spectrum.
A selective interaction was observed between c-myc1-143 transactivation domain and TBP and the RAP74 subunit of TFIIF (Figure 2A).
Expression of wild type c-myc1-143 fused to the DBD of the glucocorticoid receptor in yeast cells resulted in strong (almost 200-fold) induction of a lac Z reporter gene driven by a single glucocorticoid response element (Figure 3A).
The lack of long and medium-range NOEs shows this region is disordered.
The lack of long and medium-range NOEs shows this region is disordered.
Alone, c-Myc353–437 displayed a CD signal typical of disordered protein regions (Tompa, 2002).
IDR boundaries are 353-439 since region 437-439 is not long enough to be ordered. 
The shortest C-terminal fragment of c-Myc (mutant Δ2–366) was still able to bind to Skp2, suggesting that aa residues 367–439, comprising the HLH-Zip domain of c-Myc, are sufficient for Skp2 binding.
Taken together, these results suggest that the interaction between c-Myc and Skp2 requires an intact MB2 and a region in the HLH-Zip domain of c-Myc.
In vitro binding studies showed that deletion of MB2 alone or in combination with MB1 reduced binding of IVT c-Myc to GST-Skp2, whereas deletion of MB1 alone had no effect (Figure 2C, left panel). Deletion of the C-terminal aa 215–439 (mutant ΔC) reduced but did not eliminate binding, whereas the combined ΔC+ΔMB2 deletion abolished the GST-Skp2 interaction.
Taken together, these results suggest that the interaction between c-Myc and Skp2 requires an intact MB2 and a region in the HLH-Zip domain of c-Myc.
MB2 comprised the region 129-142.
The binding of these peptides to Fbw7 was strongly dependent upon T58 phosphorylation (Fig. 3D).
These data indicate that T58 phosphorylation regulates the physical interaction of Fbw7 with the c-Myc CPD and is required for Fbw7-driven c-Myc turnover.
C-Myc CPD corresponds to the Cdc4 phosphodegron motif 55-62.
We determined the structure of the complex between Bin1C−12A and a synthetic peptide, c-Myc(55-68), which includes the entire proline-rich region (Figure 5(a) and (b); and Table 1).
Both peptides were also able to interact with the Bin1CΔPxxP mutant, yielding Kd values of 18.4 μM for 12A and 9.2 μM for c-Myc.
The His6-c-Myc substrate was shown to be phosphorylated by immunoblot analysis with antibodies that specifically recognize c-Myc phosphorylated on Thr-58 and Ser-62 (Figure 3C); the mutant His6-c-Myc(T58A/S62A) was not phosphorylated.

Recombinant Fbw7 interacted only with the phosphorylated form of the peptide, whereas Skp2, Fbw1a, Fbw2, or Fbw4 did not interact with either form (Figure 3A). 
The far-UV CD spectra for HIF-1α 530–698 and HIF-1a 403–603 (Figures 2A and 2C) lacked the typical signatures of secondary structure (negative bands at 222 and 208 nm for α helices and a negative band at 217 nm for β sheets), exhibiting instead only a small signal at 200 nm.
HIF-1α 530–698 and HIF-1α 403–603 eluted from the gel filtration column as well-defined peaks corresponding to Mr 95,500 and 134,700, respectively (Figure 1A), values five and six times larger than the calculated theoretical values of 18.8 and 22.3 kDa.
These results imply that both HIF-1α 530–698 and HIF-1α 403–603 have the dimensions of denatured proteins and have extended conformations.
Analysis of the sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation experiment, however, showed that both proteins were monomeric with a Mr of 18,000 ± 120 and 22,000 ± 500 (Figure 1B; as an example for HIF-1α 530–698).

Hif-1α (776–826) in the unbound state is intrinsically disordered; its circular dichroism spectrum is characteristic of a random coil (data not shown) and the NMR spectrum lacks dispersion (Fig.1, red cross peaks).

The CAD becomes structured upon binding to TAZ1, as evidenced by the pronounced increase in dispersion of the amide proton resonances (Fig.1, black cross peaks).
The structure of the bound Hif-1α CAD is better defined after Gly-791.
The extended region of the Hif-1α CAD leads directly into a short α-helix (residues 796–804), termed αB, which docks in a groove formed by the N-terminal end of α1, helix α3, and the Zn3 site of TAZ1 (Fig.2B). Another helix, αC, is formed by residues 815–824. Helices αB and αC lie on opposite sides of helix α3 of TAZ1 (Fig.2B); residues 804–813 form an irregular bridge over α3 and make numerous contacts with the surface of TAZ1. In particular, the conserved leucines at positions 812 and 813 (Fig.4A) together with Ile-806 form a shallow hydrophobic groove that fits over two turns of helix α3 (Fig.4D).

Residues 776–790 in the N-terminal region of the Hif-1α CAD are poorly defined in the structures. Nevertheless, intermolecular NOEs are observed which show that this region of the CAD does bind, albeit weakly, in a broad shallow groove formed by helices α1 and α4 of TAZ1.

Yeast two-hybrid assays confirmed that the constructs used for the NMR experiments, HIF-1α (776–826) and TAZ1 (345–439), interact specifically and with high affinity in vivo.
The dissociation constant of the TAZ1/HIF-1α CAD complex was determined to be 7 ± 1 nM by ITC.
In addition, HIF-1α 530–698 and HIF-1α 403–603 both migrated as a 32 kDa protein in an SDS-PAGE gel even after heat denaturation (Figure 1A, inset).
These results imply that both HIF-1α 530–698 and HIF-1α 403–603 have the dimensions of denatured proteins and have extended conformations.

In contrast with HIF-1α 530–698, at the highest ionic strength (I 200 mM) it was possible to detect weak binding (Kd 600 μM) between HIF-1α 403–603 and p53 core, while at I 150 mM the binding was slightly tighter, Kd 200 μM.
In both cases, however, the AUC data described species of 23 ± 1.2 and 48 ± 1 kDa, suggesting that even when the HIF-1α 403–603 construct contains the two binding sites predicted by Hansson et al. (2002), the stoichiometry of the complex is 1:1 (Figures 4C and 4D).
For HIF-1α 530–698, at an ionic strength of 200 mM, no binding was detected, and the data best described a single species of Mr 21,000, corresponding to HIF-1α 530–698 alone. At physiological ionic strength (I 150 mM), the interaction was very weak (Kd 690 μM).
Using fluorescence anisotropy (Figures 5A and 5B), at lower ionic strengths the binding was tighter, with dissociation constants 30 and 0.16 μM at I 56 and 20 mM. respectively.
Although the residues 776–790 of HIF-1α, were implicated to interact, albeit weakly, with CBP [17], the two peptides showed similar binding affinities, with the dissociation constants of 196 ± 39 nM for F-HIF-1α-(776–786) and of 198 ± 23 nM for F-HIF-1α-(786–826). On the other hand, FP of F-HIF-1α-(788–822) increased much less, while F-HIF-1α-(776–813) showed no FP increase up to 3 μM GST-CBP (Fig. 2A).
These results confirm that the residues identified by RAMSY are functionally critical for CAD transcriptional activity in mammalian cells.
Therefore, we conclude that Leu-795, Cys-800, Leu-818, and Leu-822 of HIF1a are functionally indispensable for CAD transcriptional activity in mammalian cells.
In contrast, recognition of HIF-1α by VCB E3 ligase (pVHL, elongins B and C, Cul2 and Rbx1; ref. 10) requires hydroxylation of specific prolyl residues by a group of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent, non-haem dioxygenases11,12.
Electron density for HIF-1α peptide residues 560–577 is of good quality, with only the side chain of E560 poorly defined (Fig. 1). The peptide lies in an extended conformation across one side of the β-domain of pVHL (Fig. 2a, b), binding to one of the β-sheets as if it were a complementary β-strand, although there is no extensive main-chain hydrogen bonding to define it as such.
Within the CODD peptide, residues 560–567 and 571–577 form distinct binding sites (sites 1 and 2, respectively).
Site 1 (EMLAHypYIP) is the primary binding site, contributing more than 60% of the total buried surface area and van der Waals contacts.

Hydroxylated human CODD and NODD, and C. elegans ODD peptides, bind VCB with similar kinetics and binding affinities (29–53 nM).
It binds pVHL in a bipartite manner, with two discontinuous HIF-1α segments interacting with a continuous site on pVHL. A six-residue NH2-terminal segment (residues 561 to 566; N segment) that is centered on Hyp564 (Hyp is the three-letter code for hydroxyproline), and a four-residue COOH-terminal segment (residues 571 to 574; C segment) are separated by a four–amino acid bulge that does not contact pVHL (Fig. 1B).
A 20-residue HIF-1α ODD region (destruction sequence), conserved in animal orthologs and paralogs, is necessary and sufficient for hydroxylation by HPHs and for binding to pVHL (12, 13).
pVHL is the substrate-recognition subunit of a ubiquitin-protein ligase that also contains ElonginB, ElonginC, Cul2, and Rbx1 (VBC-CR complex) (6–9).

The recombinant murine prion protein, mPrP(23-231), was expressed in E. coli with uniform 15N-labeling. NMR experiments showed that the previously determined globular three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal domain mPrP(121-231) is preserved in the intact protein, and that the N-terminal polypeptide segment 23-120 is flexibly disordered.
Dots represent the 98 residues of the N-terminal segment 23-120, which shows features of a flexible, 'random coil-like' polypeptide, with rotational correlation times for the ''N-'H groups of τc < 1 ns.
The N-terminal polypeptide segment 23-120 has a small dispersion of the proton chemical shifts and τc-values <1 ns for the 15N-1H moieties, which is typical for a flexible 'random coil-like' polypeptide chain.
We report that PrP(C) interacts with vitronectin but not with fibronectin or collagen. The binding sites mediating this PrP(C)-vitronectin interaction were mapped to residues 105-119 of PrP(C) and the residues 307-320 of vitronectin.
Of the twenty peptides from mouse PrPC covering the whole protein sequence used to compete for PrPC-Vn binding, two of them, corresponding to PrPC residues 103-122 and 113-132, effectively blocked (by ∼80%) PrPC-Vn binding (Fig. 2a).
Binding assays performed using four PrPC molecules presenting small deletions on the putative Vn binding site, revealed that the PrPC deletion mutants Δ105-112, Δ113-119, and Δ105-128 did not bind Vn, whereas mutants Δ51-90 and Δ120-125 exhibited binding capacity similar to that of the wild-type molecule (Fig. 2b). These data corroborate that the region comprising a.a. 105-119 of PrPC includes the binding site for Vn.
To distinguish whether the 95–110 charge cluster or the octapeptide repeat domain is crucial for Aβ42 binding, a mutant lacking the 52–91 segment was expressed. The Δ52–91 mutant exhibits significant Aβ42 binding, implicating the 95–110 region as a principal site for Aβ42-oligomer binding. Consistent with this hypothesis, deletion of 11 aa in the Δ95–105 variant reduces binding by 80%, and there was no further reduction in the Δ70–105 variant. 
Of six antibodies initially tested, only one (6D11) blocked the binding of Aβ42 assemblies to PrPC with an IC50 of 1 nM (Fig. 3b–d, Suppl. Fig. 8–10). The epitope for 6D11 corresponds to aa 93–109 of mouse PrPC, matching the conclusion that the 95–105 region is a primary determinant for binding. To confirm this hypothesis, we examined the effect of an additional antibody (8G8) with an overlapping epitope, aa 95–110. The 8G8 antibody blocked Aβ42-PrPC interaction, though with a lesser potency than 6D11.
Location and properties of metal-binding sites on the human prion protein
In this protein, residues 91–123 are unstructured and the NMR analysis shows that during titration to stoichiometry the major shifts occur in this region, chiefly centered around histidine residues 96 and 111.

Hence, the single binding site for transition metals on PrP (91) is selective and follows the order Cu(II) >> Ni(II) > Zn(II) >> Mn(II).
Location and properties of metal-binding sites on the human prion protein
Fig. ​Fig.33 shows a copper(II) titration of the octapeptide-repeat segment corresponding to residues 52–98.
Copper(II) binding in the absence of glycine is biphasic; there is an initial phase representing the occupation of a single tight site, giving the ≈40% quench, followed by a weak binding phase with a Kd of 15 μM, which accounts for the remaining 50% loss of indole fluorescence.
Nickel(II) binds with a dissociation constant of 2 × 10−8 M, some six orders of magnitude weaker than copper(II). 
The authors use a soluble version of the N-terminus region of the Prp protein fused to a Fc domain (PrPN/Fc) to induce its solubility and export to the extracellular region. This region competes with the N-terminus of the wt anchored Prp protein to avoid the interaction with toxic aggregates and preclude subsequent toxicity.
We tested the ability of PrPN/Fc to interfere with toxic signalling of Aβ via PrPC. To this end, we employed the co-cultivation assay of PrPC-expressing SH-SY5Y cells with Aβ-secreting CHO-7PA2 cells. Indeed, co-expression of the secreted N-terminal domain of PrP (PrPN/Fc) significantly reduced toxic signalling of Aβ via PrPC (Figure 5E).
a-synuclein interacts with PrPC to induce cognitive
impairment through mGluR5 and NMDAR2B
To investigate the region(s) of PrPC that mediate the aSyn effects, we targeted three regions in the protein using different antibodies against PrPC: 6D11 (epitope targeting the region 93–109 of PrPC; 100 nM), 8B4 (epitope targeting the N terminus of PrPC; 10 µg) and C-20 (epitope targeting the C terminus of PrPC; 10 µg) (Fig. 1d). In slices pre-treated with 6D11 antibody, the effect of aSyn oligomers on LTP was blocked (P < 0.001; Fig. 1c). In contrast, pre-treatment with 8B4 or C-20 had no effect (P > 0.05; Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1h). This suggests that the 93–109 segment of PrPC is the crucial region for aSyn-induced toxic effects.
Thus, PrPC deletion or blockade at the 93–109 segment prevents aSyn-oligomer-induced impairments in both LTP and basal synaptic transmission, suggesting that PrPC mediates this synaptic dysfunction in a 6D11-sensitive manner.
We asked whether PrPC was required for the observed aSyn-induced Src activation, but we could not detect any effect of aSyn on Src activation in neuronal cultures from Prnp−/− mice (P > 0.05; Fig. 2e). In addition, we found that the 6D11 antibody prevented Src activation by aSyn (P < 0.001; Fig. 2d,e), whereas neither the 8B4 nor C-20 antibodies prevented Src phosphorylation.
Y1472 of NMDAR2B is a major phosphorylation site of Fyn kinase15. We examined total and phosphorylated levels  of Y1472 NMDAR2B in neuronal cultures exposed to aSyn oligomers for different time periods. After 5 min of exposure, an increase in the levels of phospho-NMDAR2B was already detected, with no changes in the total levels of NMDAR2B (Supplementary Fig. 3f,g). This increase was blocked by the 6D11 antibody and the Fyn inhibitor (PP1, 30 μM, 25 min; P < 0.05; Fig. 2f), but was not affected by the 8B4 or C-20 antibodies. Consistent with this, aSyn oligomers failed to induce further NMDAR2B phosphorylation in neuronal cultures from Prnp−/− mice (Fig. 2f).
Thus, aSyn requires PrPC, particularly the 93–109 region, to induce Fyn activation and subsequent NMDAR2B phosphorylation, which may underlie the LTP impairments observed in the presence of aSyn oligomers.
As a consequence of the aSyn-Prp mediated activation of Fun and hyperphosforilation of NMDAR2B, disregulation of Ca2+ occurs and subsequent synaptic disfunction. 

our data suggest that the amino acid region 93–109 of PrPC is involved in mediating the toxic effects of aSyn.
Next, by pulling down PrPC, we detected Fyn, NMDAR2B and aSyn in the same complex in WT, but not in Prnp−/−, slices in both control and aSyn-exposed slices (Fig. 2h). This was further validated by reverse co-IP, in which we pulled down aSyn and detected NMDAR2B, Fyn and PrPC (Fig. 2h).
Importantly, PrPC is extracellular and both Fyn and NMDAR2B are intracellular proteins. Authors also report that mGluR5 transmembrane protein might act as molecular bridge between PrPC, Fyn and NMDAR2B. Although authors do not provide evidence of a direct interaction. 
When we immunoprecipitated either PrPC or aSyn from the hippocampus of aSyn transgenic mice, we detected the counterpart of the aSyn-PrPC complex (Fig. 2h)
Two antibodies to two different epitopes of PrPC abrogated the inhibition of LTP by two different sources of tau, recombinant soluble aggregated tau and AD brain-soluble extract. On the basis of the present findings, PrPC appears to be a crucial site of action for tau-mediated disruption of synaptic plasticity in vivo. 
Both antibodies target specific regions of the disordered N.terminus of Prp. One of them, MI-0131 antibody targets specifically 23-51 region of Prp.

Authors test whether AB soluble aggregates (SBAs), alpha-synuclein soluble aggregates (SAAs) and TAU soluble aggregates (STAs) are able to bind PrP in the absence and in the presence of competing antibodies, analyzed by ELISA. Being, MI-0131 a specific antibody of the 23-51 region and ICSM35 a specific antibody of the region 93-105. Both regions comprised in the N-terminus intrinsically disordered region of PrP. To confirm the hypothesis, the authors analyzed the interaction of PrP truncations lacking one or both of the hypothesized interacting regions.
AB-->SBAs bound to PrP23–231 with an average EC50 of 38.9 nM, whereas neither Aβ monomers nor fibrils showed appreciable affinity for PrP (Fig. 2a). We tested whether mAbs directed to Site I (MI-0131) and Site II (ICSM35) (Supplementary Table 2) could prevent SPA binding. Both mAbs bound similarly well to PrP (Supplementary Figure 1e) and displaced SBAs to a comparable extent, with ICSM35 always slightly more effective (Fig. 2d).
Alpha-synuclein and TAU --> SAAs (Fig. 2b) and STAs (Fig. 2c) also bound to PrP in a saturable manner with average EC50s of 34.3 nM and 9.5 nM, respectively. Monomeric and fibrillar forms of αSyn and tau exhibited weak or no affinity for PrP23–231. we tested whether mAbs directed to Site I (MI-0131) and Site II (ICSM35) (Supplementary Table 2) could prevent SPA binding. Both mAbs bound similarly well to PrP (Supplementary Figure 1e) and displaced SBAs to a comparable extent, with ICSM35 always slightly more effective (Fig. 2d). Interestingly, comparable IC50 trends were observed for SAAs (Fig. 2e; ICSM35 = 5.2 nM and MI-0131 = 11.9 nM) and STAs (Fig. 2f; ICSM35 = 2.0 nM and MI-0131 = 5.0 nM). Similarly, SAAs and STAs showed little affinity for PrP119–231 and greatly diminished binding to PrP91–231 (Fig. 2h, i).

Authors study LLPS of the full-length protein and truncated versions corresponding to the disordered N-term, occurring in vivo. N1 harbors both interacting regions of the IDR of PrP, while N2 only harbors one interacting region. C1 and C2 correspond to the C-terminus PrP resulting from each cleavage, respectively. Finally, they mutate key charged residues (recognition motifs) and hydrophobic residues (central region of N1) to demonstrate that LLPS of Prp is driven by cation-pi interaction. 
Full-length PrP rapidly formed droplets upon TEV protease cleavage, indicative of LLPS (Fig. 1C, TEV+). N1 underwent phase separation similarly to full-length PrP, indicating that the structural elements in the C-terminal domain are not required for the formation of biomolecular condensates. In contrast, N2 formed irregular assemblies instead of liquid-like droplets. Consequently, we analyzed C1 and C2, the C-terminal fragments generated after α- or β-cleavage, in parallel to N1 or N2 (Fig. 1A). Both before and after TEV cleavage, GFP fluorescence was evenly distributed, indicating that neither C1 nor C2 formed biomolecular condensates under these conditions, corroborating recent results (41).
Full-length PrPs as well as N1 molecules in the droplets were highly dynamic, characteristic of a liquid-like state. In contrast, fluorescence recovery of the irregular N2 structures was greatly delayed, indicating formation of a gel-like or aggregated state (Fig. 2A, lower panels). 
Results: We analyzed the conformation of phase-separated N1 after purifying recombinant N1 lacking both the MBP and GFP tag. The CD spectrum of N1 is characterized by a negative CD band below 210 nm, indicating that the protein displays a fully disordered secondary structure at this condition (46).
On the molecular level, phase separation is governed primarily by basic residues within the Aβ-binding domain, most likely through intermolecular cation–π interactions of the lysines with neighboring aromatic side chains (Fig. 4). 
Authors study LLPS of the full-length protein and truncated versions corresponding to the disordered N-term, occurring in vivo. N1 harbors both interacting regions of the IDR of PrP.
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments were carried out to determine the size of the N1 droplets (Fig. 2E). Based on the intensity distribution functions of the hydrodynamic radius, the N1 samples exhibited a largely polydisperse size distribution pattern, indicative of droplet formation of sizes ranging from 40 to several 1000 nm.
n total we identified 233 N-PrP-binding partners in the AD brain (Fig 2, S1 Table) and 212 in the non-AD brain (Fig 2, S2 Table). Among those 104 were overlapping interactors found in both brain homogenates (Fig 2, S3 Table), while 129 proteins were exclusively found in AD brain (Fig 2, S4 Table) and 107 in non-AD brain (Fig 2, S5 Table).
These findings support the concept that the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain is a major mediator of PrP-protein interactions.
DEcyto has two tryptophans that are near the N and C termini, the latter in a position distinct from the tryptophan in Ecyto. In a folded protein, the tryptophan indole ring is frequently buried within a hydrophobic core or is otherwise shielded from solvent, resulting in a blue shift of the fluorescence maximum relative to free tryptophan (36). The tryptophan emission maximum for β76, a thrombin-generated fragment of β-catenin (see “Experimental Procedures”), is significantly blue-shifted relative to tryptophan alone, whereas the maxima for Ecyto and DEcyto are not (Table I). Thus, the single Ecyto tryptophan and two DEcyto tryptophans appear to be solvent exposed.
The fluoresence anisotropy data suggest that the Ecyto and DEcyto domains are unfolded under native conditions.
Fluorescence, circular dichroism, and proton NMR were used to characterize the folded state of recombinant E-cadherin and DE-cadherin cytoplasmic domains (rEcyto and rDEcyto respectively).

The spectra measured for rEcyto and rDEcyto at 0 °C are essentially identical and feature a single minimum in mean residue ellipticity at ∼202 nm (Fig. 1). This spectrum indicates a lack of secondary structure, which would be expected of an unstructured polypeptide.
Fluorescence, circular dichroism, and proton NMR were used to characterize the folded state of recombinant E-cadherin and DE-cadherin cytoplasmic domains (rEcyto and rDEcyto respectively).
rDEcyto-β-catenin complex was also digested with subtilisin as described for rEcyto.
However, in the presence of β-catenin, what appears to be full-length rEcyto remains at subtilisin (Fig.5) and endoproteinase Glu-C (data not shown) concentrations that completely degrade rEcyto alone (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 7 or lanes 12 and14). Similar protection results were obtained with the DEcyto-β-catenin complex and subtilisin (data not shown).

Mixtures of rEcyto or rDEcyto and various β-catenin constructs were incubated for more than 1 h at 4 °C and injected onto an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech HR 10/30 Superdex 200 size exclusion column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, and 1 mmDTT. 
It is proposed that binding of cadherins to beta-catenin prevents recognition of degradation signals that are exposed in the unstructured cadherin cytoplasmic domain, favoring a cell surface population of catenin-bound cadherins capable of participating in cell adhesion.
The region 1125–1176, which constitutes a long loop between strands
β3 and β4, is disordered in both structures consistently with the lack of long range NOEs involving these residues and with its afore mentioned dynamics.
A protein loop of 50 amino acids located between β3 and β4 is disordered
and mobile on the subnanosecond time scale. 
The unstructured loop was omitted for simplicity. Bottom panel, the backbone traces for the twenty lowest energy conformers are superimposed.
Notably, the CopA N-domain lacks the long unstructured loop involving
residues 1125–1176 of N-MNK.

Seven residues upstream and nine residues downstream of the cleavage site are

The gp5 lysozyme domain, located on the periphery of the central

the C-terminal b-helical domain by linker 2, which contains the
cleavage site between gp5* and gp5C (Fig. 1a). Seven residues

The N-terminal sequences of these three bands as determined by Edman degradation were MEMISNN-, MEMISNN-, and AMAATVA-, respectively, indicating that the last two bands were the cleavage products of the first and that the two fragments were held together after cleavage
By contrast, the relaxation parameters for the C-terminal QUA2 region indicate substantial backbone flexibility. In particular, the decreased 15N R2 values and the large negative NOEs observed for residues 183–188 and 202–214 (Figure 3) are characteristic of extensive local motion on the sub-nanosecond timescale.
VHL residues 1–59 are disordered and not observed in the structure.
Yet, the near-UV CD experiments show an absence of a tertiary structure.
We therefore conclude that, under native conditions, the non-bound pVHL has a molten globule configuration with marginal stability.
The near-UV CD spectra of pVHL at 25 °C shown in Fig. 1B reveals no significant signals originating from aromatic side chains, thus suggesting a dramatic loss of tertiary structure of the soluble and unbound protein in comparison with the complex-related crystal structure.
Here, we present clear evidence of a molten globule conformation of the pVHL tumor suppressor protein under physiologically relevant solvent conditions.
The indications of a molten globule structure of pVHL are clear, given that the protein possesses a typical combination of an apparent secondary structure (Fig. 2A) with no tertiary structure
Upon the addition of urea, even at very low concentrations, the protein unfolds in a non-reversible manner, leading to the formation of amorphous aggregates.
We therefore conclude that, under native conditions, the non-bound pVHL has a molten globule configuration with marginal stability.
The degree of denaturation was assessed by monitoring ellipticity changes at 222 and 218 nm as a function of urea concentrations. As can be observed in Fig. 2, the unfolding of pVHL occurs at fairly low urea concentrations. Unfolding as reflected by a significant reduction in ellipticity was observed at urea concentrations as low as 0.25 m at both temperatures. Furthermore, the unfolding event was partially irreversible, and the formation of amorphous aggregates could be visualized by the naked eye.
However, the linear nature of the initial slope of the curve and the aggregative behavior implies that unbound pVHL stability is marginal, as was observed previously with other tumor suppressor proteins
The thermodynamic stability of the secondary structure as observed by CD is also marginal; at very low concentrations of urea the protein undergoes denaturation (Fig. 2), which results in some extent of aggregation.
Dynamic light-scattering and gel filtration chromatography of the purified pVHL clearly indicated that the Stokes radius of the protein is larger than what would be expected from its crystal structure. However, under these conditions, the protein shows a clear secondary structure as determined by far-UV circular dichroism.
We therefore conclude that, under native conditions, the non-bound pVHL has a molten globule configuration with marginal stability.
Size exclusion chromatography was therefore used to estimate the hydrodynamic dimensions of the protein and as a probe for elucidating the compactness of the protein's tertiary structure, because the elution volume of partially or fully unfolded proteins is significantly smaller than that of well folded proteins due to the large increase in the Stokes radius.
Fig. 3A shows the Kav versus Mw plot; the calculated Kav for pVHL was 0.191, corresponding to a molecular mass of 47,130 Da (calculated with curve's equation), which is larger than the theoretical molecular mass value of pVHL (19,000 Da). Fig. 3B shows √-logKav versus Stokes radius (RS); according to this relation, the calculated RS for pVHL is 30.8 Å.

We therefore conclude that, under native conditions, the non-bound pVHL has a molten globule configuration with marginal stability.
The measured hydrodynamic radius was 3 nm, and the estimated molecular mass was 43 kDa. These values, taken together with the size exclusion chromatography results, are significantly larger for the solution form of the protein than the values obtained from the folded pVHL crystal structure. This could indicate a somewhat flexible and non-compact conformation for the unbound protein.
The percent of scattered mass as attributed to the apparent hydrodynamic radius. RH for pVHL is 3 nm and estimated Mw is 43 kDa.
Here, we present clear evidence of a molten globule conformation of the pVHL tumor suppressor protein under physiologically relevant solvent conditions.
The fluorescence of the hydrophobic ANSA probe is much stronger in the presence of molten globular state of proteins than with a rigid, well folded, or fully unfolded state (36). Fig. 5 shows that, upon binding to pVHL, ANSA fluorescence intensity increases by 50-fold, whereas the emission spectrum indicates a blue shift toward 400 nm. This could suggest that the hydrophobic core exists, but in a rather loosely packed conformation, and is therefore consistent with a molten globule tertiary structure.
Furthermore, such a significant increase in ANSA fluorescence (Fig. 5) clearly indicates a molten globule structure rather than the existence of a monomeric or dimeric well folded protein or, alternatively, an unfolded one.
Here, we present clear evidence of a molten globule conformation of the pVHL tumor suppressor protein under physiologically relevant solvent conditions.
The sedimentation equilibrium data fit well to a single species with a calculated apparent molecular mass of 18,200 Da, implying that pVHL is monomeric in solution. This agrees very well with the Mr established by SDS gel electrophoresis and the Mr of 8,500 Da predicted for pVHL from the DNA sequence. There was some degree of aggregation, as observed at the lower part of the tube. This may reflect a moderate degree of nonspecific aggregation as may be expected for a partially unfolded protein after long incubation at high concentration.
Upon the addition of urea, even at very low concentrations, the protein unfolds in a non-reversible manner, leading to the formation of amorphous aggregates.
The degree of denaturation was assessed by monitoring ellipticity changes at 222 and 218 nm as a function of urea concentrations. As can be observed in Fig. 2, the unfolding of pVHL occurs at fairly low urea concentrations. Unfolding as reflected by a significant reduction in ellipticity was observed at urea concentrations as low as 0.25 m at both temperatures. Furthermore, the unfolding event was partially irreversible, and the formation of amorphous aggregates could be visualized by the naked eye.
However, the linear nature of the initial slope of the curve and the aggregative behavior implies that unbound pVHL stability is marginal, as was observed previously with other tumor suppressor proteins
The thermodynamic stability of the secondary structure as observed by CD is also marginal; at very low concentrations of urea the protein undergoes denaturation (Fig. 2), which results in some extent of aggregation.
pVHL binds to HIF only when a conserved proline in HIF is hydroxylated, a modification that is oxygen-dependent. The 1.85 angstrom structure of a 20-residue HIF-1α peptide–pVHL–ElonginB–ElonginC complex shows that HIF-1α binds to pVHL in an extended β strand–like conformation. The hydroxyproline inserts into a gap in the pVHL hydrophobic core, at a site that is a hotspot for tumorigenic mutations, with its 4-hydroxyl group recognized by buried serine and histidine residues.
To investigate the targeting of HIF-1α by the VBC-CR ubiquitin-protein ligase and the basis of hydroxyproline recognition in intracellular signaling, we determined the 1.85 Å crystal structure of the pVHL–ElonginB–ElonginC (VBC) complex bound to the hydroxyproline-containing 20-residue destruction sequence of HIF-1α (Table 1 and fig. S1). The structure shows that a 15–amino acid portion of HIF-1α (residues 561 to 575) adopts an extended, β strand–like conformation (Fig. 1A). It binds pVHL in a bipartite manner, with two discontinuous HIF-1α segments interacting with a continuous site on pVHL.
HIF-1α interacts exclusively with the β domain of pVHL. It binds alongside the β sandwich, making five backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds (Fig. 1A). The side of the pVHL β sandwich where HIF-1α binds has the hydrophobic core partially exposed. This exposed hydrophobic patch, together with several partially buried polar residues, makes up the binding site of the hydroxyproline.
The hydroxyproline has a central role in complex formation. It is nearly entirely buried, with 96% of its accessible surface area in a hypothetical free peptide covered by pVHL. The pyrrolidine ring inserts toward the partially exposed hydrophobic core of the pVHL β domain, making multiple van der Waals contacts with Trp88, Tyr98, and Trp117 of pVHL (Fig. 2A). The 4-hydroxyl group inserts farthest into pVHL and forms hydrogen bonds with the Nδ of His115 (2.7 Å) and the OH group of Ser111 (2.7 Å), both of which also form hydrogen bonds with other pVHL groups (Fig. 2A). His115 and Ser111 are partially solvent exposed in the apo-VBC structure (10) but become entirely buried on HIF-1α binding.
The dotted lines indicate hydrogen bonds between the Gln67Oδ1, Tyr98 Oη, His110 NH, and His110 CO groups of pVHL, and the Leu562 NH, Hyp564 CO, Tyr565 NH, and Tyr565 CO groups of HIF-1α.
Compared with Hyp564, the other N-segment residues make significantly fewer contacts. Among them, Ile566 makes the most contacts, interacting with Pro99 and Ile109 of pVHL. Met561 packs with Phe91 of pVHL, Leu562 with Tyr112and Arg69, Ala563 with Trp88, and Tyr565 with His110 (Fig. 2A).
pVHL residues contacting HIF1α: N67, R69, W88, F91, Y98, P99, I109, H110, S111, Y112, H115, W117.
To investigate the targeting of HIF-1α by the VBC-CR ubiquitin-protein ligase and the basis of hydroxyproline recognition in intracellular signaling, we determined the 1.85 Å crystal structure of the pVHL–ElonginB–ElonginC (VBC) complex bound to the hydroxyproline-containing 20-residue destruction sequence of HIF-1α (Table 1 and fig. S1).
The α domain binds ElonginC, which, in association with ElonginB, recruits the VBC complex to Cul2-Rbx1 to form the ubiquitin-protein ligase (8–10).
pVHL residues Leu158 and Lys159 contact residue Cys112 of Elongin C.
Mutation of the VHL tumor suppressor is associated with the inherited von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) cancer syndrome and the majority of kidney cancers. VHL binds the ElonginC-ElonginB complex and regulates levels of hypoxia-inducible proteins. The structure of the ternary complex at 2.7 angstrom resolution shows two interfaces, one between VHL and ElonginC and another between ElonginC and ElonginB. Tumorigenic mutations frequently occur in a 35-residue domain of VHL responsible for ElonginC binding. A mutational patch on a separate domain of VHL indicates a second macromolecular binding site.
The VHL-ElonginC interface is almost completely hydrophobic with only a handful of significant hydrogen bonds at the periphery (Fig. 3A). The H1 helix of the VHL α domain fits into the concave surface of ElonginC, inserting hydrophobic side chains into pockets along the surface (Fig. 3A). Reciprocally, the H4 helix of ElonginC, which bulges out from the side of the concave surface, fits into an extended groove formed by the H1, H2, and H3 helices of the VHL α domain and completes the intermolecular four-helix cluster packing (Fig. 3A).
The H1 helix of the VHL α domain coincides with the 12–amino acid segment shown to be important for ElonginC binding (10), and the structure reveals that it makes extensive contacts to ElonginC. The most significant van der Waals contacts are made by Leu158, which protrudes from the H1 helix and fits into an ElonginC pocket, and by Cys162 and Arg161 (Fig. 3A). These are augmented by contacts from the Lys159, Val165, Val166, and Leu169 side chains of VHL (Fig. 3A). The other two helices of the α domain also contribute contacts (Leu178, Ile180, and Leu184), with Leu184 making the most extensive ones in this region (Fig. 3A). Additional contacts are made by residues in the first α-β linker (Leu153 and Val155) and by Arg82 from the β domain (Fig. 3A). The hydrogen bonds made by Arg82, together with those made by Lys159 and Arg161 from the H1 helix, represent the few significant hydrogen-bond contacts made at the VHL-ElonginC interface. The arginine side chains are also anchored in the hydrogen-bond networks of the VHL α-β domain interface (Fig. 2D). 
pVHL residues contacting Elongin C: R82, L153, V155, Y156, L158, K159, R161, V165, V166, L169, L178, I180, L184
This evidence corresponds to the Arg82 site from pVHL β domain.

Here we report that using in silico approaches, we identified six (3-9 residues long) fragments predicted to harbor propensity to form amyloid fibrils. By a series of complementary biophysical techniques, including ThT binding assay, CD spectroscopy, Congo Red birefringence, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray diffraction, we found that two of the fragments, 72SQVIFCN78 and 147IFANITL153 , self-assembled in vitro and formed canonical amyloid fibrils β-sheets rich structures.
We performed TEM analysis to visualize the morphology of the SN7 and IL7 assemblies. As shown in Figure 2b and 2c, the assemblies exhibited fibrillar morphology for SN7 and IL7 aggregates, respectively.

Furthermore, we performed AFM imaging to get additional details regarding the structural parameters such as height and diameter of the amyloid fibrils. Representative AFM images of amyloids formed by SN7 and IL7 are shown in Figure 2e, 2f, respectively. The amyloids of SN7 appeared as clusters of intercalated fibrils with a height of 5-10 nm and of diameter ~30 nm (n=30). The IL7 amyloids were observed to be of 3-13 nm height with a diameter of ~46 nm and varying length (n=30).

Among all the six peptides, two heptapeptides, namely 72SQVIFCN78 and 147IFANITL153 (hereafter termed SN7 and IL7, respectively) Figure. 1d exhibited a significant increase in ThT intensity compared to the other peptides when used at 100 µM, indicating their high propensity to self-assemble into amyloids.
To obtain deeper insights on the SN7 and IL7 aggregation kinetics, the two peptides were subjected to aggregation assay for 48 hours, using ThT as a real-time monitoring probe at physiological pH and temperature in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer. As shown in Figure. 1e, both peptides displayed rapid aggregation kinetics, with an undetectable lag phase, reaching a plateau after 24-27 hours.

To further validate the ThT results, we performed CD analysis of these peptides before (t=0 hours) and after the aggregation (t=48 hours) to detect the amyloid-specific secondary structural changes. The concentration used for recording CD spectra was 400 µM to obtain a better signal-to-noise ratio. The CD spectra exhibited a negative ellipticity at 195 nm for IL7 and 200 nm for SN7 at the beginning of the aggregation (t=0), suggesting that the peptides possessed random coil conformation in their monomeric form. At the end of the aggregation period (t=48 hours), the individual peaks shifted to 220-224 nm, which is indicative of the β-sheet rich structures by both peptides (Figure. 2a). β-sheet formation is a characteristic hallmark of amyloid structures, thus substantiating the findings from ThT analysis, suggestive of self-assembly of the heptapeptides to form amyloids.

This observation was further corroborated by collecting an X-ray diffraction pattern for the self-assembly of both peptides. Classical amyloid fibrils exhibit a characteristic diffraction pattern that displays the inter-strand distance of 4.5-4.8 Å and inter-sheet distance of 10-11Å, due to the specific arrangement of β-sheets in an amyloid fiber.

We subsequently investigated the amyloidogenic nature of SN7 and IL7 aggregates using the amyloid-specific Congo Red (CR) dye. CR is a histopathological dye routinely used to diagnose amyloids formed in vitro and in tissue biopsies. [18] The dye can bind to the cross-β-sheets of amyloids, and this interaction results in the exhibition of apple-green birefringence when observed under cross-polarized light.

We confirmed the physical interaction of DJ-1 and VHL proteins in SH-SY5Y cells by immunoprecipitating VHL using VHL antibody and mouse IgG-conjugated beads and probing for endogenous DJ-1 (Fig. 1A). We observed that endogenous DJ-1 was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous VHL 
VHL was one of the baits and analysis of the dataset suggested DJ-1 as one of its interacting candidates with the interaction confidence score of 0.31 an unbiased mass spectrometry screen, which indicated Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein as a potential interacting partner.
In vitro-translated 35 S-labeled VHL interacted with GST–HDAC-1, GST–HDAC-2, and GST–HDAC-3 fusion proteins but not with GST (Fig. 7A).
VHL
residues 1–213 or 1–155 bound to the GST–HDAC fusion
proteins whereas VHL(1–58) and VHL(1–57) did not (Fig.
7B).
In vitro-translated 35 S-labeled VHL interacted with GST–HDAC-1, GST–HDAC-2, and GST–HDAC-3 fusion proteins but not with GST (Fig. 7A).
Taken together with
the cotransfection assays, these studies demonstrate that
VHL functions as a corepressor by recruiting HDACs to
HIF-1 alpha.
In addition, we
demonstrate that FIH-1 binds to VHL and that VHL also functions as a transcriptional corepressor that
inhibits HIF-1alpha transactivation function by recruiting histone deacetylases.
To demonstrate binding directly and to localize the
region of FIH-1 that interacted with VHL and with HIF-
1 alpha, 35 S-labeled FIH-1 that was either full length (1–349)
or lacking N-terminal residues (126–349) was synthesized and tested for interaction with FLAG-tagged VHL
or GST–HIF1 alpha (531–826). FIH-1(1–349) bound to FLAG–VHL or GST–HIF-1 alpha (531–826), whereas FIH-1(126–349)
bound only to GST–HIF-1 alpha (531–826) 
Whereas VHL residues
1–155 were sufficient for binding to FIH-1, residues
1–213 were required for efficient binding to HIF-1 alpha (Fig.
4C). These studies indicate the presence of distinct bind-
ing sites that allow the simultaneous interaction of FIH-
1, HIF-1 alpha, and VHL.

Regarding the expression of various factors, that of CD133 was decreased in the VHL transfectants and those of STAT3, JAK2 and Elongin A were eliminated.  However, the expression of PTEN and of VHL was upregulated.
VHL inhibited STAT3, JAK2 and Elongin A.
In addition, VHL upregulated PTEN expression.
The restoration of VHL function in vitro in the VHL-deficient CC-RCC cell lines was found to reinstate PL6 expression, thus establishing a direct link between VHL and PL6.
We found that functional VHL inactivation caused down-regulation of PL6 expression, thus suggesting transcriptional regulation of PL6 by pVHL.
Northern blot analysis demonstrated that PL6 expression was significantly lower in cell lines with mutated VHL as compared to their wtVHL-transfected counterparts or to KRC/Y and 293T cell lines
The restoration of VHL function in vitro in the VHL-deficient CC-RCC cell lines was found to reinstate PL6 expression, thus establishing a direct link between VHL and PL6.
Immunostaining analysis of VHL-deficient tumours (CC-RCC, haemangioblastoma and epididymal adenocarcinoma) showed no PL6 positivity compared to matched normal tissues and was in line with regulation of PL6 expression by pVHL.
Immunostaining of these cells with anti-PL6 antibodies showed no PL6 protein in VHL-deficient cells, while their wtVHL-transfected derivatives were positive for the PL6 protein. KRC/Y and 293T, cell lines with intact VHL gene, had a high PL6 protein level. 
To identify low occupancy VHL protein partners with potential relevance to renal cancer, we screened a human kidney library against human VHL p30 using a yeast two-hybrid approach. Jade-1 (gene for Apoptosis and Differentiation in Epithelia) encodes a previously uncharacterized 64-kDa protein that interacts strongly with VHL protein and is most highly expressed in kidney.
The human Jade-1 gene was
identified as a particularly strong VHL-interacting clone in a
yeast two-hybrid screen of human VHL p30
Jade-1 immunoprecipitation of these same cell lysates permitted coimmunoprecipitation of VHL with full-length Jade-1, dd, and del1, but not with del2 (Fig. 3F). Likewise, VHL immunoprecipitation allowed coimmunoprecipitation of full-length Jade-1, dd, and del1, but not del2 (Fig. 3G). The VHL interaction with del1 did appear reduced, even taking into account lower del1 expression. As expected, immunoprecipitation in the absence of either partner did not show the interaction (Fig. 3, F and G, end lanes).Thus, these experiments demonstrate that the Jade-1 carboxyl terminus and PHD regions themselves are not absolutely required and that the amino terminus and the inter-PHD region in particular may be most important for interaction with VHL. These findings also support the specificity of the VHL-Jade-1 interaction.
We identiﬁed 30 genes (0.2 of total genes analysed) that demonstrated a >=X2-fold difference between VHL+ and VHL- cells in both experiments and in the three different clones.
Expression of target genes was normalized tob-actin and results for the 11 genes analysed are shown in Table 1. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed the results of the microarray analysis for all 11 genes.
Genes regulated by VHL: MLC2, GPR56, CDKN1C, P311, GLS, DOC-2/DAB2, GNG4, Claudin 4, SPARC, MCT3, E3, VEGF, PAI-1, beta-actin.
We transiently transfected empty vector (pCDNA3.1, In-vitrogen) or the wild-type pVHL (pCDNA 3.1-VHL (1–213) HA) into RCC4 cells to determine whether theresults of transient transfection were consistent withthose for stable transfection. The expression of fourgenes was analysed (CDKN1C, P311, Claudin 4 and E3) by real-time PCR and these demonstrated similar resultsin transient and stable transfections.
To determine whether pVHL regulation of target gene transcripts was reﬂected in protein levels, Western blots of RCC4/VHL+ and RCC4/VHL- protein extracts were probed with anti-CDKNIC and anti CT-3 antibodies. In each case the effect of pVHL on the transcripts was mirrored by the effect on protein levels. Thus pVHL upregulated CDKNIC and downregulated MCT3 protein expression (Figure 2).
The relationship between pVHL regulation of target genes in an isogenic cell line and in primary RCC with VHL inactivation (somatic VHL mutation73p25 allele loss) was analysed in up to nine paired normal–tumour pairs. For CDKN1C (n=8), GNG4 (n=8), GPR56 (n=8), GPR56 (n=8),  MCT3 (n=4), MLC2 (n=6), P311(n=8) and SPARC (n=7), all tumours tested demonstrated altered expression consistent with the cell line data (results showed threshold of X2-fold differential expression).For DOC-2/DAB26/7  clear  cell  RCC  with VHL inactivation  demonstrated  downregulation  comparedto matched normal tissue. However, E3 and CDN4 demonstrated altered expression in only a minority of the primary tumours tested (4/9 and 1/3, respectively)(data not shown).
VHL was one of the baits and analysis of the dataset suggested DJ-1 as one of its interacting candidates with the interaction confidence score of 0.31 an unbiased mass spectrometry screen, which indicated Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein as a potential interacting partner.
The results of the colony-formation assay in soft agar medium demonstrated significantly greater colony formation in the control vector-transfected compared to the VHL‑expressing vector-transfected U87 GSLCs. 
Neurosphere formation, which is a reflection of the self‑renewal ability, was also significantly greater in the former than in the latter (P<(B) Results for neurosphere formation. After one week, soft agar colony formation of VHL gene‑transfected GSLCs was significantly

Proliferation of control vector-transfected U87 GSLCs was significantly more pronounced compared to the VHL gene-transfected GSLCs 7 days following transfection (P<0.01) (Fig. 4C), although the difference between them was smaller than in the case of the soft agar colony or neurosphere formation assay.

These results suggest that VHL affected the JAK̸/STAT pathway as well as the PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway; they also suggest that upregulation of PTEN by VHL gene transfer may affect the PI3K/Akt pathway, since PTEN is a PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor

To determine whether the LIR motif of VHL specifically binds to LC3B, we generated point mutants of the VHL LIR motif (VHL-Y98H; VHL-L101A; VHL-Y98H and L101A, a double point mutant containing Y98H and L101A) using site-directed mutagenesis. Wild-type or mutant VHL and Flag-tagged LC3B were expressed, purified from Escherichia coli, and used in in vitro binding assay with the indicated proteins. Results show that the L101A mutation completely prevented the interaction between VHL and LC3B, whereas the histidine mutation at tyrosine 98 had no effect (Fig. 3g).
Taken together, the N-terminal LC3B and LIR motif of VHL interacted directly both in vitro and in vivo.
The annotated region includes the canonical LIR motif (YPTL) at positions 98-101.

VHL directly binds to LC3B, the major marker of autophagy.
We observed that LC3B co-localized with VHL in the cytosol (Fig. 3b). To determine the region of LC3B that binds to VHL, various truncations of LC3B were generated based on the sequence of the N-terminally Flag-tagged wild-type LC3B.
In conclusion, our results showed that pVHL interacts with MAPL1LC3B and inhibits LC3B-mediated autophagy via MAP1LC3B ubiquitination. Furthermore, the activation of autophagy by the proteasome inhibitor MLN9708 induced cell death, indicating that MLN9708 can be used for VHL-deficient RCC therapy.
Polyubiquitination of LC3B is induced by the VHL E3 ubiquitin ligase.
We performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay using each indicated protein and an ATP-regeneration system. We observed that LC3B was polyubiquitinated by the VHL E3 ubiquitin complex in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4b) and was subsequently degraded via the proteasome.

Immunofluorescence staining was performed to identify the localization of LC3B and the 28S proteasome in cells with respect to VHL expression. Results show that Flag-LC3B and the 28S proteasome proteins co-localized more in VHL-deficient 786-o cells than in 786-o cells stably expressing VHL (Fig. 4f). This indicated that VHL ubiquitinated the N-terminal region (1−162 amino acids) of LC3B, and the leucine 101 in the LIR motif of VHL is essential for LC3B ubiquitination. 
Far UV CD experiments show that Phd52–73Se is intrinsically unstructured in its isolated state but gains an appreciable amount of α-helix upon binding to Doc (Fig. 3).

The action of Doc is suppressed by the antitoxin Phd, which consists of two domains. Its C-terminal domain (residues 52–73) harbors the interaction site with Doc and on its own prevents Doc-mediated growth arrest
Far UV CD experiments show that Phd52–73Se is intrinsically unstructured in its isolated state but gains an appreciable amount of α-helix upon binding to Doc (Fig. 3).
The plateau at I(s)s2 > 0 observed in the Kratky plot (Figure 1D) indicates that Phd is partially unstructured (Pollack et al., 1999; Porod, 1982), in agreement with earlier circular dichroism (CD) studies (Gazit and Sauer, 1999).
 Using the ensemble optimization method (EOM) (Bernado et al., 2007), we find that the scattering curve can be modeled assuming a fixed conformation for residues 1–40 of Phd and a wide structural ensemble for residues 41–73 (c2 = 0.8, Figure 1D, Table S1). 
The amount of secondary structure was estimated from the CD spectrum (20, 21). At 37 °C in buffer alone, Phd seems to be in a largely unfolded, random-coil conformation. However, at 4 °C or at 37 °C in the presence of trimethylamine N-oxide, Phd has a CD spectra indicative of a folded protein containing approximately 45% a-helix (Fig. 1A).
DNA binding induces a dose-dependent increase in Phd structure, suggesting that the folding and site-specific DNA binding of Phd are coupled.
The slope of the initial part of the titration curve shows that the amount of operator DNA needed for induction of fully folded Phd is roughly one-quarter of the protein concentration, suggesting that Phd binds to its operator DNA as a tetramer.
Fig. 5,A and B, show a gel-mobility-shift assay of Phd binding to DNA fragments containing the left and the right operator subsites, respectively. The assays were performed using a DNA concentration low enough (10 pM) to allow the reaction mechanism to be deduced from the dependence of binding on Phd concentration and an equilibrium dissociation constant to be calculated. Two observations suggest that two Phd monomers bind cooperatively to subsite DNA.
DNA binding induces a dose-dependent increase in Phd structure, suggesting that the folding and site-specific DNA binding of Phd are coupled.
When attempting to probe the flexibility of Phd1–57 with hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments, virtually all amide protons exchange within the set-up time (∼11 min) prior to the start of NMR acquisition, and their 1H-15N cross-peaks are therefore absent in the HSQC spectrum. Such dramatic behavior indicates very low stability and lack of conformational rigidity and is presumably the result of a high overall conformational exchange of Phd between folded and partially folded states (See Extended Experimental Procedures for further details).
We used NMR to characterize the structure of the N-terminal domain of Phd (Phd1–57—residues 1–57) in solution. This N-terminal domain of Phd examined by two-dimensional (2D) 1H-15N HSQC NMR is in agreement with a conformationally heterogeneous protein that populates folded and disordered states (Figure S1F, in cyan).
Given the expected elevated conformational heterogeneity of Phd1–57, the 15N transverse and longitudinal relaxation rates (R2 and R1) are the best indicators to probe the state of the Phd1–57 ensemble in solution. Figure 1E shows the R2/R1 ratios along the Phd1–57 sequence (represented as red bars). Two regions show significantly high R2/R1 ratios as a result of elevated R2 rates, indicative of a pronounced conformational freedom and high exchange between different conformational states in the μs to ms timescale. Additionally the C-terminal region displays pronounced low R2/R1 ratios, which indicate an increase in fast dynamics (i.e., high degree of flexibility) in agreement with the heteronuclear NOE values found for this region of the domain (Figure S1G).
In its unbound state Phd is only marginally stable (Figure 2B). 
This indicates a poorly structured unfolding unit, suggesting that, in agreement with the NMR data, the partly unfolded species dominates in solution.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) unfolding data of Phd and its N-terminal fragment Phd1–57 fit well to a two-state model consisting of a dimer unfolding into monomer species. In its unbound state Phd is only marginally stable (Figure 2B).

Our DSC measurements show that binding of DNA or of its toxin partner Doc to Phd significantly increases its thermodynamic stability (Figure 2B, Figure S2C, and Table S2). In both cases the increment in the conformational stability is accompanied by a large increase in the heat of unfolding and the melting temperature of Phd.

In both cases the increment in the conformational stability is accompanied by a large increase in the heat of unfolding and the melting temperature of Phd.
The effect of Doc on the affinity of Phd for a single DNA-binding site (OR1) was quantified using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The affinity of Phd2Doc for OR1 is 0.3 μM, about 10-fold higher than the binding constant of Phd2 for OR1 (Figures 3D and 3E; Table S4).

Phd crystallizes in two different crystal forms. Form I contains a version of the protein that is truncated at Ser58 (hereafter termed Phd1–57). All four molecules in the asymmetric unit adopt a similar, well-folded conformation encompassing Met1-Phe56. This N-terminal domain forms a small globular homodimer comprising a central six-stranded β sheet decorated with four α helices (two from each monomer), resembling the antitoxin YefM (Kamada and Hanaoka, 2005
) (Figure 1A ; Figure S1A available online). The N-terminal α helices α1 and α2 form a large positively charged surface that constitutes the DNA-binding region (Figure S1B). The dimer interface is relatively small (about 900 Å2 of water accessible surface buried per dimer).

The dimer interface is relatively small (about 900 Å2 of water accessible surface buried per dimer).
In this case the disordered nature of the quoted region does not (only) come from missing residues but also from the large differences between the coordinates of the various copies of the protein in the crystal. This shows that some residues have resolved coordinates only because of crystal contacts, and these have been annotated as disordered as well (in line with the authors' assertion).
About 25% of the surface of Doc is buried upon interacting with two Phd dimers (Figure 4B). Site H corresponds to the one identified earlier in the crystal structure of a nontoxic mutant of Doc (Garcia-Pino et al., 2008) and recognizes the Phd segment Phe56-Arg73.
The asymmetric unit of our Phd/Doc cocrystals contains three copies of Phd and one copy of Doc, which through crystal symmetry form a hetero-octameric Phd2-Doc-Phd2-Doc-Phd2 complex (Figure 4A ; Figure S4A).
While the authors do not explicitly state this, the structured state of phd becomes evident when looking at the corresponding complex structure in PDB:3k33.
Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we measured the binding kinetics and affinities for both interaction modes between Phd and Doc (Figure 2C). Consistent with the crystal structure of the complex, the best model that explains the binding data involves two Phd dimers binding to a Doc monomer with affinities of 0.35 μM and 31 μM (Figure 2C; Table S4). 
Doc modulates the affinity of Phd for the operator region of the operon as observed in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Figure 3B). At increasing Doc:Phd ratios between 0 and 1, the band corresponding to unbound DNA disappears and a series of distinct bands appear that we interpret in terms of Phd/Doc/DNA complexes of variable stoichiometry. A first Doc molecule will bridge the two Phd dimers bound to their two sites on the operator DNA and increase affinity through an avidity effect. This interaction will recruit both the high- and low-affinity sites on Doc. A second and third Doc molecule will bind through their high-affinity sites on the two free Phd C termini of the DNA-bound Phd2-Doc-Phd2 complex, resulting in a Doc-Phd2-Doc-Phd2-Doc operator DNA complex.

Our mechanistic model for conditional cooperativity predicts that at saturating levels of Doc, a Doc-Phd2-Doc heterotetrameric complex that is far less capable of repressing the phd/doc operon is formed. We used SAXS to characterize this complex and examine its shape and dimensions. Based on our crystal structure, we constructed a series of alternative Phd/Doc complexes with different stoichiometries (including Phd2-Doc-Phd2, Doc-Phd2-Doc, and the two possible Phd2-Doc architectures). The comparison of the experimental scattering data to the calculated scattering curves derived from these models reveals a close correspondence only to the Doc-Phd2-Doc model and very poor fits to other architectures (Table S1). The Rg (27.5 Å) calculated from the Guinier analysis and the bimodal shape and maximum dimension of the particle (Dmax = 85 Å) obtained from the distance distribution function (P(r)) all agree with our V-shaped model of the Doc-Phd2-Doc complex. Moreover the P(r) function and Kratky plot are consistent with a properly folded, homogeneous, and well-structured species (Figures S4B–S4C).

We further validated the role of site L in autoregulation (again in a nontoxic DocH66Y background) in vivo using a lacZ repression assay and through an indirect toxicity assay that reports the presence of a functional site H (see Extended Experimental Procedures for details). Knocking out site L is expected to result in a Doc phenotype unable to act as corepressor but still capable of binding Phd through site H. As expected, most mutants (R31A, R31D, I35A, R38A, R38D, A61W, A61D, R64E, and R64W) show a decreased corepression activity (Figure 5B; Table S5), remaining, however, capable of displacing wild-type Doc from site H. This effect is severely marked for the mutants R38D and A61D (in agreement with our in vitro results). These site L mutants disrupt the interaction of Phd with Asp53 (in the case of the R38D mutation) or introduce a negative charge in the hydrophobic pocket that accommodates residues Phe56 and Phe60 of Phd (for A61D) and results in a complete loss of corepression. However, their ability to bind Phd through their H site remains intact (Figure 5C; Table S5). Thus the low-affinity interaction that is required to establish a Doc-bridge between two operator-bound Phd dimers is crucial for Doc-mediated enhancement of repression.
DocH66Y was crystallized in complex with a peptide encompassing the C-terminal 22 amino acids of Phd with Se-Met substituted for Leu-52 and Leu-70 (Phd52–73Se). This fragment was chosen based upon previous work that delineates the toxin-binding domain of Phd (14, 15).
Phd52–73Se binds into a groove of DocH66Y of which helix α4 forms the base and that is flanked by helix α1 on one side and the loop α4-α5 on the other side (Fig. 1A).
The PDB shows the antitoxin phd ordered when is bound to Doc.
The C-terminal domain (Ala57-Arg73) of this dimer is also structured due to lattice interactions (Figure 1B; Figure S1D). The conformations adopted by the C terminus are distinct from each other and from the Doc-bound conformations (see below). They contain variable amounts of a helix and likely sample the conformational ensemble of the Phd C-terminal domain in solution.
In this case the disordered nature of the quoted region does not (only) come from missing residues but also from the large differences between the coordinates of the various copies of the protein in the crystal. This shows that some residues have resolved coordinates only because of crystal contacts, and these have been annotated as disordered as well (in line with the authors' assertion).
The PDB shows the antitoxin phd ordered when is bound to Doc.
More significantly, when we map the R2/R1 data on the X-ray structure of Phd (Figure 1F), the “dynamic hot spots” correspond to α helices α2 and α3, two regions that lose structure in the partially disordered conformation observed in the X-ray structure.
This region corresponds to α helix 3.
These site L mutants disrupt the interaction of Phd with Asp53 (in the case of the R38D mutation) or introduce a negative charge in the hydrophobic pocket that accommodates residues Phe56 and Phe60 of Phd (for A61D) and results in a complete loss of corepression. However, their ability to bind Phd through their H site remains intact (Figure 5C; Table S5). Thus the low-affinity interaction that is required to establish a Doc-bridge between two operator-bound Phd dimers is crucial for Doc-mediated enhancement of repression.
There are few NOEs for residues 85–97, which connect helices αD and αE.
This observation suggests that, in the absence of IDR post-translational modifications, the α1-α2 IDR transiently interacts in cis with the folded core of Bcl-xL
(NOE) spectra for Bcl-xL with the S62E phosphomimetic mutation showed that residues within the α1-α2 IDR exhibited reduced flexibility in comparison to wild-type Bcl-xL
the binding of PUMABH3 enhanced the dynamics of the α2-α3 region of BCL-xLΔLΔC.  We directly analyzed polypeptide dynamics on the picosecond-to-nanosecond timescale through measurement of the {1 H}-15N heteronuclear NOE (HetNOE) for backbone amide groups. The binding of PUMABH3 substantially enhanced dynamics
within BCL-xLΔLΔC.
Central in this regulation is an EcMazE-induced double conformational change as follows: a rearrangement of a crucial active site loop and a relative rotation of the two monomers in the EcMazF dimer. Both are induced by the C-terminal residues Asp-78–Trp-82 of EcMazE, which are also responsible for strong negative cooperativity in EcMazE-EcMazF binding
Substrate Binding Folds an Otherwise Disordered Substratebinding Loop of EcMazF. Most loop regions are well structured, with exception of loops 1-2 (residues Asp-16– Arg-29) and 4-5 (residues Leu-64–Gly-71) (Fig. 1C).

Both EcMazF and BsMazF only adapt a catalytically competent conformation for loop 1-2 when a substrate or substrate mimic is bound (27). In both enzymes, the antitoxin also prevents loop 1-2 from adopting this conformation. 
Ordering of the loops occurs only upon binding the substrate, bringing about the catalytically active form
Akt2 residues omitted from the model because of disorder include the N-terminal residues 143–145, residues 190–201 of α helix C, residues 298–310 of the activation loop, and C-terminal residues 441–481.
In all three crystal forms of PKB, a contiguous region of the activation segment (residues 297 to 312) located between the invariant DFG and APE motifs, and including (p)Thr 309, is disordered.
Moreover, in these structures, electron density for residues C-terminal to Asp 441 is not visible, suggesting that they are conformational disordered. However, in the ΔPH-PKB structure, which contains a nonphosphorylated hydrophobic motif and therefore retains the potential to interact with the N lobe, we are also unable to detect visible electron density for residues C-terminal to Asp 441, indicating that the hydrophobic motif is mobile.

Activation of PKB by Ser 474 phosphorylation occurs via a mechanism involving a disorder to order transition of the αC helix of the N-terminal lobe, induced by the association of a phosphorylated hydrophobic motif, with concomitant ordering and restructuring of the activation segment and alignment of catalytic site residues.
Phosphorylation of Ser 474 augments the activity of PDK1-phosphorylated PKB by 7- to 10-fold (Alessi et al., 1996), such that phosphorylation of both residues results in greater than 1000-fold increased protein kinase activity.
The site of C-terminal regulatory phosphorylation of PKB (Ser 474) is within a hydrophobic sequence motif (F-x-x-F-[S/T]-Y), conserved within a large proportion of AGC kinases Keranen et al. 1995, Pearson et al. 1995.

There were notable gaps in the electron density for the N- and C-termini, within the L3 loop (between residues R280-V292 with small variations in the different structures), and for the linker region between the protease and PDZ domains (G345-S357) common for all the structures described in this work.

The high R factor and R free are consistent with a large extent of disorder (23 residues of 80). There is sufficient volume to accommodate these missing residues (seven at the N-terminus and 16 at the C-terminus) in the crystal lattice.
The first seven N-terminal residues, including two plasmid-encoded residues and residues 487-491, and the C-terminal residues 549-564 are disordered.
As expected, the electron density of the solvent-exposed flexible RCL (Ser331–Pro349) is missing and reflects the ability of the RCL to adopt different conformations suitable for the interaction with target proteases (10).
The numbering of the IDR that includes the reactive center loop (RCL) of PAI-1, corresponds to region 355-370 of the associated UniProt sequence, since PDB:3Q02 spans residues 24-402 of the protein.
Dashed lines indicate disordered residues in the reactive center loop (RCL) of PAI-1 and residues leading to the RGD sequence of somatomedin B.
The final model includes residues 6–337 and 348–379 of PAI-1 and 3–39 of SMB.

Most residues in the Pim-1 structures are well resolved, except for the N-terminal residues 14–31 and the C-terminal residues 309–313.
Three regions were not modeled because of poor electron density: the first seven residues at the N-terminus, the last 16 residues at the C-terminus and the internal linker residues Arg92–Leu102. These regions were disordered in the original 1.75 and 1.9 Å structures (35,36) and they remained uninterpretable even in the present high resolution analysis.

The disordered region is positioned between two RRM domains.

Second, the linker connecting the two RRMs becomes ordered on TR2 binding (Fig. 2A).
Both regions make important contacts with DNA (see below).
The inter-RRM linker segment is defined to include amino acids 90–105. Three residues in this segment make direct contacts with DNA bases. Arg-92 makes contacts with three bases, Gua-4, Gua-5, and Thy-7, and the guanidino moiety is locked between the three bases (Fig.4 and 5A). Ser-95 makes a hydrogen bond with the N2 atom of Gua-4. The imidazole ring of His-101 stacks with the purine ring of Ade-3, which is sandwiched between His-101 and Phe-17.

Second, the linker connecting the two RRMs becomes ordered on TR2 binding (Fig. 2A).
Third, the region near the carboxyl terminus of UP1 (Lys-183–Ser-190), which was disordered in the absence of DNA, also becomes ordered in the presence of DNA and forms an α-helix (Fig. 2A).
The segment including residues 183–190 was disordered in the protein-only structure, but becomes ordered and forms an α-helix when bound to DNA. The amide group of Lys-183 makes a hydrogen bond with Gua-11, and its side chain interacts with the DNA backbone via a water-mediated interaction. Met-186 makes a van der Waals contact with Ade-9, such that the adenine ring is sandwiched between Met-186 and Phe-108.
Although the coil regions lack rigid secondary structures, they orderly stack along the fibril axis to enhance the stability of each protofilament (Fig. 2b, c).

The nuclear localization sequence mediates hnRNPA1 amyloid fibril formation revealed by cryoEM structure
The low complexity (LC) domain of hnRNPA1 drives both dynamic phase separation and amyloid aggregation.
Based on the high-resolution cryoEM density map, we were able to unambiguously build an atomic structure model for hnRNPA1 LC fibril (Fig. 1d). Despite that the fibrils were formed by hnRNPA1 residues 186–320, only residues 251–295 were involved in the fibril core (Fig. 1d).
The region is missing in the crystal structure but it was not mentioned in the article.
The Kapβ2-M9NLS crystals contain a Kapβ2 mutant with a truncated H8 loop bound to residues 257–305 of hnRNP A1 (Figure 1B).
Karyopherinβ (Kapβ) proteins bind nuclear localization and export signals (NLSs and NESs) to mediate nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, a process regulated by Ran GTPase through its nucleotide cycle.
Electrostatic modulation of hnRNPA1 low-complexity domain liquid–liquid phase separation and aggregation
The intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain (CTD) of hnRNPA1 mediates both dynamic liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) and aggregation.
We demonstrate that the CTD undergoes electrostatic-mediated LLPS and that pH modulates phase separation thresholds, and aggregation propensity and kinetics of hnRNPA1CTD droplets.
hnRNPA1CTD LLPS is modulated by pH, and protein, salt and RNA concentrations

The intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain (CTD) of hnRNPA1 mediates both dynamic liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) and aggregation.
We demonstrate that the CTD undergoes electrostatic-mediated LLPS and that pH modulates phase separation thresholds, and aggregation propensity and kinetics of hnRNPA1CTD droplets.
While examining hnRNPA1CTD LLPS properties, we observed that reversible droplet assembly was accompanied by the formation of protein aggregates within a few hours in most of our experimental conditions.
Only mutation of Lys183 among the three lysines (Lys166, Lys179 and Lys183) between amino acid residues 161 and 185 resulted in a decreased level of hnRNP A1 ubiquitylation (Supplementary information, Figure S3D).
In addition, mutation at Lys298 but not Lys277 at the C-terminus of hnRNP A1 also reduced hnRNP A1 ubiquitylation dramatically (Supplementary information, Figure S3B and S3D).
IP-western blot revealed that hnRNP-A1 phosphorylation at SQ/TQ motifs was reduced in S95A and S192A single mutant hnRNP-A1 and was eliminated in S95A/S192A double mutant hnRNP-A1 as compared to wild-type hnRNP-A1 (Figure 1C). These results confirm that Ser95 and Ser192 are main phosphorylation residues of hnRNP-A1 and that hnRNP-A1 is phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs in vivo (13,21).
at all temperatures and
hydration conditions, the quasielastic intensity of CAS is higher
than that in GFP, suggesting that the IDP shows higher
flexibility and enhanced picosecond dynamics relative to the
rigid β-barrel
We show that CAS partially folds and stiffens upon calcium binding, but in the unfolded state, it is softer than folded proteins such as green fluorescence protein (GFP).
An IDP, β-casein
(CAS), has been studied in a calcium bound and unbound
state using neutron and light scattering techniques.
The purified proteins were concentrated to 15 mg/ml and subjected to standard one dimensional proton NMR.
The narrow spread of the peptide backbone amide NH peaks (7.8–8.6 ppm) and the side chain NH peaks (6.6–7.4 ppm) are indicative of a lack of ordered structures over the NMR time scale.
Therefore, both BSP and OPN, when purified and isolated in solution, are flexible along their entire length and have no significant regions that persist in a single structural environment for more than a few milliseconds.
For example, we have shown previously that BSP can bind strongly to hydroxyapatite (HA) and does so throughout most of its entire length. For BSP to function as an attachment protein for cells to attach to HA (as has been frequently proposed by people in the bone field), the BSP would be bound to HA along its length and yet keep its RGD domain available to bind an integrin such as aVb3.
BSP can also bind first to the alpha-V/beta-3 integrin then it can bind to complement
Factor H (Fig. 3A). This four-subunit complex stops the lytic pathway of complement in vitro (10). If, however, Factor H binds to BSP before the latter can bind to its integrin, the Factor H binds throughout the length of BSP blocking its ability to subsequently bind to the integrin. The integrin-binding domain of BSP can therefore bind to either the integrin or to specific portions of Factor H.
RGD domain available to bind an integrin such as alpha-V/beta-3
 Furthermore, preincubation of MEL cells with either GRGDS peptide or an aVb3 antibody (which blocks that integrins binding activity) negated the protective effect of rBSP.
Preincubation  of  MEL  cells  with  rBSP whose  RGD  sequence  had  been  mutated  to  KAE  completely removed the protective affects of this protein.
By steady state fluorescence, the binding of BSP  and  OPN  by  Factor  H  are  saturable  and  possess  a  1:1 stoichiometry, have binding constants in the nanomolar range, given the serum concentration of Factor H (0.5 mg/ml), virtually all BSP and OPN in serum will be complexed with Factor H.
BSP has long been known to have an affinity for hydroxyapatite. A UMR-BSP hydroxyapaptite dissociation constant of 2.6 3 1029 M was calculated utilizing a molecular weight of 67.9 kD and a modification of the Scatchard method.
A 59 amino acid recombinant RGD domain was produced in minimal media using 15NH4Cl as the sole source of nutrient nitrogen. The HSQC two-dimensional
NMR spectrum showed a narrow spread of chemical shifts characteristic of a flexible structure or “random coil.”
However, unlike the other recombinant BSP proteins, both the normal 258E–317Q
(RGD) protein and the mutant 258E–317Q (KAE) protein mediated cell attachment were affected by the addition of GRGDS peptide.
It is clear from the authors' description that with this mutation they tested the integrin binding ability. While the whole protein retained cell attachment ability in the presence of the mutations (it also has another, integrin-independent attachment site), the cell attachment ability of the C-terminal segment was sensitive for the presence of competeing RGD-containing peptides.
Thus, BSP is a protein that can be bound along most of its length separately to at least two different binding partners in vivo. The simplest way to do this is to have a completely unstructured protein essentially alternating sequences that can specifically interact with the different binding partners.
BSP can also bind first to the avb3 integrin then it can bind to complement Factor H. This four-subunit complex stops the lytic pathway of complement in vitro.
Results revealed a MW of 40 634 Da which based on the sequence of human CRT (and thepresence of four additional amino acid residues at the N-terminus, see Experimental Procedures) can be most closely correlated with the cleavage of 51 residues from the C-terminus of the protein. Collectively, these findings are entirely consistent with the presence of a region at the C-terminus of CRT in which the polypeptide backbone is most exposed and conformationally flexible in solution andtherefore more susceptible to proteolysis by thermolysin.

These calculations yielded a value of f / f0) 1.65 using a partial specific volume of 0.695 cm3/g and hydration of 0.502 g of H2O/g of protein. Using these values, CRT could be  represented  as  a  prolate  of  ellipsoid  of  revolution  with an apparent axial ratio of 12.2, having a length of 29.8 nm and a diameter of 2.44 nm (Table 1). Based on this model, the  hydrodynamic  dimensions  clearly  indicate  that  monomeric CRT is an asymmetric elongated molecule in solution.
The distinctively  nonspherical  shape  of  CRT  is consistent  with  secondary  structure  predictions  suggesting that  certain  regions  of  the  protein  are  likely  to  adopt  an extended conformation in solution ( 17, 44 ).
Sedimentation equilibrium and velocity experiments clearly established  that  this  anomalous  behavior  arises  from  the highly elongated shape of monomeric CRT.
This analysis reveals that proteolytic fragments corresponding to bands 1 and 2 share a common core region  that  includes  most  of  the  N-domain  (residues  60 180) and a major portion of the P-domain (residues 180  226), emphasizing that this region of the protein adopts a stable  and  rigid  three-dimensional  structure  in  solution.
N-domain of CRT is likely to fold into a globular structure within the protein   (17,   44),   thus conferring increased protection against proteolysis. The single site of thermolytic cleavage identified in the  N-domain  is  at  position  Leu  60(Table  2)  and is likely  to be  located  in  a  more  surface-exposed region, such as a loop or a turn, within the spatial arrangement of this domain.
The analysis presented in Figure 6 also indicates that band3 corresponds to the P-domain of CRT and encompasses the type 1 and type 2 sequence motifs (17, 44) which have been suggested to be important for the lectin function of CRT (7,18). The presence of this fragment in the proteolytic mixture provides  evidence  that  isolated  domains  of  CRT  can  be independently  stable  in  solution
Collectively, these studies provide experimental evidence that support  and  extend  the  early  structural  characterization  of CRT which predicted from secondary structure analysis that the general shape of the protein is a large globular N-terminus region  followed  by  a  more  elongated  C-terminal  region ( 17, 44 ).
Results (Table 2) indicate that two of the fragments (bands 1 and 2) are characterized by extensive loss of residues at the C-terminus of the protein but more limited cleavage at the  N-terminus
This observation suggests that the C-domain may be an important determinant in  initiating  the  thermal  denaturation  of  CRT  and  also  supports the view that this domain is likely to adopt a more loosely  packed  conformation  in  solution  ( 17,  44 ).  Collectively, these studies provide experimental evidence that support  and  extend  the  early  structural  characterization  of CRT which predicted from secondary structure analysis that the general shape of the protein is a large globular N-terminus region  followed  by  a  more  elongated  C-terminal  region ( 17, 44 ). 
Interestingly,  results  from Figure 5 (lane at 50°C) indicate that fragments lacking the C-domain   (e.g.,   bands   1-3)   exhibit   increased   thermals tability in comparison to full-length CRT. This observation suggests that the C-domain may be an important determinant in  initiating  the  thermal  denaturation  of  CRT  and  also supports the view that this domain is likely to adopt a moreloosely  packed  conformation  in  solution
Based on its elution position corresponding to that of a globular protein of MW 158 kDa (Figure 1A), the Stokes radius of CRT was calculated to be 46.2 Å (see Experimental Procedures). This value is considerably larger than the calculated value of 29.4 Å assuming CRT to be a monomeric globular protein in solution (see Experimental Procedures). The experimentally determined Stokes radius of 46.2 Å is, however, significantly different from the calculated value of 64.2 Å assuming CRT to be completely unfolded in solution
Consequently, the apparent large size of CRT determined on the gel filtration column is more likely to be accounted for on the basis of its intrinsic molecular properties such as the presence of partly denatured regions, a welldefined oligomeric state in solution, an asymmetric shape, or a combination of these factors.
Our results from gel filtration chromatography indicate that CRT elutes at a position corresponding to a significantly larger size based on calibration of the column using globular protein standards.
Taken together, the CD analysis suggests that although the three-dimensional structure of CRT is overall characterized by well-packed side chains, as evidenced by the pronounced near-UV CD spectrum and the cooperative nature of the thermal denaturation transitions, the relatively low Tm values suggest a marginally stable core structure.
LIR motifs of known autophagy receptors and adaptors feature mATG8 specificity.
A high number of autophagy receptors or adaptor structures have been reported, yet the basis for their selective interaction with individual members of the ATG8 family is not well understood. We speculated whether the LIR motif alone is able to confer selectivity towards a mATG8 subfamily and whether we could derive a subfamily consensus motif from analysis of known mATG8 interaction partners. To address this question, we screened an array of peptides (presented in Fig EV1A and described in Materials and Methods) with the LIR sequences of 30 known and validated autophagy receptors and adaptors (Table 1) against all six human mATG8s for binding (Figs 1A and EV1B and C). In brief, biotinylated peptides were immobilized on streptavidin‐coated 96‐well plates and incubated with His6‐tagged mATG8 proteins. After washing steps, peptide‐bound mATG8 was detected in an ELISA reader using anti‐His antibodies directly conjugated to HRP (horse radish peroxidase; Fig EV1A).
The annotated region include the LIR motif (WDFL) at position 200-203.

Immunocytochemical localization studies in fixed NEURO-2a (N2a) cells showed that both proteins partially colocalize, or at least are not visibly separated, in different cellular compartments (Fig. 6). In addition to the reported cytosolic appearance of both GABARAP and CRT [[4, 18]], these results indicate the possibility for direct interaction.

Indeed, Sepharose-immobilized GABARAP was found to interact with endogenous CRT from brain extracts (Fig. 7A). By contrast, Sepharose without immobilized GABARAP, but otherwise identically treated, did not show CRT immunoreactivity.
Figure 7 GABARAP associates with CRT. (A) Endogenous CRT binds to immobilized GABARAP. Control Sepharose alone (lane 2) and Sepharose-coupled GABARAP in the presence (lane 3) and absence (lane 4) of 1150 µm N1 were exposed to rat brain extracts. After extensive washing, bound material was resolved by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunoblotting with anti-CRT serum. Control Sepharose (lane 2) shows no indication for binding, whereas Sepharose-coupled GABARAP exhibits immunoreactivity for CRT. Only very weak immunoreactivity was observed in the presence of N1 peptide (lane 4). For convenience, lane 1 shows the bands of a prestained protein marker (Prestained Protein Marker, Broad Range, NEB, Beverly, MA, USA). (B) Endogenous GABARAP binds to immobilized CRT. Control Sepharose (lane 2) and Sepharose-coupled CRT were exposed to rat brain extracts. After extensive washing, bound material was resolved by SDS-PAGE and analysed by immunoblotting with anti-GABARAP serum. Two signals with GABARAP immunoreactivity are clearly visible.
The interaction of CRT and GABARAP was further confirmed by a pull-down experiment of endogenous GABARAP with recombinant CRT immobilized on NHS-activated Sepharose (CRT-Sepharose). CRT-Sepharose was exposed to rat brain extracts, and CRT-Sepharose-associated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed by western blot analysis for GABARAP immunoreactivity. Sepharose-immobilized CRT was found to interact with endogenous GABARAP from brain extracts (Fig. 7B). 
SPR was used to investigate quantitatively the interaction of recombinant GABARAP with recombinant CRT. GABARAP was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip using standard amine coupling procedures. The injection of CRT on the sensor chip resulted in binding to GABARAP, as indicated by an injection time-dependent increase in the SPR response. Dissociation of bound CRT from the sensor chip was very slow, indicating a very low dissociation rate of CRT from GABARAP. Apart from a small change in the bulk refractive index during injection, no interaction of CRT with the reference surface was observed.
1H–15N correlation NMR (heteronuclear single quantum correlation, HSQC) spectra of GABARAP labelled with the stable isotope 15N were recorded during the course of titration with unlabelled CRT. The NMR spectrum of GABARAP without CRT exhibited the known and expected resonances typical for natively folded GABARAP [[22]]. The addition of CRT to GABARAP resulted in the disappearance of GABARAP resonances, a clear indication of binding (Fig. 3B). 
These results indicate that nuclear export mediated by CRT requires specific recognition of the NES within PKI. 
Taken together, our data indicate that CRT and Ran cooperate to mediate nuclear export of PKI, and that this pathway involves CRT recognition of the leucine-rich NES of PKI. These properties are consistent with CRT functioning as a nuclear export receptor for PKI.
Thus, CRT and Ran exhibit cooperative binding to the NES. The binding of CRT and Ran in this reaction is specific for a WT NES, since addition of these proteins to a surface containing a mutant NES did not cause a detectable increase in refractive index (light blue tracing).
Interestingly, the mapping studies revealed other unique C1q binding sites in the CRT sequence of a non-CH2-like nature; a site in the N-domain of CRT (peptides 35−40, Figure 1B) was observed to bind to C1q encompassing the amino acids TDMHGDSEYNIMFGPDICGPGTKKVHV (amino acids 103−129). The peptide 51 corresponding to the amino acid sequence FTHLYTLIVRPDNTY (amino acids 150−165) also demonstrated strong binding to C1q. As shown in Figure 2, a non-CH2-like region peptide present in the P-domain (peptide 79−82), WEPPVIQNPEYKGEWKPR (amino acids 244−261), bound to C1q in addition to the CH2-like domain present in the P-domain, WDERAKID.
The region 244−261, mentioned by the authors, corresponds to the 261-278 region of the full protein.

Multiple medium and long-range NOEs were observed for most residues between Glu25 and Tyr104, with gaps falling mainly between the elements of secondary structure.
Few long-range NOEs arising from the residues prior to Glu25 were detected, suggesting that this N-terminal segment of the protein is unlikely to interact extensively with the remainder of the MDM2N domain. The exception is Ile19, which exhibits NOEs to His96, Arg97 and Tyr100 in the N-terminal part of α2′. The measurable heteronuclear (1H,15N) NOEs (Figure 2(a)) are indeed negative or very small for N-terminal residues (Met6–Val8, The10–Val14), and T2 values are elevated (Figure 2(b)), consistent with the presence of fast (picosecond to nanosecond timescale) motion in this region.
Here, we compared spectral resolution and sensitivity for 2D 1H-15N and 13C-15N correlation spectra recorded through direct detection of each of the two correlated nuclei for two protein regions that are entirely disordered (Hdm2-ABD and Surf6-N) and 2D 1H-15N correlation spectra for a ~73 kDa folded, pentameric protein with two short IDRs (N130).
The sequence of residues 137-152 (not visible in the electron density maps) is particularly rich in glycines
Figure 2a and b shows a topology diagram and a ribbon representation of the subunit which consists of a polypeptide chain of 152 amino acid residues; the first 136 of these are visible in the crystal structure. 
The 1H – 15N HSQC spectrum of colicin E9 (Figure 5) has a relatively narrow 1H chemical shift dispersion for the majority of signals, typical of that for a largely unstructured protein
The N-terminal region of colicin E9 is largely unstructured and flexible
chemical shift differences between the Ca, Cb and 13CO resonances of colicin E9 and those of sequence-corrected random coil values suggest that some of the residues in the N-terminal
region of the colicin are not in random coil conformations (Figure 8). The majority of peaks have
low-frequency Ca, Cb and 13CO shifts, indicating a preference for populating the b-region of (phi,psi) space, which is normal for random polypeptide chains.
the data presented here show that colicin E9 has a largely unstructured translocation domain without regular secondary structure, and thus it is not a molten globule
Most of the signals of the T1−61 region of the fusion protein had similar chemical shifts to those of intact colicin E9, with chemical shift differences from the sequence-corrected random coil values indicating that it lacked any stable secondary or tertiary structure.
Finally, we report the structure of the OmpF- OBS1 complex that shows the colicin bound within the porin lumen spanning the membrane bilayer. Our study explains how colicins exploit porins to deliver epitope signals to the bacterial periplasm and, more broadly, how the inherent flexibility and narrow cross-sectional area of an IUP domain can endow it with the ability to traverse a biological membrane via the constricted lumen of a β-barrel membrane protein
the most important factors in colicin translocation are the flexibility of the polypeptide backbone and the unconstrained nature of the N terminus.
We can now add a further advantage IUPs have over their globular counterparts that centers on their flexibility and lack of structure, characteristics that allow them to traverse a membrane through the narrow channels of a protein pore in order to deliver a signal directly into a cell. The key to this transfer is the intrinsically unstructured nature of an IUP and its narrow cross-sectional area, properties that allow a macromolecule as big as 6,000 Da to pass through a protein pore that has a molecular weight cutoff filter of 600 Da.
The disordered character may also be derived from the fact that each of the 6 copies show different conformations – these are probably induced by the fuzzy interaction.
detecting binding through isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (see Fig. S2 and Table S1 for details). We narrowed down the main OmpF-binding site to a 17-residue epitope from the N terminus of the ColE9 IUTD (residues 2–18), for which a peptide encompassing this sequence bound OmpF with a Kd of approximately 2 μM and a stoichiometry of one colicin peptide/OmpF monomer
We denote this IUTD binding epitope as OmpF-Binding Site 1 (OBS1). The interaction of the OBS1 peptide with OmpF is characterized by a large and favorable enthalpy (ΔH = −19.1 kcal∕mol) and an unfavorable entropy change (ΔS = −37.8 cal∕mol/K), consistent with the disordered peptide becoming ordered upon complex formation.
Delineation of OBS2 was confirmed through ITC experiments using a synthetic peptide of residues 54 to 63 of the ColE9 IUTD binding to OmpF (Fig. 1B). Although OBS2 binds 10-fold weaker to OmpF than OBS1 (Kd 1⁄4 24 μM) the thermodynamic parameters of complex formation are similar to those of OBS1 (Table S1). Importantly, when OmpF was incubated with an excess of the OBS1 peptide, OBS2 was no longer able to bind OmpF, suggest- ing the two ColE9 IUTD OmpF-binding sites associate with the same region on the porin (Fig. 1B).
ColE9 yet further, bound TolB with the same equilibrium dissociation constant as intact colicin (Kd = 1 uM) and with very similar thermodynamic parameters. ITC data for Tpep32–47 binding TolB are shown in Fig. 5b and compared with wild-type ColE9 in Table 1. The data show that complex formation is enthalpically driven and has a negative entropy, which is typical of binding-induced disorder–order transitions of natively disordered proteins.
MBP-labeled ColE9 mutants could be readily crosslinked to TolB, but surprisingly these were distributed on either side of the previously identified TolB box sequence, appearing instead to form a photocrosslink footprint that spanned residues 34–46
the structure of the ColE9 Tpep32–47–TolB complex was solved to a resolution of 2.0 Å
ColE9 Tpep32–47 binds to the ‘‘top’’ side of the B-propeller domain, distal to the N-terminal domain, with 15 of the 16 residues (32–46) contacting TolB.
 a reduction in the backbone segmental motions of the residues giving rise to the signals, and TolB- induced chemical shift changes together with intermediate exchange between free and bound colicin E9. Whichever is the most important mechanism, the NMR data (Figure 11) identify clearly that residues 33 – 44 of colicin E9 are affected by the inter- action with TolB.
In order to define this common binding site we crystallized OmpF in the presence of the higher affinity OBS1 peptide, the resulting crystals diffracting to 3.0-Å resolution. The monoclinic asymmetric unit contained two OmpF trimers and the electron density maps revealed electron density in the lumen of all six OmpF molecules, indicating the presence of the OBS1 peptide.
ColE9 yet further, bound TolB with the same equilibrium dissociation constant as intact colicin (Kd = 1 uM) and with very similar thermodynamic parameters.

We find that the conformational fluctuations of the interdomain linker, which are largely responsible for the overall interdomain motions of CaM, can be well described by exploiting the information provided by chemical shifts
In aqueous solution, the CD spectra of  both HlyA and LktA reflect a predominantly  random conformation (Figures 6 and 7). There is no observed structural change between 23 and 37 “C. A broad range of pH changes (pH 4.5-8) do not affect the structure of  either HlyA or LktA signal  peptide.
The C-terminal signal peptides of HlyA and LktA exhibit similar biophysical behaviors. In aqueous solution, both molecules are mainly in a random conformation.
Finally, we tested the conformational behaviors of HlyA and LktA  signal peptides in phospholipid vesicles,  a  lipid bilayer environment which more closely resembles a membrane  compared to the  other  reagents  tested.   Uncharged phospholipids  PC  could not induce an ordered  structure (Figure 7G,H), while  the  anionic  phospholipids  (PS,  PG) induced formation of a-helices in both peptides (Figure 7C- F).

This confirms that these  short  sequences  contain  information sufficient  for  recognition and transport, and  that no other sequences  are  required.
In order to test the secretion of these signal peptides, C-HA61 or C-LA70 were coexpressed with the transporter proteins HlyB and HlyD in JM83 cells. Cell media were taken at different points during the growth curve. The secreted signal peptides can be detected by Western blot analysis using C494 antibody. As shown in Figure 3 lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8, signal sequence peptides of HlyA and LktA were found in the medium. This secretion requires the presence of both HlyB and HlyD.
Thus, these data show that the signal sequence bearing peptides can be transported by the HlyB/D transporter in a specific manner.
Signal peptides were labelled with 15N to facilitate the NMR analysis. A striking feature of the NMR spectra of both is the poor dispersion in the 1H nuclei, possibly indicating the presence of a significant amount of random-coil or unfolded protein conformation [27]. The 15N-nuclei, on the other hand, have reasonable chemical shift dispersion as has been shown previously for this nucleus in unfolded proteins [28,29].
Both peptides contained two regions with NMR parameters that are characteristic of a-helices (Fig. 1). Typical helical NOEs were observed for residues 31-43 and 56-66 of LktA.
Using EPR approach, we investigated the structure of isolated Ure2p prion domain in the construct of Ure2p1–89-M, which is tethered on solid support to prevent protein aggregation. We showed that the pattern of site-specific spin label mobility remains unchanged when the buffer is changed from a strong denaturing buffer to a native buffer, suggesting that the structure of Ure2p1–89-M is completely disordered.
The assignment of the proton, nitrogen, and carbon resonances of Tβ4 free in solution were obtained using standard procedures. The HSQC spectrum of Tβ4 in solution is typical of an unfolded protein, with a very narrow range of amide proton resonances. NOE correlations for all residues along segment 5-16 indicates that this part of the protein folds as a α-helix.
The small negative Hα and positive Cα shifts relative to the random coil shifts observed for residues 31-37 suggest that this segment has a weak tendency to fold into an α-helix. 
The large dispersion of amide proton resonances in the bound form (to CaATP-actin) is typical of a fully structured protein.
The large spreading of all resonances of Tβ4 testifies that at 25 °C, Tβ4 forms a tight complex with G-actin, in which the environment of all residues of the peptide is drastically modified, either by folding or by making contacts with G-actin.
The spectrum of free thymosin beta4 is dominated by the deep trough at 200 nm indicating that thymosin beta4 is predominantly in a random coil conformation.  The nonzero value at 222 nm indicates that part of the structure may not be an ideal random coil.
The CD spectrum of thymosin â4 was also measured in the presence of equimolar actin.
The thymosin beta4 spectrum indicated a predominantly random coil structure, but the increased depth of the trough at 222 nm indicated the formation of some additional ordered structure upon binding actin.
One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of free thymosin beta4 showed narrow line widths and low dispersion, and are consistent with a predominantly random coil structure which is highly mobile on the NMR time scale.
The spectrum of thymosin beta4 bound to actin, after subtraction of the actin signal, is very similar to
the spectrum of free thymosin beta4.
Overall, the published spectroscopic results and those presented above suggest that in the actin-Tß4 complex, up to 12 residues of thymosin beta4, possibly residues 5-16, are in an alpha-helical conformation, while the rest of the peptide is predominantly in a random coil conformation.
CP12 is an 8.5-kDa nuclear-encoded chloroplast protein, isolated from higher plants. It forms part of a core complex of two dimers of phosphoribulokinase (PRK), two tetramers of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and CP12. Oxidized, but not reduced, CP12 acts as a linker in the assembly of the complex. Reduced CP12 is mainly unstructured

Low {1H}–15N het-NOE values (< 0.4), typical of a disordered linker between globular domains, are observed for residues A51–D60
the N-terminal region is unstable, oscillates at the ms timescale between helical and random conformations, and is connected through a disordered linker to its C-terminus, which forms a stable helical turn.
In C. reinhardtii, the reduction/oxidation regulation of CP12 is mediated via its four cysteine residues, which are involved into two disulfide bridges under oxidized state (C23–C31 and C66–C75) [28]. The disorder to order transition induced by formation of these disulfide bridges endows CP12 with the same peculiar properties as other IDPs named conditionally disordered proteins.
The most drastic differences are in the C-terminal region L62–Y78, indicating that oxidation triggered the folding of this region. The Cα chemical shifts of this region indicate a helical formation.
Bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria are potent antimicrobial compounds which are active against closely related bacteria. Producer strains are protected against the effects of their cognate bacteriocins by immunity proteins. However, to date, no structures are available for the corresponding immunity proteins. We report here the NMR solution structure of the 111-amino acid immunity protein for carnobacteriocin B2 (ImB2).
Most of the charged and polar residues in the protein face the solvent. Helix 3 is well-defined to residue 55, and a stretch of nascent helix followed by an unstructured loop joins it to helix 4. The loop between helices 3 and 4, and a hydrophobic pocket which it partially masks, may be important for interaction with membrane receptors responsible for sensitivity to class IIa bacteriocins
Amide cross-peaks were broad and weak for residues 56, 58, 65, 66, 69, and 73 and either overlapped or missing for residues 62, 63, 67, 68, and 74 in 15N HSQC spectra. Some of the side chain 1 H-13C cross-peaks for these residues were also not observed in 13C HSQC spectra. Side chain assignments for residues 55, 59, 62, 67, 68, and 71 were partially determined. Higher temperature (28 °C vs 15 °C) resulted in further broadening of the amide cross-peaks in this region and allowed even fewer assignments to be made. Only intraresidue or i + 1 NOEs were observed for 10 of the 20 amino acid residues in this small section of the protein, which is relatively unstructured and forms a conformationally flexible section (see below).

Because of a lack of NOE data, helix 3 is well defined until only S55 (see below). The nascent helical structure in this region may be forming and dissociating on the NMR time scale, resulting in averaging of chemical shifts and broad peaks that cannot be observed

As mentioned above, helix 3 is well-defined to residue S55, and NOEs indicative of helical structure are observed to residue I58. From residues 58-71, a relatively unstructured loop is apparent. Data indicate a nascent helix structure can be present up to residue 64. This region may be important for binding a putative receptor in the cell membrane (see below).
The spectra are very similar and are dominated by the minimum at around 200 nm, which is indicative of polypeptides with significant nonordered structure.
Figure 6 shows that in the absence of TMAO the AhR−AB polypeptide is extremely sensitive to digestion with chymotrypsin with no clear ladder of fragments observed and no full-length polypeptide remaining after 5 min.
 After excitation at 278 nm, the main features observed are a λmax for tryptophan emission at 344 nm (average of 343 ± 2 nm, n = 7) and a shoulder at 307 nm for tyrosine (Figure 4A).
The emission spectra for the soluble and refolded AhR TAD polypeptides were essentially indistinguishable (Figure 4B) (see also below). Taken together, these results suggest that removal of the denaturant, urea, leads to folding of the AhR−AB polypeptide into a relatively open conformation that is intrinsic to the polypeptide and not a consequence of the purification process.
Figure 2 (panels A and B) confirms the interaction with the TBP and also shows interactions with TAF4 and TAF6, other components of the TFIID complex.
Virtually the same levels of TBP binding were observed no matter the method of AhR−AB purification (Figure 2C).
In aqueous solution, the CD spectra of  both HlyA and LktA reflect a predominantly  random conformation (Figures 6 and 7). There is no observed structural change between 23 and 37 “C. A broad range of pH changes (pH 4.5-8) do not affect the structure of  either HlyA or LktA signal  peptide.
The C-terminal signal peptides of HlyA and LktA exhibit similar biophysical behaviors. In aqueous solution, both molecules are mainly in a random conformation.
Signal peptides were labelled with 15N to facilitate the NMR analysis. A striking feature of the NMR spectra of both is the poor dispersion in the 1H nuclei, possibly indicating the presence of a significant amount of random-coil or unfolded protein conformation [27]. The 15N-nuclei, on the other hand, have reasonable chemical shift dispersion as has been shown previously for
this nucleus in unfolded proteins [28,29].
The NMR evidence for the helices in HIyA is not as strong as for LktA, presumably due to instability of the helices. Residues 1-34, 47-56 and 68-83 have for the most part random coil Halpha chemical shifts, 3J(NH-Halpha) values between 6-8 Hz and only short-range sequential NOEs (i, i+1 and i, i+2).
In order to test the secretion of these signal peptides, C-HA61 or C-LA70 were coexpressed with the transporter proteins HlyB and HlyD in JM83 cells. Cell media were taken at different points during the growth curve. The secreted signal peptides can be detected by Western blot
analysis using C494 antibody. As shown in Figure 3 lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8, signal sequence peptides of HlyA and LktA were found in the medium. This secretion requires the
presence of both HlyB and HlyD.
Thus, these data show that the signal sequence bearing peptides can be transported by the HlyB/D transporter in a specific manner.
This confirms that these short sequences contain information sufficient for recognition and transport, and that no other sequences are required.
Finally, we tested the conformational behaviors of HlyA and LktA signal peptides in phospholipid vesicles, a lipid bilayer environment which more closely resembles a membrane compared to the other reagents tested. Uncharged phospholipids PC could not induce an ordered structure (Figure 7G,H), while the anionic phospholipids (PS, PG) induced formation of a-helices in both peptides (Figure 7C- F).

Switch B (578–591), which lies between switch C and the nucleotide substrate, becomes disordered when CaM is not present. This disorder cannot be attributed to the lack of substrate in the EF-alone structure, because switch B is clearly visible in the structure of substrate-free EF–CaM (Fig. 4).
In addition to the helical domain movement, three segments designated as switch A, B and C undergo large conformational changes in response to CaM binding, leaving the remaining residues relatively unchanged (Figs 1 and 4).
In the EF-alone structure switch B is disordered, but it becomes highly ordered in the EF–CaM complex (Fig. 4).
Although Switch B corresponds to region 578-591, only a smaller part of it is disordered and it corresponds to region 580-590 as also shown in PDB:1K8T

In the EF-alone structure switch B is disordered, but it becomes highly ordered in the EF–CaM complex (Fig. 4). This transition is most probably caused by extensive contacts between switch B and the N-terminal portion of switch C. Notably, Asn 639 forms a hydrogen bond with the main-chain carbonyl of Pro 587. Mutation of Asn 639 to alanine results in a 12-fold reduction in the rate of catalysis (Fig. 4c and Table 1). Thus, we propose that the ordering of switch B occurs as a consequence of the CaM-induced movement of switch C.
On calmodulin binding, an oedema factor helical domain of relative molecular mass 15,000 undergoes a 15 Å translation and a 30° rotation away from the oedema factor catalytic core, which stabilizes a disordered loop and leads to enzyme activation.
Although Switch B corresponds to region 578-591, only a smaller part of it is disordered and it corresponds to region 580-590 as also shown in PDB:1K8T
Switch B (residues 579–591) contains several residues that either bind ATP directly or stabilize the catalytic residues (Fig. 3).
Phe 586 and Leu 348 lie above and below the plane of the ribose, and the side chain of Asn 583 forms a hydrogen bond with O4′ of the ribose ring. The adenosine ring, although solvent accessible, contacts the backbone of Asp 582 and Asn 583, and the N6 nitrogen is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the main-chain carbonyls of Thr 579 and Thr 548.
Four discrete regions of oedema factor form a surface that recognizes an extended conformation of calmodulin, which is very different from the collapsed conformation observed in other structures of calmodulin bound to effector peptides. On calmodulin binding, an oedema factor helical domain of relative molecular mass 15,000 undergoes a 15 Å translation and a 30° rotation away from the oedema factor catalytic core, which stabilizes a disordered loop and leads to enzyme activation.
The NMR experiments were conducted on a 139 amino acid fragment of CheA which contains the 69 residue CheY-binding domain (residues 159−227) as well as two unstructured domain linkers (residues 124−158 and 228−257).

Residues 222−231 at the carboxy terminus are disordered.
Region 222-231 described in the publication corresponds to the 354-363 residues of the Gag-Pol polyprotein.
This region lacks of electron density in the PDB, indicating disorder. The peptide assessed in this publication is derived from the HIV-1 isolate NL4-3, however the IDR is 100% identical to this Uniprot.
The crystal structure indicates that Gag1-278 comprises ordered MA and CAN domains that are connected by a flexible linker (Figure 1a and b). 
The last 25 residues of the Gag1-278 MA domain and the first 10 residues of the CAN domain are disordered and have been omitted from the refined model of Gag1-278. This flexibility for residues 108−143 could easily accommodate the ∼40 Å gap between the MA and CAN domains that has been inferred for immature virions from electron microscopy ( 12).

Residues Gly 2–Ser 6, Gly 123–Val 143 and Pro 279–Leu 283 show relatively low {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE (XNOE) and T2 relaxation values (Fig. 2), as well as few or no medium-range 1H-1H NOEs, indicating that these residues are conformationally labile. 
Because no restraints were used for the mobile residues that connect the folded domains (Gly 123–Val 143) and no NOEs were observed between the domains, the relative orientation of the MA and CAN domains is not defined.

Residues Pro 217–Pro 231, which include the CypA-binding site, form a conformationally flexible loop.
In contrast, the conformation of residues Pro 133–Val 143 of Gag283 is substantially different from that observed in the mature CAN protein. No intermediate or long-range 1H-1H NOEs were observed for these residues in Gag283, and the chemical shift index data indicate that they exist in a random coil conformation (Fig. 2).
The present findings confirm that the β-hairpin is unfolded in the immature protein and support the proposal that β-hairpin formation occurs subsequent to proteolytic cleavage of Gag, triggering capsid assembly4,12.

Consistent with these observations, the CaM·MA-(8–43) structure shows that residues Asp14–Arg20 and Leu31–Glu40 of MA-(8–43) are α-helical, whereas residues Leu21–Gln28 connecting the two MA α-helices, residues Leu8–Leu13 and Leu41–Arg43, lack a regular secondary structure (Fig. 5A).
Region comprised between 14-20 residues is too short to be considered structured. Despite this publication is about Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 group M subtype B (isolate NY5) matrix protein, IDR is 100% identical.
Digestion reactions were conducted on the myr(−)MA-CaM complex as well as unbound myr(−)MA and CaM. The complex was subjected to limited proteolysis by the addition of thermolysin (from B. thermoproteolyticus rokko) at 1:1000 (enzyme:complex) molar ratio (see “Experimental Procedures” for more details). After 2 h, the MA protein was readily cleaved, whereas the CaM protein was intact (Fig. 6). Digestion of the complex has resulted in an ∼5-kDa MA peptide that was resistant to proteolysis. Analysis of the digestion products by mass spectrometry revealed that the abundant MA species that was resistant to proteolysis is a peptide spanning residues 7–43 with monoisotopic mass of 4403.47 Da (Fig. 6) as identified by both exact mass measurements and tandem mass spectrometric sequencing. Another closely related minor species for residues 7–44 was also detected (supplemental Fig. S3). On the other hand, digestion of unbound MA resulted in a cleavage of a flexible helix on the C-terminal domain leaving intact residues 1–114 (Fig. 6).
In addition, it appears that when compared with the unbound MA protein, CaM binding to MA induced significant conformational changes that facilitated cleavage by thermolysin.

The CD spectrum of the free peptide displays a negative band at ∼200 nm, consistent with a random coil, whereas that of the CaM protein shows two minima at 208 and 222 nm, consistent with a helical structure of the protein.
The CD spectrum of the free peptide displays a negative band at ∼200 nm, consistent with a random coil, whereas that of the CaM protein shows two minima at 208 and 222 nm, consistent with a helical structure of the protein. The CD spectrum of the complex is similar to that of the CaM protein, with features distinctive of α-helical type (supplemental Fig. S5). Binding of MA-(8–43) results only in a slight increase of CD minima of CaM, suggesting an increase in the α-helical character.
The two-dimensional HSQC data obtained for a 15N-labeled MA-(8–43) shows a narrow dispersion of the amide proton resonances, indicating a lack of ordered structure (supplemental Fig. S6).
The two-dimensional HSQC data obtained for a 15N-labeled MA-(8–43) shows a narrow dispersion of the amide proton resonances, indicating a lack of ordered structure (supplemental Fig. S6). Upon binding of CaM, almost all 1H,15N signals of MA-(8–43) exhibited substantial chemical shift changes resulting in large chemical shift dispersion, which indicates that the peptide adopts an ordered structure upon binding to CaM.

Proteolysis data clearly indicate that MA residues 7–43 are protected upon binding to CaM.
Upon binding of CaM, almost all 1H,15N signals of MA-(8–43) exhibited substantial chemical shift changes resulting in large chemical shift dispersion, which indicates that the peptide adopts an ordered structure upon binding to CaM.
 Thermodynamic data revealed that MA-(8–43) binds to CaM with 1:1 stoichiometry (Fig. 7). Strikingly, the binding affinity is much tighter (Kd = 25 nm) than that observed for all peptides described above (Table 1). What is even more intriguing is that the binding affinity of MA-(8–43) to CaM is 32-fold tighter than that of MA-(11–46), suggesting that residues Leu-8, Ser-9, and Gly-10 of MA contribute to the stabilization of the complex.
To assess the role of electrostatic and hydrophobic factors, ITC data were obtained for MA-(8–43) as titrated with CaM at high salt concentration (500 mm NaCl). Our data revealed that the binding affinity (Kd = 60 nm) is only reduced by ∼2-fold upon increasing the salt concentration from 50 to 500 mm (Fig. 7), indicating that electrostatic interactions are not important in stabilizing the CaM-MA-(8–43) complex. This result is also consistent with that obtained for CaM binding to the full-length MA protein (46), indicating that interactions between CaM and MA-(8–43) are mainly hydrophobic.
CD spectra of the Rev ARM peptide in physiological buffer exhibited a minimum around 200 nm, typical of an unfolded state (Fig. 1 A).
To obtain residue-specific information regarding the Rev ARM peptide, we recorded 1HN,15N-HSQC spectra (Fig. 2). In aqueous solution, the peptide shows little dispersion of the resonances (Fig. 2 B), indicative of an unfolded peptide and in accordance with the CD data.
Fig. 5 B shows that the [1HN],15N hetNOE values for Rev ARM in aqueous solution at pH 7.4 average 0.47 for residues T34–R50, consistent with a disordered peptide. In contrast, the hetNOEs of the Rev ARM peptide in complex with RRE StemIIB average 0.83 for residues T34–R50, and in 50% TFE average 0.77 for residues T34–R50. These higher hetNOE values indicate higher backbone rigidity and are typical of a well-ordered secondary structure.
RRE StemIIB it's the RNA binding Rev ARM.

We further characterized the differences in IA and IIB binding modes using amide proton chemical shifts from 15N HSQC NMR spectra to monitor changes in the peptide-RNA interfaces. There is little peak dispersion of peptide resonances in the absence of RNA (Figure 5C), indicative of a largely unstructured molecule.
We further characterized the differences in IA and IIB binding modes using amide proton chemical shifts from 15N HSQC NMR spectra to monitor changes in the peptide-RNA interfaces. There is little peak dispersion of peptide resonances in the absence of RNA (Figure 5C), indicative of a largely unstructured molecule. However, we observe substantial amide peak dispersion in the presence of either IIB (red) or IA (blue) RNAs (Figure 5C), including the Hε protons of arginine side chains (Figure 5C inset). The overall upfield shifts observed in both 1H and 15N dimensions is consistent with stabilization of peptide α-helical structure upon binding (Wang and Jardetzky, 2002).
Given, the purine-rich internal loop of IA, we asked if this amino acid also is essential for IA binding. Interestingly, mutation of Asn40 had no effect on IA binding. Conversely, mutation of Arg41, which does not affect IIB binding (Tan et al., 1993), showed a reproducible 2-fold decrease in IA affinity (Figure 5A). R38A and R46A mutants showed similar 2-fold reductions in IA affinity but had no effect on IIB, while R43A, R44A, and W45A mutants bound IA like the wild type peptide. Helical wheel projections clearly show that different surfaces of the helix are used to recognize IIB and IA RNAs (Figure 5B).
As shown in a gel mobility shift assay (Figure 2), the addition of Rev normally leads to formation of multimeric complexes with 35S-labelled RRE.
The experiment demonstrates the specificity of the Rev-importin-β interaction, as importin-β did not bind to the GST-Rev NLS mutant, or to GST protein. This was an unexpected finding, and identifies Rev as the first protein known to contain an NLS specific for the 97 kDa importin-β receptor, and not importin-α.
Rev–GFP showed typical predominantly nuclear localization (>80% of fluorescence) (Fig. 2A). In contrast, RevM5–GFP fluorescence was apparent mainly in the cytoplasm, with less than 22% of total fluorescence in the nucleus (Fig. 2A).
RevM5 has a mutation in this IDR.
Our crystallographic studies have shown that two active center loops (an inner loop formed by residues 401–413 and outer loop formed by residues 541–557) of the E1 component of the Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase complex become organized only on binding a substrate analog that is capable of forming a stable thiamin diphosphate-bound covalent intermediate.
we have demonstrated that disorder to order transformation of active center dynamic loops (particularly the inner loop) modulates steps through LThDP formation. Ordering of loops also facilitates E1ec to E2ec active center communication reconfirming our previous hypothesis, presumably by acting as a recognition site for E2ec lipoyl domain, and acts as a regulatory switch for the next committed step in E1ec catalysis.

Only spanning residues 495-506 are missing from crystal structure 2OGQ, the residues 493, 494 and 507, indicated as boundaries of the disordered loop by the authors are ordered in the structure
After careful comparison of the three models, the main difference arises from the 20-residue loop, which is disordered in the apo and PBD-Cdc25C structures (residues Ala-493–Arg-507 for apo and Glu-488–Arg-507 for the PBD-Cdc25C complex).

In the refined ``native'' structure (i.e. the SeMet variant), the loop comprising residues 58 through 72 (b1-a1-loop) is completely disordered.
The region the authors are reffering to corresponds to the 50-64 residues of the Uniprot.
In the refined ``native'' structure (i.e. the SeMet variant), the loop comprising residues 58 through 72 (b1-a1-loop) is completely disordered." Curator statement "The region the authors are reffering to corresponds to the 50-64 residues of the Uniprot.
Upon binding of L-rhamnitol, however, this segment, which will be named the b1-a1-loop, closes the top of the (b/a)8-barrel, covers the active site and excludes the bound inhibitor from contact with bulk solvent (Figure 8). The electron density maps and re®nement suggest that the b1-a1-loop becomes essentially as well ordered as neighboring parts of the protein.
It was noted above that the binding of the inhibitor L-rhamnitol, and to a lesser degree the binding of the substrate, L-rhamnose, causes the b1-a1-loop to cover the active site like a lid (Figure 8). 
The structures of complexes of rhamnose isomerase with the inhibitor L-rhamnitol and the natural substrate L-rhamnose were determined and suggest that an extended loop, which is disordered in the native enzyme, becomes ordered on substrate binding, and may exclude bulk solvent during catalysis.
Our crystal structure of murine p97 comprises residues 17–700 and consists of: complete models for the N terminal substrate binding domain and the D1 AAA domain, and a poly-alanine partial model for the D2 AAA domain, in which the α-helical and C-terminal regions are highly disordered (see representative densities in Fig. 1).

Domain 1 (residues 24–177, the N-terminal 23 residues of the protein are disordered) forms the core of the structure and has a mixed α/β structure.
The solution structure of the DPBD, the first of a WRN fragment, has been solved by NMR. DPBD consists of a winged helix-like motif and an unstructured C-terminal region of approximately 20 aa.
The ensemble within the box displays all 144 residues and illustrates the disordered N and C termini.
The C-terminal 24 residues are largely unstructured (Fig. 2). The unstructured C terminus contains two cysteine residues, C1070 and C1090, which most likely contribute to the oligomerization of the protein.
The significance of the unstructured C terminus in the DPBD in the DNA and protein binding remains to be determined.
Significantly, there was a large unstructured region between Met128 and Arg163 that contained a high proportion of proline residues (12 out of 35).
The SH2 domain is formed by residues Gly45-Asn185, excluding an unstructured insert of 35 residues (Pro129-Arg163).
Following helix B, there is a 35 residue insert, a PEST motif (Rogers et al., 1986). This displays no evidence of structure, and backbone amide NMR relaxation data suggest a high degree of flexibility (see Figures S1 and S2 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online).
Intracellular levels of SOCS3 are strongly regulated by proteolysis. As PEST motifs are known to be signals for protein degradation in vivo, we measured the half-life of SOCS3 proteins that lacked the PEST motif, as well as constructs lacking both the SOCS box and the N-terminal region.
Pulse-chase experiments show that removing the PEST motif decreases SOCS3 turnover (Figure 5A) in both full-length SOCS3 (Figure 5A, left panel) and SOCS3(22-185) (Figure 5A, right panel). Removing the PEST motif had a greater effect on SOCS3 stability than did removing both the SOCS box and N-terminal domain.
The PEST motif consists of the Pro129-Arg163 residues.
A 42-residue 15N-labelled recombinant SOCS box peptide was produced; the 1H–15N HSQC spectrum of this isolated peptide is characteristic of that of an unstructured protein (Fig. 4a).
Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments of unlabelled SOCS box domain also suggested that the peptide was completely unstructured in solution (data not shown).
The SOCS box is unstructured in isolation but becomes structured upon elonginBC association
These data imply that the C-terminal half of the SOCS box undergoes significant conformational exchange in the absence of bound cullin5 whether as an isolated domain or as part of full-length SOCS3.
Resonances that could be assigned in this region showed α-helical chemical shifts but were significantly broadened and displayed NOEs only to adjacent residues. In contrast, the N-terminal half of the SOCS box, which contains the elonginBC-binding motif (the BC box, residues 1–12) was completely assigned and well structured.

These data imply that the C-terminal half of the SOCS box undergoes significant conformational exchange in the absence of bound cullin5 whether as an isolated domain or as part of full-length SOCS3.
This region, the SOCS3 elonginBC binding motif (termed the BC box), which is completely unstructured as an isolated peptide and only adopts structure upon binding, exists as a nine-residue α-helix with a three-residue N-terminal extension.

Therefore, the minimal high-affinity binding epitope for elonginBC on SOCS3 is VATLQHLCRKTV 197, corresponding to residues 1–12 of the SOCS box domain.
Residues 15–28, which include residues 22–28 of the kinase inhibitory region, are disordered.

Here, we present the crystal structure, at 3.1 å resolution, of a large fragment of colicin N (missing the first 66 residues) that contains the pore-forming and the receptor-binding domains.
The translocation domain, located between residues 17 and 66 [44], has a glycine/proline/serine/asparagine-rich sequence, which is likely to have poorly defined secondary structure. The translocation domain is absent in the 3.1 å resolution structure, but the majority of it is present in the initial crystal form (see the Materials and methods section), which comprises residues 37–387.
There is no evidence of any density for the translocation domain; this is in complete accord with circular dichroism and fluorescence results, which demonstrate that this domain does not adopt any regular secondary structure.
The residue boundaries differ from the ones reported by the authors, because they did not use the UniProt sequence (the latter contains a signal peptide).
By expressing the far-UV CD spectra in units of dE where concentration is in moles of protein/liter rather than the more conventional moles of residues/liter we can generate the expected spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of TolA-(296 – 421) and T-domain (Fig. 1B). This can be compared with the measured far-UV CD spectrum of the 1:1 complex. The spectra are different, indicating that changes in secondary structure occur upon binding. The difference between TolA-(296 – 421) and the complex is also shown (Fig. 1A). This may correspond to the new structure of the T-domain with a reduction in the unstructured component and its replacement by a secondary structure signal (210–225 nm).
The CD data suggest large scale changes in the secondary structure of the T-domain during TolA binding. The measured spectrum of the complex differs significantly from the summed spectra of the two individual components, and subtraction of the TolA-(296 – 421) spectrum from the complex reveals a “T- domain like” signal, which, however, contains less random and more secondary structure.
The 1H– 15N HSQC spectrum of N-labelled intact colicin N confirms that the protein contains a largely unstructured and flexible region (Fig. 1), as indicated by the numerous sharp amide NH resonances with a narrow 1H chemical shift dispersion, between 7.5 and 9 ppm, seen in the spectrum at a high threshold where broad peaks from the folded domains are not visible (Fig. 1). Sequential assignment of these resonances revealed that they belong to the 90 residue T-domain.
resonances for T-domain 2–90 are sharp signals with a relatively narrow 1H chemical shift dispersion as expected for a disordered protein
All of the 85 expected backbone NH resonances of T-domain 2–90 could be assigned unambiguously (Fig. 3) consistent with an intra-molecular interaction of the T-domain of intact colicin N with one of its folded domains.
The isolated colicin N N-terminal domain appears to be unstructured in circular dichroism 
The isolated T-domain is unstructured. The circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the isolated T- domain shows a random coil conformation, although the negative signal between 210 and 240nm may indicate some ordered secondary structure
The isolated colicin N N-terminal domain appears to be unstructured in circular dichroism and fluorescence studies.
Consistent with the random coil CD data, the two tryptophans of the isolated T-domain are exposed to the aqueous phase
The aqueous exposure of the tryptophans is further evidence of the unfolded state of the isolated T-domain
We have measured the binding of colicin N to TolA by isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC)
The isolated N-terminal domain exhibits a higher affinity for TolA (Kd = 1 uM) than does the whole colicin (18 uM)

Isolated T-domain has a higher TolA binding affinity than colicin N
the isolated T-domain shows more than a 10-fold increase in affinity in ITC experiments
The isolated T-domain has a dissociation constant of 1uM for TolA
We have measured the binding of colicin N to TolA by isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC) and tryptophan fluorescence
On complex formation with TolA, the tryptophans of the T-domain become buried with a Stern–Volmer constant of 0.8 M-1.
T-domain does not exist as an extended strand in solution, but rather adopts a compact average conformation without forming long stretches of secondary structure.
The initial 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the T-domain 40–76 peptide in solution showed at least 35 peaks, excluding side chain signals, suggesting that all the backbone NH resonances were detected between 7.7 and 8.7 ppm (1H). NOESY data collected on the peptide showed very few cross-peaks, presumably owing to its flexibility. The 1H-15N HSQC peaks of the T-domain 40–76 are clearly not clustered in the narrow region (~0.45 ppm 1H) to be expected for a random coil, but are more dispersed, covering a range of 1 ppm (1H), which indicates that the peptide has at least some regions of non-random structure. However, if the peptide were rigidly structured the NOESY spectrum would be expected to show considerably more cross-peaks than were observed.
The binding to TolA-II,III was measured by tryptophan fluorescence and SPR (Fig. 2 and Table I). S58C, S61C, N70C, and N71C exhibit binding comparable to the wild-type T-domain.

For labeled sample k-1 was five times higher (0.051 +/- 0.037 s-1) than for the unlabeled one (0.011 +/- 0.012 s-1). This gives Kd values of 0.5 uM for N71C and 0.1 uM for N71C-AEDANS. The k1 values are similar to those obtained by the 90-residue wild-type T-domain (1.6 * 10^5 M-1 s-1) in the same system (13), while the k-1 value for the wild-type was higher (0.37 s-1).
Fluorescence and surface plasmon resonance confirm that the new unfolding transition accompanies dissociation of ColN-(1–90). Hence upon binding the disordered structure of ColN-(1–90) converts to a cooperatively folded domain without altering the TolA-(296–421) structure.
The binding of full-length (ColN-(1–90)) T-domain to these TolA variants was measured using fluorescence spectroscopy and gel filtration chromatography. The T-domain contains two tryptophans that become buried upon TolA binding causing both an increase and a blue shift of their fluorescence emission (32–34). Both TolA variants with natural C termini bound to T-domain with similar affinity.

A decrease in elution volume (increase in size) was observed when T-domain was mixed with TolA-(296 – 421) and TolA-(329 – 421) but not in the presence of TolAT.
As expected the T-domain in solution is predicted to have more random structure (H4/S31/T23/R41), but the strand content is significant.
The disordered nature of this domain is revealed by far-UV CD spectra (Fig. 1 and previous work (19, 33, 34)), and we show here that the T-domain also lacks two further features of folded proteins. The first is cooperative folding/unfolding as revealed by heat denaturation. The far-UV CD spectra recorded at increasing temperatures show a gradual almost linear change with temperature consistent with the isolated unfolding of individual structures rather than the sigmoidal unfolding curves found with proteins folded in cooperative domains (Fig. 4). The fact that the T-domain “unfolds” with temperature is supportive of the possibility that it contains some secondary structure (premolten globule) or polyproline II helix (PII), which can at higher temperatures adopt a different conformation (46).
The gel filtration data here further show that the hydrodynamic radius of free T-domain is only slightly larger than a folded protein of this size.
The near-UV CD spectra of T-domain is virtually featureless and consistent with its mobile and exposed aromatic residues (Fig. 3A)
The difference between the predicted and experimental spectra is shown in Fig. 3C (solid line). This reveals an additional positive signal in the spectrum of the complex in the region 270–290 nm with clearly resolved peaks at 272, 279, and 290 nm. The latter is unique to tryptophan and thus can be directly linked to T-domain folding upon binding.
In fact, the near-UV CD spectrum of the complex provides evidence of an additional tryptophan signal that can only come from ordering of the T-domain.
The peptide was concentrated with a Speed-Vac (Savant, Albertville, MN) and desalted on PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Its binding to
TolA-II,III resembled the binding of the full-length T-domain since a Kd of 1.3 uM was obtained by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurement.

TolA-II,III resembled the binding of the full-length T-domain since a Kd of 1.3 uM was obtained by the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurement. In addition, the tryptophan fluorescence spectrum exhibited the same increase and blue-shift upon TolA-II,III binding.
Adding unlabeled TolA-III to the labeled T-domain peptide immediately caused new peaks to appear with some of the original peaks reducing in intensity. The number and intensity of the new signals continued to increase with further additions of TolA-III and the intensity of the original peaks reducing further.
Thus, the NMR data clearly demonstrate that the colicin N T-domain 40 –76 peptide and TolA-III formed a complex and that the peptide adopts an organized structure in the complex.
Adding unlabeled TolA-III to the labeled T-domain peptide immediately caused new peaks to appear with some of the original peaks reducing in intensity. The number and intensity of the new signals continued to increase with further additions of TolA-III and the intensity of the original peaks reducing further. This trend continued until a 1:2 molar ratio was obtained. Increasing the ratio to 1:4 gave no further changes, indicating that the proteins were already fully bound.
Complex formation was also checked in the temperature range 20–40 °C by SPR (BIACORE) (Fig. 7). TolA-(296–421) was immobilized, and increasing concentra- tions of T-domain were injected over it. The amount of stably bound T-domain at each temperature was determined by allowing the binding to reach equilibrium. The binding decreased with increasing temperature.

The NMR structure of the intact recombinant human prion protein, hPrP(23–230), contains a globular domain that extends approximately from residues 125–228, a flexibly extended N-terminal tail of residues 23–124, and a short flexible chain end of residues 229–230 (Fig. ​(Fig.11a), which is similar to the previously described structure of mPrP(23–231) (14, 15) and the characterization of shPrP(29–231) (16). These global features are qualitatively manifested in the small dispersion of the 1H chemical shifts and negative values of the 15N{1H}-NOEs for the residues 23–124, as described in detail for mPrP(23–231) (14), which contrasts with the fact that the corresponding parameters for the residues 125–228 have typical values for a globular protein of the size of hPrP(23–230).
In the aqueous monomer spectrum, a broad peak is observed for the 3 random coil Thr (35, 97, 109), while the remaining 9 Thr of helices α2 and α3 have α-helical shifts (Fig 1I). Upon LLPS, the α-helical Cα and Cβ bands shift to random coil. Since 8 of the 9 α-helical Thr are located in helices α2 and α3 (Fig. 1J) (Calzolai and Zahn, 2003), this region shifts to random coil during LLPS. Melting of this Thr stretch has previously been associated with pH 4.6, but in LLPS it occurs at pH 7.4. Curator statement: exact entry boundaries are ambiguous from the article data. Therefore, boundaries of the structural transition comprises from the first threonine (Thr 183) of the The-cluster to the last one (Thr 201). 
Upon Aβo binding and hydrogel formation (Fig. 4B, 4D, 4F), both Gly and Ala spectral regions shift from random coil to α-helical secondary chemical shifts. For Ala, the Cα-Cβ peaks (Fig. 4E, 4F) shift entirely from random coil to α-helical, indicating that a domain including AA113–120 forms an α-helix upon Aßo binding. A similar shift is observed for most Gly resonances. This implies that the octapeptide-repeat region adopts a helical conformation upon Aßo binding.
FRAP demonstrated rapid recovery of PrP-Alexa568 fluorescence due to facile translational diffusion of PrPC (Fig. 1E).
Time lapse imaging reveals that as PrPC droplets settle, they spread and relax within seconds, accumulating as flat pools. The PrPC layer grows thicker as PrPC droplets settle (Fig. 1F, Fig. S1E, Movie M1).

The mobility of PrPC and mGluR5 were studied by FRAP of CLIP-Surface 547-PrP and SNAP-Alexa 647-mGluR5. Following Aβo, there is parallel reduction of PrPC and mGluR5 mobility (Fig. 5A). Both PrPC and Aβo are necessary to slow mGluR5 mobility, as Aβo-treated cells expressing SNAP-mGluR5 alone or vehicle-treated cells expressing both SNAP-mGluR5 and CLIP-PrP do not repond (Fig. 5B, Fig. S5A). Moreover, mGluR5 recruitment is specific, since Aβo-treatment of cells co-expressing CLIP-PrP and GPI-anchored SNAP tag has no effect on SNAP-GPI mobility (Fig. 5C, 5D, Fig. S5B).
In parallel, we sought biochemical evidence for mGluR5 recruitment to Aβo/PrP hydrogels by a centrifugation-based condensation assay. To facilitate mGluR5 expression, we utilized a truncated form (mGluR5-∆ICD). We detected the assembly of Aβo/PrP hydrogels as a shift of PrPC and Aβo from supernatants into pellets (Fig. 5E, 5F). A substantial fraction of mGluR5-∆ICD segregates to hydrogel pellets together with PrPC and Aβo. Neither Aβo nor PrPC alone cause a shift for mGluR5. Moreover, the amount of mGluR5 in the hydrogel decreases with Aβo excess. 
NMR fingerprint spectra of 15N-labeled Pex5-(1–110) show very little dispersion, characteristic of an unstructured protein.
Pex5 binds the N-terminal Pex14 domain via a short segment containing the reverse motif FXXXW.
Upon addition of unlabeled Pex14-NTD, the spectrum changes significantly, indicating a strong interaction between Pex5-(1–110) and Pex14-NTD (Fig. 2A). The region including residues Glu-59 to Gln-70 of human Pex5 (59EDELVAEFLQDQ70) forms an α-helix upon interacting with Pex14-NTD
Disordered regions not observed in electron density included Sae1 residues 178–203 and 346, and Sae2 residues 1–3, 219–237, 291–304, and 551–640.
In SAE1, the N-terminal helices H1 and H2 that lie beneath the Cys domain and UBA2 helix 13 in the open conformation move out of the adenylation active site and become disordered in the closed conformation.
The authors referred as closed conformation the structure formed by the  E1~SUMO1-AVSN complex, whereas mention as open conformation the structure that forms the E1/SUMO1-AMSN complex.

Another notable difference was that E1 amino acids 607–640 of UBA2 were observed in contacts with SUMO1 via a C-terminal SIM motif (aa 632–640; ELDDVIALD; Supplemental Fig. 2) although the functional significance of the SIM remains unclear because amino acids 550–640 are dispensible for human E1 activity in vitro and for yeast E1 function in vivo in S. cerevisiae9.

The plot of the PIR pattern, shown in Fig. 2, displays no trace of the bell shape associated with compact, globular particles.
All these observations and simple calculations support the view of PIR as an unfolded molecule with little or no residual structure in solution.
The CD spectrum of Grb14 PIR exhibits characteristics typical of a random coil, like the large negative ellipticity at 200 nm and the low ellipticity at 185 nm.
The secondary structure content of the N-terminal extracellular domain of beta-dystroglycan (a recombinant fragment extending from positions 654 to 750) has been quantitatively determined by means of CD and FTIR spectroscopies. The elements of secondary structure, namely an 8-10 residue long alpha-helix (10%) and two beta-strands (24%) have been assigned to specific amino acid sequences by means of a GOR constrained prediction method. The remaining 66% of the whole sequence is classified as turns or unordered.

All these data provide compelling evidence that  β-DG(654−750) molecules represent an ensemble of different populations of disordered polypeptide chains.
The binding of β-DG(654−750) to the C-terminal region of the α subunit, α-DG(485−620), has been investigated, showing that the region of β-DG(654−750) between residues 691 and 719 is involved in the interaction.
In aqueous solution, the AR polypeptide showed relatively little stable secondary structure. The dominant feature of the CD spectrum was a minimum at around 200 nm, which is characteristic of a non-ordered polypeptide (Fig. 2A). 
In aqueous solution, the AR polypeptide
showed relatively little stable secondary structure. The dominant feature of the CD spectrum was a minimum at around 200
nm, which is characteristic of a non-ordered polypeptide (Fig.
2A). In contrast, in the presence of increasing amounts of the
hydrophobic solvent TFE, the CD spectrum was characterized
by minima at 208 and 222 nm, indicative of a significant
proportion of alfa-helical structure (Fig. 2A). 
The analysis indicates that the helical content increased from 13 to 40% with a reduction in the turn and other
structure contents from 32 to 20% and from 36 to 25%, respectively, as the TFE concentration was increased from 0 to 50%
(Fig. 2B).
The fluorescence spectrum for AR4 is characterized by an emission maximum at 343 nm, due to the tryptophan residues, and a shoulder at 309 nm, resulting from tyrosine emission (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B shows that in the presence of increasing amounts of acrylamide the fluorescence intensity for the tryptophan maximum after excitation at 295 nm was reduced. From the linear plot, a Stern-Volmer constant (Ksv) of 10.8 M1 was calculated, indicating that both tryptophans have a high degree of exposure to solvent and behave in an identical fashion (35).
In the presence of up to 3 M TMAO
there was an increase in the quantum yield, the tryptophan
emission maximum blue shifted to 336 nm, and the shoulder
due to tyrosine fluorescence was lost (Fig. 3A). A similar trend
was observed with 10 and 20% TFE (data not shown). These
results indicate that the two tryptophan residues become less
solvent-exposed, and there is an increase in the energy transfer
from tyrosine to tryptophan residues, consistent with the AR
polypeptide becoming more structured.
Taken together the
spectroscopy analysis indicates that the AR transactivation
domain is structurally flexible and capable of a adopting a more
folded conformation in the presence of the alcohol TFE or the
natural osmolyte TMAO.
In the presence of RAP74-CTD
(amino acids 363–517), the AR polypeptide was markedly less
susceptible to cleavage by trypsin (Fig. 7A) and chymotrypsin
(Fig. 8A).
We interpret these
results as providing evidence for at least in part a conformational change in the AR4 polypeptide upon binding of RAP74-
CTD, which leads to a protease resistant state.

The GST-AR4 fusion protein was extremely sensitive to proteolytic cleavage, and treatment with trypsin, chymotrypsin, or endoproteinase Glu-C resulted in the generation of a series of stable fragments of relative molecular mass 24,000–30,000 Da, representing the
GST moiety (Figs. 7 and 8). In the presence of RAP74-CTD (amino acids 363–517), the AR polypeptide was markedly less susceptible to cleavage by trypsin (Fig. 7A) and chymotrypsin (Fig. 8A).
Using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), we tested whether this interaction can induce structure in the AR AF1. 
When the sum of the second-derivative spectra of AF1 and RAP74-CTD are compared with the spectrum of the AF1/RAP74-CTD mixture (Figure 2B), it is evident that the helical content is higher in the AF1/RAP74-CTD mixture than in the summation of the AF1 and RAP74-CTD spectra, suggesting that these changes are not just additive. Comparison of the second-derivative spectra of AF1 with and without RAP74-CTD present indicated a significant increase in helical content in AF1 when mixed with RAP74-CTD (Figure 3A), suggesting that interaction with RAP74-CTD leads to imposition of helical structure on the AF1 domain.
Our results indicate that the AF1 domain has little helical structure until it encounters RAP74. This interaction leads to formation of more helical conformation in AR AF1.  This appears to come as a result of the loss of β-sheet along with an accumulation of small losses of turns, bends, and coil.
Our findings herein, showing that AR AF1 adopts a more helical conformation when bound to RAP74, clearly indicate that AF1 can acquire helical structure through an induced-fit mechanism, when it encounters a specific binding partner.

To test whether induced folding of AR AF1 similarly enhanced coactivator binding, we carried out a series of “pulldown” experiments with the GST−AF1 fusion protein and the radiolabeled SRC-1 C-terminal domain (amino acids 977−1441, SRC-CTD).
Strikingly, a similar enhancement (40-fold) in the level of SRC-CTD binding was observed after preincubation of the GST−AF1 protein with RAP74-CTD.
Our data clearly show that the presence of TMAO and binding of RAP74 each induce a conformation in the AR AF1 domain, which facilitates AF1's interaction with SRC-1.
However, it should be emphasized that the main conclusion from the protein−protein interaction data is that preincubation with the binding partner TFIIF (RAP74), but not a noninteracting protein, significantly enhanced the interaction of SRC-CTD. We conclude that conditional folding of the AR AF1 domain is a prerequisite for tight binding of SRC-1 to AF1.
As shown in Figure 4, in 3 M TMAO there is a large change in the peak at ∼1656 cm-1, consistent with greatly increased helical content.
TMAO is known to cooperatively fold intrinsically unstructured proteins (9, 31−33) , and cooperative folding of proteins is associated with “native-like” conformations ( 34, 35). This result suggests that the induced AF1 conformation(s) may be physiologically relevant.
Native AR-AF1 was rapidly digested by protease treatment, with full-length protein completely digested by 10 to 15 min with trypsin and by 2 min with chymotrypsin, resulting in a stable fragment representing GST (Figure 1 and data not shown).
Purified AR-AF1 was titrated with increasing amounts of ANS which resulted in a hyperbolic curve, and ANS-binding sites appeared saturated above 40 µM (Figure 4A). Incubation of AR-AF1 with ANS resulted in a significant increase in fluorescence intensity and a blue shift for the maximum emission to 465 nm (Figure 4B).
Taken together, these data indicate that AR-AF1 in a native state binds ANS and exhibits ANS binding characteristics similar to those of a well-characterized molten globule state protein.
Second, the fluorescence properties of complexes between AR-AF1 and the hydrophobic probe ANS suggest a partially folded intermediate resembling a pre-molten globule or molten globule state.
Coomassie-stained gel of the peak fractions are shown: average elution volume (Ve) for AR-AF1 was calculated to be 57.7 ± 0.6 mL with a gel phase distribution coefficient (Kav) of 0.71 (Figure 6A and data not shown). By comparing these values with those of the standard proteins, we calculated the molecular mass and Stokes radius of AR-AF1 to be 64.7 ± 6.4 kDa and 36.4 ± 1.8 Å, respectively (Figure 6B). These values differ greatly from predicted values (Figure 6B) and strongly suggest AR-AF1 is less compact than a native protein similar in size. Uversky and colleagues have recently collated molecular mass and the Stokes radius for a range of proteins and generated “folding-state” curves for globular, unfolded, molten globule, and pre-molten globule proteins (48, 49, 53).
Figure 6C shows that the predicted molecular mass and Stokes radius for AR-AF1 are positioned on the folding curve for a globular structured protein, but the experimental calculated properties for AR-AF1 place the receptor transactivation domain with proteins in a molten globule state.
In agreement with previous reports based on the use of other biophysical methods, (6) the 1H,15N-HSQC spectrum of AF-1* had the features expected in an ID region such as low HN chemical shift dispersion (Figure 2a).
The results that we obtained indicated the presence of two regions of high helical propensity (defined as ΔδCα–ΔδCβ > 1 ppm and SSP ≈ 0.5, corresponding to a helical propensity of 50%) which correspond to residues 185–200, in Tau-1, and 390–410, in Tau-5. Other regions of intermediate helical propensity (defined as ΔδCα–ΔδCβ ≈ 0.5 ppm and SSP ≈ 0.2) could also be identified, such as the region 230–240, in Tau-1, and 355–365 in Tau-5 (Figure 2b, c). In addition to identifying regions of helical secondary structure, the analysis of the chemical shifts also suggests that residues 144–154 and 270–290 of AF-1* adopt an extended conformation (ΔδCα–ΔδCβ ≈ −0.5 ppm and SSP ≈ −0.3) (Figure 2b, c).
The results that we obtained, presented in Figure 2d, indicate that the regions with nascent secondary structure revealed by the analysis of the 13C chemical shifts (Figure 2b) also display relatively high R2 values. These are especially high, reaching values of ca. 15 s–1, for three regions of sequence found in Tau-5 predicted to have low disorder propensity (26) and presenting, in two cases, high helical propensity.
In the present communication we apply a combined approach based on bioinformatics, nuclear magnetic resonance, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and small-angle X-ray scattering, and we show that the CtBP C-terminal region is intrinsically unstructured in the full-length CtBP and in constructs lacking the substrate- and/or the nucleotide-binding domains.
The C-terminal region of CtBP3 displays sequence and structural features typical of intrinsically unstructured proteins, a property that may be functional to the assembly of CtBP in the core nuclear complex and/or for the recognition of diverse molecular partners.
These signals appear to be poorly resolved, mainly due to the reduced spread of amide resonances, falling all in the 7.6–8.7 ppm chemical shift range. This observation usually indicates the absence of structural organization of the backbone (Wüthrich 1986).

The difference spectrum shows a slightly positive trend in the 208–240 nm region, indicating no significant increase of α or β secondary structure in the full-length protein relative to t-CtBP3, and a clear minimum around 200 nm, in the region associated to random coil/unfolded conformation (Hollósi et al. 1993).

The excluded volume (126 ± 10 × 103 Å3) is larger than the value expected for a dimeric construct, which may point to unusual flexibility and high degree of hydration of the overall molecular structure. Remarkably, the values of Rg (56.3 ± 0.7 Å) and Dmax (200 ± 10 Å) exceed those of tetrameric full-length CtBP3, indicating an extremely anisotropic shape for the C-term(2) construct. One can thus conclude that the latter construct must be at least partly unfolded.
CD analysis of CD3εcyt, CD3δcyt, CD3γcyt, FcεRIγcyt, Igαcyt, and Igβcyt showed that these proteins are unstructured, random-coiled proteins. In each case, no detectable secondary or tertiary structure was observed with increasing protein concentration (data not shown).

The spectrum of hp8 at pH 6.0 and 25 °C displays an intense minimum at 205 nm (Fig.3 A) and a shoulder expanding from 220 to 230 nm. Such spectrum resembles, except for the shoulder, that of a random coil structure (17, 18).
The percentage of calculated structure is 2%. Thus, hp8 from the far-UV spectra is mainly random coil.
Fig. 10 B shows that DNA binding activity was increased when hp8 recombinant protein was previously phosphorylated by PKA catalytic subunit. A rough estimate of 7-fold increase in affinity can be calculated from the increase in intensity of the complex at similar concentrations of hp8 and PKAhp8 proteins (around 2-fold) and the degree of phosphorylation of PKAhp8, which is around 30% (see before).
The infrared spectrum of nonphosphorylated hp8 (Fig. 4 A) showed an amide I band with a maximum centered near 1644 cm−1, which is characteristic of nonordered conformations.
When using unlabeled ATP, protein phosphorylation was checked by observing the 950–1300 cm−1 band of the FTIR spectra (25).
The near-UV signal of hp8 was null at pH 6.0 and did not change with either the pH or temperature, suggesting the absence of a well fixed structure.
The lack of a well fixed tertiary structure was also confirmed by fluorescence studies. The fluorescence spectrum of hp8 shows exposed tyrosine residues, with a maximum at 305 nm (data not shown).
The lack of a well fixed tertiary structure was also confirmed by fluorescence studies. The fluorescence spectrum of hp8 shows exposed tyrosine residues, with a maximum at 305 nm (data not shown).
The one-dimensional NMR spectra of human hp8 at 5 °C showed small chemical shift dispersion: the amide (Fig. 5 A,left) and the methyl (Fig. 5 A, right) protons were clustered in those regions expected for random coil proteins (24).
Furthermore, the two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments showed lack of long-range contacts (data not shown), suggesting the absence of a well fixed tertiary structure.
The spectrum obtained after incubation of PKAhp8 and DNA together was different from that obtained by adding the spectra of both molecules separately.
 At 222 nm, the added spectrum showed a more negative ellipticity than that of the complex; conversely, in the region ranging from 225 to 240 nm, the spectrum of the complex showed a lower intensity than that of the added spectrum. These changes suggest that PKAhp8 binds DNA.
The fact that hp8 has a high percentage of serines and threonines prompted us to assay the capacity of being phosphorylated by some of the protein kinases predicted to have putative target sites in hp8. Fig. 6 shows that protein kinase A (PKA) and casein kinase 2 phosphorylated hp8, but that Cdc2k did not.
Even at highly optimized phosphorylation conditions, only 30% of hp8 could be phosphorylated, assuming that one phosphate was incorporated per molecule; phosphorylation produced the typical shift in electrophoretic mobility of phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 7).
The crystal structure of mouse Bcl-x(L) bound to a long helical fragment of Bim indicates that the structure of Bim is very different from proteins with a Bcl-2-like fold and may leave the BH3 region of Bim constitutively exposed. 
The Bcl-xL portion of the structure was readily identified using molecular replacement with free mouse Bcl-xL as the model. Additional electron density was seen clearly in the structure occupying in part a groove of Bcl-xL that had previously been shown to bind BH3 peptides from Bak and Bad (Petros et al. 2000, Sattler et al. 1997). Eventually, this density was attributed to a large helical fragment of Bim containing its BH3 region.

In addition, our CD and NMR studies demonstrate that the central region of APC is unstructured in the absence of beta-catenin and Axin, and suggest that beta-catenin may interact with each of the APC 15aa and 20aa repeats independently.
To determine if the central region of APC has a defined secondary structure, the CD spectra of various purified APC fragments, including APC-R2-R3 and APC-R2-R4, were measured. The CD spectra measured for APC-R2-R4 at 4 °C and 25 °C are essentially identical and feature a single minimum in molar residue ellipticity at ∼200 nm (Figure 3(b)). These spectra, as well as the CD spectra for other APC fragments (data not shown), indicate that all these APC fragments are mostly unstructured.
In addition, our CD and NMR studies demonstrate that the central region of APC is unstructured in the absence of beta-catenin and Axin, and suggest that beta-catenin may interact with each of the APC 15aa and 20aa repeats independently.
To exclude the possibility that the APC fragment has a defined structure without regular secondary structure, we measured both 1D and 2D NMR spectra of APC-R2-R4, the longest APC fragment that we were able to obtain in large quantity and that has good solubility. 1D NMR shows no obvious chemical shift signal from 5.5 ppm to 8.5 ppm. The poor dispersion of the resonances indicates that the fragment does not have a folded structure (Figure 3(c)). This lack of folded conformation is also demonstrated in the 2D Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) spectra; there is no inter-residue NOE observed in the 2D-NOESY spectrum, which is characteristic of an unfolded structure (data not shown).
The effect of phosphorylation at these sites on binding to the C-terminal domain of EB1 (EB1c) was assessed in vitro by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) with a polypeptide corresponding to the sequence of APC39 (APCp1; Bu and Su, 2003, Honnappa et al., 2005). ITC revealed that two APCp1 peptides bind to one EB1c dimer, with an equilibrium dissociation constant, Kd, of 5.8 ± 0.1 μM (Figure S5), consistent with previous findings (Honnappa et al., 2005). Peptides phosphorylated at Ser2789 (Honnappa et al., 2005) or Ser2793 (Figure S5) showed ∼4- and ∼6-fold reduced affinity for EB1c when compared to the wild-type peptide.
In order to determine whether the structural features observed in the EB1cΔC8-MACFp1 complex apply more generally to EB1-mediated +TIP interactions, we performed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments on the EB1c-APCp1 complex. 15N{1H}-NOEs demonstrate that whereas APCp1 is unstructured in solution (not shown), the segment 2784–2813 is ordered in the complex with EB1c (Figure 6A). Chemical shift changes and intermolecular 1H-1H NOEs identify residues 2803–2809 encompassing the SxIP motif as a major interaction site, with secondary interactions at residues 2789–2799 (Figure 6A; Figure S7). The remainder of the APCp1 polypeptide is disordered even in the bound state.

APCp1 corresponds to region Val2781-Lys2819 of human APC.

Despite the sequence homology, each of the seven 20aa repeats binds to β-catenin with dramatically different affinities. When unphosphorylated, APC-R3 can bind β-catenin with a Kd of ∼0.2 μM. The binding of β-catenin with every other unphosphorylated 20aa repeat is at least 60 times weaker than APC-R3, and unlikely to interact with β-catenin at physiological conditions (see Discussion).
However, APC-R3 is obviously the repeat having the highest affinity with β-catenin in both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states.
The APC-rBC fragment interacts with two β-catenin molecules, indicating each 15aa repeat binds to one β-catenin molecule. In addition, APC-R2-R4 also interacts with two molecules of β-catenin, indicating that both APC-R3 and APC-R4, but not APC-R2, interact with one molecule of β-catenin simutaneously (Table 1). Thus our ITC study confirms the binding stoichiometry of one β-catenin binding repeat of APC to one β-catenin molecule.
This region corresponds to APC repeat 3 (APC-R3, residues 1459–1532).

This region corresponds to APC repeat 4 (APC-R4, residues 1614–1679).
The two intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) AxinCR and β-caseine, however, were entirely digested at low TL concentration (0.001 g/L). Likewise, the band of APC-MCR disappeared at this TL concentration. We conclude that protease susceptibility of APC-MCR is similar to that of the IDPs Axin-CR and β-caseine.
In non-denaturing buffer and absence of TFE, we observed a minimum near 200 nm and absence of a negative peak at 220 nm indicating low α-helical structure content (Figure 3) [41].
We observed a linear decrease of fluorescence emission with increasing temperature, as it is typical for protein in the absence of global conformational changes (Figure 4A,B,C) [42]. We neither detected any thermally induced transition nor temperature-dependent changes in the spectral shape (Figure 4A, B). We conclude that temperature increase does not induce a structural transition that changes the environment of the intrinsic fluorescence probes in APC-MCR.
The elution time of APC-MCR corresponded to an apparent molecular weight of 200 kDa, 5-fold larger than expected based on its molecular weight of 40 kDa (Figure 5A,B). We conclude that APC-MCR is either predominantly extended or oligomeric.
The protein eluted as a single monomeric peak with a molecular mass of 44.4 ± 4.0 kDa. We conclude that APC-MCR is an extended intrinsically disordered region.
In the presence of ATP and CK1ε, we incubated APC-MCR for up to 16 h and subsequently probed for an eventual change in migration pattern on SDS-PAGE. Additional negative charges locally prevent binding of SDS and, therefore, reduce mobility of the phosphorylated protein in the gel [21,44-47].
Our results demonstrate that APC-MCR can be phosphorylated by CK1ε.
Unexpectedly, we were unable to detect binding of purified β-catenin arm repeat domain to GST-R7 immobilized on glutathione agarose beads, whereas robust binding was seen to GST-R3 (data not shown). 
Both this triple Ser→Asp mutant, designated R3-tripleD, and the wild-type construct were used for cocrystallization trials with β-ARM.
Crystals were obtained only with the R3-tripleD (Table 1). Only 14 of the 47 residues of the APC construct are visible in the final electron density map. The final model consists of β-catenin residues 146-549 and 559-664, ICAT 8-53, and APC 1485-1498.
R3-tripleD corresponds to the APC peptide with the mutations S1501D, S1505D, and S1507D.
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements demonstrated that homogeneously phosphorylated R3 binds to full-length β-catenin with a dissociation constant KD of 10 ± 1.3 nM, as compared to the 3.1 ± 0.3 μM KD of the untreated material (Figures 3A and 3B
Phosphorylated R3 (pR3) was cocrystallized with the arm repeats of β-catenin at pH 6.5, and the structure solved at 2.1 Å. The final model contains β-catenin residues 150-550 and 559-664, and APC 1485-1499 and 1504-1528.
The structure of the pR3/β-catenin complex reveals that residues 1485 to 1499 bind to the arm repeat 5-9 groove identically to that observed in the unphosphorylated complex (Figure 3C).
Phosphorylated R3 (pR3) was cocrystallized with the arm repeats of β-catenin at pH 6.5, and the structure solved at 2.1 Å. The final model contains β-catenin residues 150-550 and 559-664, and APC 1485-1499 and 1504-1528.
Phosphorylation results in the structuring of residues 1504-1528, which interact with β-catenin arm repeats 1-5 (Figures 3D and 3E).
Of the six phosphoserines present in the construct, those at positions 1504, 1505, 1507, and 1510, part of the consensus 1501SxxSSLSSLS APC 20-mer motif, are visible, and three of the four form direct contacts with β-catenin.
APC is phosphorylated by GSK-3β and CK1ϵ (Rubinfeld et al. 1996, Rubinfeld et al. 2001). Mass spectrometry analysis of recombinant R3 treated with these two enzymes in vitro demonstrated that six serines are phosphorylated (data not shown).
Ser1505 is “primed” for CK1 phosphorylation by the presence of Asp1512 and Glu1513. Phosphorylated Ser1505 then serves as a priming site for GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation of Ser1501. With Ser1501 phosphorylated, successive primed phosphorylations by CK1 can occur at Ser1504, Ser1507, and Ser1510. Phosphorylated Ser1507 can also prime a final phosphorylation of Ser1503 by GSK-3β. This scheme accounts for the presence of the six phosphates found in the mass spectroscopic analysis of in vitro-phosphorylated R3.
The CD spectrum of ASR1, without any additive, displayed a minimum dichroic peak cen- tered at 200 nm, typical of disordered conformations, and a low signal above 205 nm, charac- teristic of a more ordered structure (Fig 1A). These observations are in accordance with in silico predictions and experimental observations describing ASR1 as a disordered protein [8].
We report that ASR1 adopts different conformations such as α-helix or polyproline type II in response to environ- mental changes. Low temperatures and low pH promote the polyproline type II conformation (PII). While NaCl increases PII content and slightly destabilizes α-helix conformation, PEG and glycerol have an important stabilizing effect of α-helix conformation.
The binding of Zn2 +in the low micromolar range promotes α-helix folding, while extra Zn2+ results in homo- dimerization. The ASR1-DNA binding is sequence specific and dependent on Zn2+.
Follow-
ing the CD signal change at 222 nm in the Zn2+ titration experiment and considering a 1:1
stoichiometry (see Materials and Methods), we estimated an equilibrium dissociation constant
between ASR1 and Zn2+, KZn2þ , of (9 ± 2) μM.
Incubation of ASR1 with a variety of proteases resulted in the generation of a large number of low molecular weight proteolytic products (Fig. 4A). Binding of zinc to ASR1 induces conformational changes resulting in a decreased sensitivity to proteases.
South-western DNA- binding assays indicate that the carboxy-terminal domain of ASR1 containing residues 61–115 has a zinc-dependent DNA-binding activity, whereas the amino-terminal sequence (residues 1–60) does not (Fig. 1). Using mild acid hydrolysis, and a series of ASR1 carboxy-terminal truncations we show that the zinc-dependent DNA-binding could be mapped to the central/carboxy-terminal domain.
Figure 2. Circular dichroism spectra of MeCP2 domains reveal marked differences in secondary structure content. CD spectra are representative of two to four separate acquisitions. (a) Compared to the 195 nm peak indicative of β-sheet structure within the MBD (◼), all the other domains show a negative band in the 195−198 nm region indicative of disorder. NTD (●), TRD (○), and CTD-α (⊙) have lower structure content than ID (☆) and CTD-β (half-filled circles) (see Table 1 for quantitation)
To construct the NTD (residues 1−90), an amplicon extending 100 bp 5′ of the NdeI site into the pTYB1 vector sequence and carrying a 3′ EcoRI linker (GACCGTGAATTC) was generated by PCR from full-length pTYB1-MeCP2 cDNA carrying MeCP2 cDNA between its NdeI and EcoRI sites, using the following primer pairs: NTD Forward (5′ CCGGTTTAAACCGGGGATCTCGATCC 3′) and NTD Reverse (5′ GTTAGAGAATTCGTCACGGATGATGGAGCGCCGCTG 3′).

From Table 1 the transcriptional repression domain (TRD) spans 207-310
The ID and TRD, when mixed with an equimolar amount of the 45 bp DNA substrate, resulted in striking changes in far-UV CD profiles, independent of the DNA methylation state (Figure 2b,c).

We also investigated interdomain associations intrans using CD, which can detect changes in secondary structure of one or both components in a mixture of the two (63).
With the NTD+MBD, MBD+ID, and MBD+TRD mixtures, we observed a clear difference between the summed individual CD spectra and the spectrum of an equimolar mixture (Figure 7b,c), indicating that an interaction between domains led to change(s) in secondary structure.
ID domain includes 165-210 residues
To construct the MBD (residues 75−164), ID (residues 165−210), TRD (residues 207−310), CTD-α (residues 261−330), and CTD-β (residues 335−486), we engineered amplicons with 5′ NdeI and 3′ EcoRI linkers

Of the six domains, the MBD was the only one showing a characteristic positive band in its CD spectrum at ∼197 nm, indicative of significant ordered secondary structure (Figure 2a). The others had a negative band in this region, indicating extensive disorder, with the NTD and TRD being the most strongly disordered
(b) Addition of DNA (methylated as well as unmethylated) to the ID induces changes typical of the formation of β-structure, namely a marked increase in positive ellipticity at 195 nm and negative ellipticity in the 220−225 nm range.
(c) Addition of DNA (methylated as well as unmethylated) to the TRD results in an increase in the level of order irrespective of the methylation status of the DNA.
The trypsin-resistant bands were excised from the gel and subjected to Edman sequencing. N-terminal sequences were obtained for bands 1-4 and band 6.
Even without positive identification of the C-terminal residues, it is apparent that the protease-resistant MeCP2 regions overlapped with the MBD, TRD, and C-terminal residues 355-486. Correspondingly, residues in the region between the MBD and TRD, as well as sites near residues 310 and 355, were relative hot spots for trypsin digestion.

The trypsin-resistant bands were excised from the gel and subjected to Edman sequencing. N-terminal sequences were obtained for bands 1-4 and band 6. The C-terminal ends of these bands could only be estimated from sizes returned by SDS-PAGE as we were unable to obtain masses from mass spectroscopy. These estimates took into account the anomalously high masses returned by SDS-PAGE.

We conducted droplet formation assays using physiologically relevant concentrations of recombinant MeCP2–GFP domain deletion mutant proteins in the presence of DNA. Although mutant proteins that lack the N-terminal IDR (ΔIDR-1) formed droplets, those that lack the C-terminal IDR (ΔIDR-2) did not (Fig. 2b–d). Furthermore, IDR-1 alone did not form droplets, whereas IDR-2 alone did—albeit with diminished size and number relative to both full-length and mutant ΔIDR-1 proteins (Fig. 2b–d).
MeCP2 full length (WT): residues 1-486; MeCP2 ΔIDR-1: residues 78-486; MeCP2 ΔIDR-2 (R168X): residues 1-167; MeCP2 IDR-1: residues 1-77; MeCP2 IDR-2: residues 168-486; MeCP2 ΔBasic: residues 1-486, removing IDR-2 basic patches (residues 170-181, 184-194, 246-258, 263-274, 282-289, 301-310, and 340-348); MeCP2 ΔAromatic: residues 1-486, removing IDR-2 aromatic residues (F226 and Y450); MeCP2 ΔHistidine: residues 1-486, removing IDR-2 histidine-rich domain (residues 366-372); MeCP2 ΔProline: residues 1-486, removing IDR-2 proline-rich domain (residues 376-405); MeCP2 R133C: residues 1-486, R133C; MeCP2 T158M: residues 1-486, T158M; MeCP2 P225R: residues 1-486, P225R MeCP2 R255X: residues 1-254; MeCP2 R270X: residues 1-269; MeCP2 R294X: residues 1-293; MeCP2 R306C: residues 1-486, R306C; MeCP2 P322L: residues 1-486, P322L; MeCP2 P389X: residues 1-288; MeCP2 Mini: as in the ΔNIC mutant from ref. 22.
TBL1 WD40 domain was efficiently pulled down by wild-type NID but not by RTT mutant peptides or a peptide containing phosphoThr308, a modification known to interfere with NID binding (24) (Fig. 2C). 
The R306C mutation was previously shown to disrupt an interaction between the MeCP2 NCoR-interaction domain (NID) and TBLR1—a subunit of the NCoR co-repressor complex13,21. We therefore examined the ability of R306C mutant condensates to incorporate the C-terminal domain of TBLR1 (TBLR1-CTD), which directly interacts with the NID21. Wild-type MeCP2 droplets readily enriched TBLR1-CTD–mCherry, whereas R306C mutant droplets showed less enrichment (Extended Data Fig. 7), which suggests that MeCP2 condensates can contribute to NID-mediated recruitment of NCoR, a key MeCP2 function previously shown to be disrupted in Rett syndrome13,21. These results suggest that missense mutations in IDR-2 that occur in patients with Rett syndrome contribute to condensate disruption.
Here, we show that the “NCoR/SMRT interaction domain” (NID) of MeCP2 directly contacts transducin beta-like 1 (TBL1) and TBL1 related (TBLR1), two paralogs that are core components of NCoR/SMRT. We determine the cocrystal structure of the MeCP2 NID in complex with the WD40 domain of TBLR1 and confirm by in vitro and ex vivo assays that mutation of interacting residues of TBLR1 and TBL1 disrupts binding to MeCP2.
Fluorescence anisotropy binding with a minimal 11-mer peptide of MeCP2 (residues 298–309). Anisotropy is measured in arbitrary units (A.U.).
Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we measured binding constants (KDs) for alternative NID peptides (NIDs, residues 285–309; or NID, residues 285–313) with the mouse TBLR1-CTD (residues 134–514) (Fig. 2D and Fig. S2B). Wild-type TBLR1-CTD bound MeCP2 NID and MeCP2 NIDS with apparent KDs of 9.5 ± 0.5 μM and 12.9 ± 0.8 μM, respectively.
Among the individual domains, the NTD and CTD-β stand out as inducing only very minor mobility shifts in DNA, whereas the ID, TRD, and CTD-α fragments all induce marked shifts (Figure 3a).

The far-UV CD spectra of reduced hCox17 displays much
lower ellipticity and a minimum at 205 nm consistent with a mostly disordered structure. This lack of structural transition is in agreement with the NMR and FTIR data, supporting hCox17 being mostly disordered in the reduced state.

Free SRP19 is a natively unstructured protein.
Thus, RNA binding and subsequent conformational changes in SRP19 were detected both as the initial change in the resonance energy transfer efficiency to the RNA-tethered Alexa 555 acceptor fluorophore and also as the local change in donor fluorophore environment (Figure 3A).
Because of the extremely high resolution of the three structures (RMSD on atomic positions between 0.03 and 0.07 Å), any deviation among atomic coordinates of different molecules >0.5 Å (a conservative estimate) is meaningful and can be analyzed in terms of molecular flexibility. Other differences are observed between NNGH and the other two structures in loop regions 110–116 (L1+β1), 146–157 (L3+β2+L4), 176–180 (C-terminal part of loop L5), 206–209 (part of loop L7), and 230–236 (central part of loop L8) (Fig. 1 A).
The IDR characterized in the publication spanning residues 146-157 corresponds to region 249-260 of the amino acid sequence.
A comparison of ​Figs.22 and ​and 3A shows that there is a remarkable correspondence between protein loop regions that show conformational heterogeneity among different structures in the solid state and loop regions that are mobile in solution.
The IDR characterized in the publication residues 146-157 corresponds to region 249-260 of the amino acid sequence
The PDB shows missing electron densties in this region.
The PDB shows missing electron densties in this region.
Thus, we employed CD spectroscopy to estimate the secondary structure
content of the AT3182–291 variant (Fig. 2A). Spectra deconvolution
highlighted a highly disordered structure (63.7% random) with 22.4%
of α-helices
Two peaks for AT3182–291 were identified with Rg values of 1.95 ± 0.074 nm (Stoke radius 2.44 ± 0.095 nm) and 2.26 ± 0.003 nm (Stokes radius 2.84 ± 0.004 nm), respectively.
the NMR spectrum of UIM_123 is suggestive of α-helical content with a large amount of disordered structure from the regions adjoining the UIM regions. This is in agreement with chemical shift index analysis of the NMR assignment data that showed α-helical stretches for UIM1 and -2 but was inconclusive for UIM3.
Overall, the C-terminal
tail is mostly unstructured but with regions of strong
helical propensity throughout, with maximal values in the
three UIMs (residues 224–240, 244-263, and 331–348), in
agreement with reports on peptides spanning the isolated
UIMs (17). Interestingly, also the residues in the polyQ tract
that could be assigned (298–305) exhibit some helical propensity.
It has also been suggested that there is a second CaM-binding site within the disordered N-terminal extension of RalA (20). To unambiguously define the CaM-binding site on RalA, we carried out NMR-based chemical shift perturbation (CSP) experiments (Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Fig. S1A) in the presence of Ca2+, utilizing 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) experiments recorded on 15N-labeled RalA· GMPPNP missing the last three residues (CΔ3, reference SI Appendix, Table S1).
Uniformly 13C,15N-labeled, HVR peptide was expressed in Escherichia coli and lipidated with MFn. NMR titrations of unlabeled CaM into the labeled peptide showed that residues within the core 10-residue motif were most affected (SI Appendix, Fig. S6).
This structure shows that the RalA-HVR forms only a single helical turn, remaining mainly disordered even when in complex with CaM.
The partially disordered HVR peptide in this complex, combined with flexibility in the orientations of the N- and C-lobes, is an unusual mode of CaM interaction, and there are only two other CaM-complex structures with this conformational flexibility
It has also been suggested that there is a second CaM-binding site within the disordered N-terminal extension of RalA (20). To unambiguously define the CaM-binding site on RalA, we carried out NMR-based chemical shift perturbation (CSP) experiments (Fig. 1A and SI Appendix, Fig. S1A) in the presence of Ca2+, utilizing 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) experiments recorded on 15N-labeled RalA· GMPPNP missing the last three residues (CΔ3, reference SI Appendix, Table S1).
The C-terminal Cys203 shifted significantly (CSP 0.19 ppm), but its position could also be tracked during the titrations (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). In contrast, resonances corresponding to residues 194 to 202 of the HVR (SLAKRIRER) disappeared during the titration and gradually reappeared at different posi- tions as the titration progressed. This is known as slow exchange and indicates that the chemical shift differences between the free and CaM-bound states for these resonances are larger than the rate of exchange between these states. Such behavior demonstrates that these residues are involved in binding CaM, and the slow exchange rate between free and bound states strongly suggests that it is a high affinity interaction.
Overall, this analysis indicates that there is only one CaM-binding site in RalA, the core motif of which corresponds to 10 residues at the C terminus of the HVR.
Uniformly 13C,15N-labeled, HVR peptide was expressed in Escherichia coli and lipidated with MFn. NMR titrations of unlabeled CaM into the labeled peptide showed that residues within the core 10-residue motif were most affected (SI Appendix, Fig. S6).
The role of the C terminus of RalA in CaM binding was confirmed using scintillation proximity assays (SPA), where [3H] GTP·RalA was titrated into His-tagged CaM immobilized on an SPA bead (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B).
We synthesized two maleimide-functionalized prenyl anchor mimics (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A), MFn (maleimido-farnesyl), which includes a 15-carbon far- nesyl group, and MGG (maleimido-geranylgeranyl), which includes a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl. RalA CΔ3 prenylated with MGG was insoluble in the absence of detergents but could be stabilized by binding to nanodisc membrane mimics. Titration of CaM into nanodisc-bound RalA CΔ3 MGG resulted in a return of heat changes and an apparent binding affinity of 3.8 μM (Fig. 1B).
CaM was immobilized on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip via amine coupling and multicycle experiments recorded by flowing either RalA CΔ3 or RalA CΔ3-MFn over the immobilized protein (Fig. 1C). Dissociation constants for unmodified and prenylated RalA calculated by 1:1 equilibrium analysis (Fig. 1D) were 214 ± 27 nM and 19 ± 3 nM, respectively.
The final model (Figure 3a) includes residues 1−62 and 84−193 of the 193-residue molecule. The absence of electron density for residues 63−83 indicates that these residues form a highly flexible loop that is disordered in the crystal.
It is a well-known fact that binding Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 dye depends on a positively charged residue with adjoining hydrophobic residues.(20) This was probably the reason why Stm, a protein of extremely low hydrophobicity, exhibited lowered Commassie-binding.
The far-UV CD spectrum of StmΔSP is typical for a disordered protein, as can be seen from its large negative ellipticity at 198 nm (Figure 5B).
According to published data, IDPs exhibit a substantially increased hydrodynamic volume relative to globular proteins, leading to a significant increase in their apparent molecular mass.
The emission spectrum has a maximum fluorescence (λmax) of 350 nm, suggesting the occurrence of the W residue in a polar environment. This suggests that it is unlikely that Stm possesses an extensive hydrophobic core, otherwise, the W residue would probably be engaged in its formation.
We observed different levels of Stm phosphorylation depending on the ATP concentration in the solution. The largest shift in Stm mobility was observed when ATP concentrations in the reaction mixture were 0.5 and 5 mM.
We determined that Stm is a calcium binding protein by using a quantitative calcium affinity assay(32) based on the competition between Stm and the fluorescent probe sensitive to calcium ions (Rhod-5N) (Figure 2).
Calcium binding by Stm and StmP was observed as a Rhod-5N fluorescence signal in samples containing Stm and StmP lower than that in the control samples (Figure 2). Fluorescence intensities were used to calculate the affinity of Stm and StmP for Ca2+. The results are summarized in Table 2.
The results of the calcium binding assay showed that Stm bound 28 calcium ions per molecule with an apparent KD of 210 μM.

Calcium ions caused a decrease in the hydrodynamic radius of both StmP and Stm (Figure 3).
In contrast to gel filtration, sedimentation velocity reveals that structures of Stm and StmP are different, as suggested by the difference in the frictional ratio. 
These results confirm that the decrease in the hydrodynamic radius of Stm and StmP in the presence of calcium is caused by compaction of the molecule rather than by dissociation of the subunits.
The CD spectra of Stm and StmP exhibited shapes typical for IDPs. There was a large minimum near 200 nm, which is characteristic for unfolded proteins.
A trypsin digestion test indicates that C82 is significantly sensitive to degradation (Fig. 2C)
The C82 CD spectrum shows a minimum near 200 nm indicating that this protein is a random coil that lacks apparent secondary structure (Fig. 3A).
Although there is a poor 1HN chemical shift distribution in the HSQC of C82 (0.95 ppm), which is typical of proteins that possess little tertiary structure and are disordered, we observed 63 of the 69 expected peaks. Moreover, the NOESY spectra of C82 contain few NOE correlations which is indicative of the absence of secondary structure.
As shown in Figure 4D, CSI Cα of C82 is oscillating around zero, suggesting that C82 exists in an unstructured conformation.
The NOEs, with an average of 0.51, are significantly higher than those observed for C82 in water (Duvignaud et al. 2009) (Fig. 4) and indicate that C82 gains significant order in TFE, although probably not as ordered as a typical globular protein (Fig. 4).
In aqueous solution this region is disordered, as shown by NOEs typical of proteins without any stable secondary structure (Fig. 4).
Authors show the region is intrinsically unstructured by its large negative ellipticity at 200 nm in a circular dichroism study (Fig. 1E).
To confirm our final product, we performed an SDS–PAGE electrophoresis (Fig. 2A) and an in vitro assembly assay showing that the C82 was able to assemble into NLPs in presence of tRNA as seen by electron microscopy (Fig. 2B).
However, C82 is able to organize itself in vitro into NLPs in the presence of structured RNA.

However, C82 is able to organize itself in vitro into NLPs in the presence of structured RNA.
It should be noted that C82 migrates at an abnormal molecular weight of ∼15 kDa instead of the expected ∼10 kDa.
We showed that the N-terminal 75 aa (C 1–75) were sufficient to trigger the formation of NLPs in vitro, while the construct C 1–71 failed. The C 1–75 protein contains only four additional amino acids (PEGR), which delimit the border of the second basic cluster of the C protein, which can play an important role in virus assembly. More than 70 % of the structures observed with the C 1–75 protein were, however, aggregates with a diameter exceeding the expected range for the HCV nucleocapsid. The addition of a further four amino acids in the construct C 1–79 stabilized the particles and gave rise to uniform and structured particles resembling HCV nucleocapsids. Also, the NLPs produced from C 1–82 formed one band with a density of 1·32 g ml−1 in a CsCl gradient, suggesting that all the NLPs were uniform in diameter, appearance and density (Fig. 5F5). Based on these results, we suggest that the minimal assembly domain of the HCV C protein resides in the first 79 aa of the protein. 
Our  NMR  data demonstrated that the 1D 1H spectrum of NS5A-D2 lacks  NMR  signals  in  the  region  of  the  methyl  protons  and the 2D 1H -15N HSQC spectrum show a narrow dispersion  in  the  backbone  amide  proton  resonance  signals  which  only  covers  the  range  of  6.7−8.5  ppm.  Taken  together, our data suggest that the NS5A-D2 is natively dis-ordered or dynamic and is not well structured.
The NMR result showed that some perturbations  in  the  chemical  shifts  were  detected  in  the  15N-HSQC  spectrum  of  15N  labeled  NS5A-D2  protein  upon  the addition of NS5B MK-17 peptide (Figs. 7A and 7B), indicating  that  the  purified  NS5A-D2  shows  binding  to  the peptide. 
NS5A-D2 comprises the region 2212-2307 of the Hepatitis C virus genotype 1a (isolate H) genome polyprotein. The MK-17 peptide consist on the 139−155 residues of NS5B, which corresponds to 2559-2575 region of the Hepatitis C virus genotype 1a (isolate H) genome polyprotein.
Both  NS5AΔN  and  NS5A-D2  were pulled down with GST-NS5Bt (Fig. 3C, lane 2 and lane  5)  but  not  with  GST  (Fig.  3C,  lane  3  and  lane  6),  indicating  the  specific  interaction  of  NS5A-D2  with  NS5B in  vitro.
NS5A-D2 comprises the region 2212-2307 and the NS5Bt peptide consist on the 2421-2990 region of the Hepatitis C virus genotype 1a (isolate H) genome polyprotein.
The far-UV CD spectrum of the apo-state of RD (apo-RD, in the absence of calcium) was typical of a predominantly unfolded protein, as shown by the strong negative π0-π* band around 200 nm (Fig. 1). 
Here, we have characterized the structural and hydrodynamic properties of the RTX Repeat Domain (RD) of the CyaA toxin from Bordetella pertussis. This 701-amino acid long domain contains about 40 RTX motifs. We showed that, in the absence of calcium, RD was natively disordered, weakly stable, and highly hydrated.
In summary, CD and NMR data indicate that the apo-form of RD was largely unfolded with a weak secondary and tertiary structure content, while calcium binding triggered the folding of the protein into a compact and β-rich (>30-35%) conformation.
Upon addition of 2 mm calcium to apo-RD, secondary structures were formed, as revealed by the concomitant intensity decrease of the π0-π* band and the increase of the n′-π* band in the holo-RD spectrum, as previously reported (10, 26).
In summary, CD and NMR data indicate that the apo-form of RD was largely unfolded with a weak secondary and tertiary structure content, while calcium binding triggered the folding of the protein into a compact and β-rich (>30-35%) conformation.
Thermal-induced unfolding of RD was followed by intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan at various calcium concentrations. The ratio of fluorescence intensities at 360 and 320 nm (rFI360/320) was used to follow the unfolding of RD (Fig. 4A). The van't Hoff free enthalpy (ΔHvH) and temperature of half-melting (Tm) were then determined. As shown in Fig. 4B, both Tm and ΔHvH increased with calcium concentrations to reach a plateau above 1.5-2 mm. We obtained similar results from thermal-induced denaturation of RD followed by far- and near-UV CD (data not shown). All together these data indicated that apo-RD was unstable, as expected for a disordered state, while holo-RD was strongly stabilized by calcium binding.

The one-dimensional spectrum of apo-RD in the presence of the denaturant GdnHCl (5.3 m) showed no evident secondary chemical shifts, with all peaks appearing at the expected frequencies for an unfolded protein, the so-called “random-coil” chemical shifts (Fig. 2A). The low chemical-shift dispersion was consistent with a protein with no stable secondary and tertiary structures.

The low chemical-shift dispersion was consistent with a protein with no stable secondary and tertiary structures. The spectrum of the apo-form under native conditions also showed very poor chemical shift dispersion, and resembled that of the protein denatured in GdnHCl, but with somewhat narrower lines. Noticeably, the bands of the apo-RD spectrum were strikingly narrow for a 701-residue long protein, suggesting that apo-RD had a highly dynamic structure in which most of its side-chains could freely reorient in solution. These observations suggested that apo-RD was mainly natively disordered." as they test both apo-RD alone and with denaturant (see fig.2a) and "As shown in Fig. 2C, The nOe build-up curves obtained for apo-RD in 5.3 m GdnHCl showed practically no transfer of saturation, as expected for the disordered conformations adopted by the protein in these conditions. Apo-RD in the absence of denaturant showed also very limited nOes, albeit significantly higher than that of RD in GdnHCl.
In summary, CD and NMR data indicate that the apo-form of RD was largely unfolded with a weak secondary and tertiary structure content, while calcium binding triggered the folding of the protein into a compact and β-rich (>30-35%) conformation.
As both states were monomeric (see below), the short T2 value (characteristic of slow dynamic processes) of holo-RD mainly reflected the compactness of the folded protein, while the T2 value of apo-RD most likely resulted from the fast internal motions within the unstructured conformations of the Ca2+-free polypeptide. The high β-sheet content of holo-RD, as evidenced by the envelope of upfield-shifted Hα signals, also strongly suggested that the observed line-broadening resulted from a calcium-induced folding-compaction process.
The NMR spectrum of calcium-bound RD was drastically different. First, it exhibited an increase of the envelope of upfield-shifted Hα protons, providing direct evidence that holo-RD was more structured, with a β-sheet content (calculated as above) of at least 30-35%. Second, the signals became very broad as expected for a compact protein of 72.6 kDa. The line broadening of the 1H spectrum reflected a major change in the dynamic behavior of the protein upon calcium binding." and "The high β-sheet content of holo-RD, as evidenced by the envelope of upfield-shifted Hα signals, also strongly suggested that the observed line-broadening resulted from a calcium-induced folding-compaction process." and "In contrast, holo-RD showed a very efficient transfer of saturation: the apparent cross-relaxation rate of the holo-form (σ = 3.1 ± 0.1 s-1) was respectively, 14- and 100-fold higher than that of apo-RD or that of apo-RD in the presence of GdnHCl. Therefore, the holo state was much more compact than the apo-form.
In summary, CD and NMR data indicate that the apo-form of RD was largely unfolded with a weak secondary and tertiary structure content, while calcium binding triggered the folding of the protein into a compact and β-rich (>30-35%) conformation.
Equilibrium AUC experiments confirmed that apo-RD and holo-RD had both a same molecular mass of 73 kDa (Table 1), while velocity AUC indicated that the two states displayed different sedimentation coefficients (values of 2.5 S and 4.5 S for the apo and holo states, respectively) resulting from distinct hydrodynamic properties.

As shown in Fig. 5A, holo-RD eluted at a retention volume (RV) of 13.8 ml. This RV value was close to that expected for a globular protein of 73 kDa (RV ∼15 ml). In marked contrast, apo-RD eluted at a retention volume of 10.4 ml, a value corresponding to a globular protein of ∼600 kDa. In both cases, the molecular mass determined on-line by static light scattering corresponded to that of the monomeric RD protein (Fig. 5B and Table 1). Hence, the low retention volume of apo-RD was not due to oligomerization.

Upon addition of 2 mM calcium to apo-RD, secondary structures were formed, as revealed by the concomitant intensity decrease of the0-* band and the increase of the n-* band in the holo-RD spectrum, as previously reported (10, 26). The structures of holo-RD were readily denatured upon addition of 5MGdnHCl,leading to a spectrum similar to that of the apo-state.

The NMR spectrum of calcium-bound RD was drastically different. First, it exhibited an increase of the envelope of upfield-shifted Ha protons, providing direct evidence that holo-RD was more structured, with a-sheet content (calculated as above) of at least 30–35%. Second, the signals became very broad as expected for a compact protein of 72.6 kDa. The line broadening of the 1H spectrum reflected a major change in the dynamic behavior of the protein upon calcium binding.

In agreement with these data, quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS) analysis showed that upon calcium binding, RD was strongly compacted with its hydrodynamic radius (RH) decreasing from about 7 nm to about 3 nm (Table 1).

The ratio of fluorescence intensities at 360 and 320 nm (rFI360/320) was used tofollow the unfolding of RD (Fig. 4A).

The 1H-NMR spectra of ERD10 and ERD14 (Fig. 3A; only ERD10 is shown) also suggest their disordered nature, because the chemical shift dispersion is narrower than is typical for globular proteins. For globular proteins, 1H chemical shifts usually spread out in the region 9.5 to 6.0 ppm, whereas for IDPs, they are usually confined in the region 8.0 to 8.5 ppm (Dyson and Wright, 2004).
In SDS-PAGE, they show a characteristic low mobility: the real molecular mass of ERD10 is 29 kD but it runs at 45 kD, whereas the real molecular mass of ERD14 is 20 kD but it runs at 37 kD (Fig. 2A). This high apparent molecular mass caused by a highly hydrophilic character is often diagnostic of IDPs (Tompa, 2002). In addition, both proteins are heat stable (Fig. 2B) and are very sensitive to proteases (Fig. 2A).
The CD spectra of ERD10 and ERD14 with a minimum close to 200 nm (Fig. 3B) are also typical of disordered proteins, because regular secondary structural elements, such as the α-helix and the β-sheet, in globular proteins give characteristic spectral peaks at 208, 222, and 214 nm, whereas a large negative peak at approximately 200 nm is characteristic of the coil conformation that dominates in IDPs (Receveur-Brechot et al., 2005).
Narrow peak dispersion in the 1H dimension of the 1H-15N HSQC indicates that ERD10 is an intrinsically disordered protein (Fig. 1).
In SDS-PAGE, they show a characteristic low mobility: the real molecular mass of ERD10 is 29 kD but it runs at 45 kD, whereas the real molecular mass of ERD14 is 20 kD but it runs at 37 kD (Fig. 2A). This high apparent molecular mass caused by a highly hydrophilic character is often diagnostic of IDPs (Tompa, 2002). In addition, both proteins are heat stable (Fig. 2B) and are very sensitive to proteases (Fig. 2A).
The polypeptide chain of IDPs is more accessible to proteases than that of globular proteins, which results in much higher protease sensitivity, and this is diagnostic for their open structures. This was tested with proteases of broad substrate specificity (subtilisin and proteinase K) and proteases of narrow substrate specificity (trypsin and chymotrypsin); the pattern of the digestion was similar for all proteases, so we show only the results of proteinase K (Fig. 2A). ERD10 and ERD14 do not show any ordered motifs, which would show resistance against proteolysis.
Liposome binding suggested a possible effect of ERD10 and ERD14 on membrane fluidity. This was analyzed by fluorescence anisotropy measurements, which showed no effect of ERD10 or ERD14 on phosphatidylcholine (PC):PS (1:1) vesicles (Fig. 9).
Our results show that these intrinsically disordered proteins have chaperone activity of rather wide substrate specificity and that they interact with phospholipid vesicles through electrostatic forces.
Another putative mechanism of the protective function of ERD10 and ERD14 is membrane binding and stabilization. We could address this cryoprotective effect by analyzing their binding of PLVs and their effects on membrane fluidity. Generally, the fluorescence anisotropy is characteristic of the movement rate of the fluorescent dye in the phospholipid layer, which showed no difference in the presence or absence of ERD10 and ERD14.
This result suggests that the interaction is electrostatic, affecting membranes only peripherally, via phospholipid head groups.
The interaction of ERD10 and ERD14 with phospholipid vesicles (PLVs) was analyzed with mini gel filtration columns, as described in “Materials and Methods.” The analysis and comparison with the behavior of a positive control, calpain domain III, which shows calcium-dependent phospholipid binding, and a negative control, BSA, which does not bind to vesicles either in the absence or the presence of calcium (Tompa et al., 2001), confirm that ERD10 and ERD14 bind to PLVs. The interaction was statistically significant, as suggested by Student's t test (P = 0.003 and 0.056 for ERD10 and ERD14, respectively). Under the given conditions, approximately 2 μg of ERD10 and 2.5 μg of ERD14 were bound to 25 μg of PLVs, out of 15 μg total (Fig. 8A).Liposome binding suggested a possible effect of ERD10 and ERD14 on membrane fluidity. This was analyzed by fluorescence anisotropy measurements, which showed no effect of ERD10 or ERD14 on phosphatidylcholine (PC):PS (1:1) vesicles (Fig. 9).
Here, citrate synthase was incubated at an elevated temperature and aggregation was followed by an increase in absorbance. ERD10 and ERD14 at an equimolar concentration showed significant protective activity (Fig. 5), slowing the rate of aggregation to about half of its control value; this effect was significantly higher than that of BSA but fell short of that of HSP90. Upon increasing ERD10 and ERD14 concentrations further, the protective effect did not change much and did not reach the efficiency of HSP90 (Table I).
Both ERD10 and ERD14 showed significant protective effects on the thermal aggregation of firefly luciferase at a 2× molar excess (Fig. 6). Under these conditions, aggregation was almost completely inhibited, similar to the effect of HSP90 (Table I). BSA was practically ineffective in this assay.
ERD10, ERD14, and HSP90 had similar protective effects on the enzyme activity of lysozyme at substoichiometric ratios of lysozyme:chaperone (7:1; Fig. 7; Table I). Although the time course of the loss of enzyme activity was somewhat different in the presence of ERD10, ERD14, and HSP90, their protective effects, as expressed by residual enzyme activity after 25 min of incubation, were commensurate. BSA, again, had a negligible effect.
To investigate these functions of ERD10 and ERD14, we studied their protective effects on the heat-induced loss of enzyme activity and/or aggregation of four different substrates. The selected assays represent different modes and mechanisms of possible chaperone action and included thermal inactivation of ADH, thermal aggregation of firefly luciferase and citrate synthase, and the chemically induced inactivation of lysozyme. In the analyses shown here, ERD10 and ERD14 demonstrated marked effects on the prevention of aggregation/deactivation of protein substrates.
The water content of BSA solution freezes completely between −53.5 and −55.6°C. In contrast to the BSA solution, the bound water fraction for the ERD10 solution changes significantly even below −25°C. It is diminishing steadily from the value of 0.055 ± 0.002 at −25.5°C to the value of 0.024 ± 0.002 at −46.7°C. The remaining mobile water fraction freezes completely at around −48°C, at a much higher temperature than in the case of the BSA solution.
The most striking difference between the two protein types lies in the minimal protein concentration necessary to suppress the SEP or the hysteresis: it is between 8 and 12.5 mg/cm3 for ERD10, whereas there is a big SEP even at a BSA concentration of 25 mg/cm3. These results prove the more pronounced water-binding activity of the IUP ERD10 than of the globular protein BSA.
Further, hydration of this protein and that of BSA show significant differences, in the sense that hydration of the IUP ERD10 is rather heterogeneous, with an array of distinct binding sites. The steady and steep increase in the amount of unfrozen water on heating can be interpreted as melting of ice phases at different temperatures. The melting of different ice phases can be interpreted as a change in the motional state (dynamics) of water molecules bound at different binding sites.
The water content of BSA solution freezes completely between −53.5 and −55.6°C. In contrast to the BSA solution, the bound water fraction for the ERD10 solution changes significantly even below −25°C. It is diminishing steadily from the value of 0.055 ± 0.002 at −25.5°C to the value of 0.024 ± 0.002 at −46.7°C. The remaining mobile water fraction freezes completely at around −48°C, at a much higher temperature than in the case of the BSA solution.
The most striking difference between the two protein types lies in the minimal protein concentration necessary to suppress the SEP or the hysteresis: it is between 8 and 12.5 mg/cm3 for ERD10, whereas there is a big SEP even at a BSA concentration of 25 mg/cm3. These results prove the more pronounced water-binding activity of the IUP ERD10 than of the globular protein BSA.

Analysis of the secondary chemical shifts using chemical shift indices [23] supports the hypothesis of am absence of secondary structure in the region 81-92 (Fig. 3A).
 The second spans residues 61-210 [hfra(61-210)]. As described previously [11], unless otherwise protected, this construct degrades spontaneously to produce a fragment comprising residues 75-210 [hfra(75-210)]. However, we found that use of the Complete anti-protease cocktail (Roche) prevents proteolytic cleavage.
All 279 residues of the kinase domain construct have been modeled except for residues 436–455 and 570–575, which had no interpretable electron density.
The loop 436–455, not located in the structure, has been identified from its sequence as a potential PEST region (Watanabe et al., 1995).
The 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of NS5A-D2 (Con1 strain) displays a narrow 1HN chemical shift dispersion limited to 1 ppm, as expected for a mainly disordered domain (Fig. 1A).
The NS5A fragment used in this publication was derived from the Hepacivirus C UniProtKB:Q9WIK7. IDR is 100% identical to the Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (isolate Con1) polyprotein.
 The final set of 28 low energy structures that fulfill the experimental restraints displays a well defined small structural motif (from Met313 to Ala317) in PepD2-WT (Fig. 5 and Table 1; PDB code 2M5L), whereas the N and C termini remain highly flexible.
The NS5A fragment used in this publication was derived from the Hepacivirus C UniProtKB:Q9WIK7. IDR is 100% identical to the Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (isolate Con1) polyprotein. PepD2-WT comprises the region 2280-2299 of the Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (isolate Con1) genome polyprotein.
The affinity between CypA and the PW turn containing PepD2-WT peptide (KD = 0.5 mm) is three times better than the one involving the random coil PepD2-I315G peptide (KD = 1.4 mm).
The NS5A fragment used in this publication was derived from the Hepacivirus C UniProtKB:Q9WIK7. IDR is 100% identical to the Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (isolate Con1) polyprotein. PepD2-WT comprises the region 2280-2299 of the Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (isolate Con1) genome polyprotein.
Region 2280-2299 is mainly unstructured, as shown by its large negative ellipticity at 200 nm and moderate ellipticity at 190 nm in the far-UV CD spectra (Figure 7).
The NS5A fragment used in this publication was derived from the Hepacivirus C UniProtKB:Q9WIK7. IDR is 100% identical to the Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (isolate Con1) polyprotein.
The chemical shifts of the backbone amide proton resonances are clustered in a narrow 1.3 ppm window from 7.2 to 8.5 ppm, and the dispersion of the 15N chemical shifts is narrowed in 19.2 ppm, as typical signs of an unfolded protein (23).
 As shown in Figure 2a, multinuclear (CA, CB, HA, and CO) chemical shift indexing, consensus CSI (30) values are zeros, suggesting that NS5A-D2 largely exists in a random coil conformation.
The steady-state heteronuclear 1H−15N NOE for the backbone amide of NS5A-D2 exhibited a relatively featureless and flattened variation with the amino acid sequences (Figure 3a), as seen in unfolded proteins (33).
The high T2 values measured for NS5A-D2 indicate large amplitude motions on the nanosecond to picosecond time scale, which is characteristic of a random coil conformation.
As shown in Figure 5a, the CD spectrum of NS5A-D2 without TFE exhibits a minimum near 201 nm, with a slight negative ellipticity at about 222 nm, suggesting that it is mainly unfolded.
Our NMR results showed that perturbations in the chemical shifts were observed in 1H−15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled NS5A-D2 in the presence of 5 mM of the MK-17 peptide (Figure 7a), whereas the titration with the peptide SP-24 caused a heavy precipitate upon its addition (data not shown).
NS5A-D2 interacts with NS5B MK-17 peptide. 
NS5A-D2 comprises the region 2212-2307 of the Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (isolate Con1) genome polyprotein. The MK-17 peptide consist on the 139−155 residues of NS5B, which corresponds to 2558-2574 region of the Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (isolate Con1) genome polyprotein.
The affinity between CypA and the PW turn containing PepD2-WT peptide (KD = 0.5 mm) is three times better than the one involving the random coil PepD2-I315G peptide (KD = 1.4 mm).

The CD spectrum of NS5A-D3 is typical for a poorly folded protein with a large negative peak centered at 198 nm.
By comparison with the NS5A-D3 spectra recorded alone, we identified the residues involved in interaction with CypA based on chemical shift perturbations and/or peak broadening. 
The purified protein exhibited the expected mass (9925 Da) as determined by mass spectroscopy (not shown). By SDS–PAGE, NS5A-D3 has an apparent molecular weight (MW) of ∼20 kDa (Fig. 2A). This discrepancy is probably due to the primary sequence of NS5A-D3, which includes many acidic residues and prolines.
The anomalous electrophoretic mobility is frequently observed in intrinsically disordered proteins.
The circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of NS5A-D3 exhibits a single negative peak centered at 198 nm (Fig. 2C) that is typical of unfolded polypeptide. The lack of characteristic minima around 208 and 222 nm indicative of α-helix, or the minimum around 215 nm that points to β-sheet elements, confirms the absence of regular secondary structure in NS5A-D3.
The 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of NS5A-D3 (Fig. 3A) exhibits a rather narrow 1H chemical shift dispersion limited to 0.75 ppm. NS5A-D3 resonances are clustered in three regions of the NMR spectrum corresponding to, respectively, the glycines, the serine and threonine and finally the other residues. This clustering and the limited dispersion in proton dimension are typical of non-structured polypeptides. 
The resulting CSI consensus values are zero (Fig 3B, bottom), confirming the absence in NS5A-D3 of stable secondary structure elements even at the local level.
Increases in EFRET,apparent with increasing concentrations of RNA provide evidence for binding (Figure 1A). A plateau in the EFRET,apparent indicates that the binding of cy3NS5ADII to cy5rU20 was saturated and reached its equilibrium after the addition of 50 nM RNA substrate. 
The increase in EFRET,apparent is again indicative of binding. A higher maximum EFRET,apparent of 0.4 was reached with CypA, suggesting that NS5ADII bound more efficiently to CypA than RNA.
With increasing concentrations of NS5B, a significant change in anisotropy was observed, which confirms the formation of a protein–protein complex with NS5B (Figure 1C).
NS5B peptide used corresponds to the 2442-3011 region of the Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (isolate Con1) genome polyprotein.
As illustrated in Fig. 8, the sole mutation I315G in NS5A almost completely abolished viral replication that was close to the background as determined with the replicon encoding an inactive NS5B RNA-polymerase (GND mutant). The replication levels corresponding to the I315G and P314A mutations, respectively, were similar.
Hence, the short PW turn structural motif in the mainly disordered NS5A-D2 domain plays an essential role for HCV RNA replication.
The NS5A fragment used in this publication was derived from the Hepacivirus C UniProtKB:Q9WIK7. IDR is 100% identical to the Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (isolate Con1) polyprotein. PepD2-WT comprises the region 2280-2299 of 
PW turn corresponds to the 2290-2292 region of the Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (isolate Con1) genome polyprotein (P316 -W318 of the Ns5B protein). Although the authors describes this region as a small structural motif, the region is to short to form any secondary structure so is interpreted as disordered here.
The final model contains residues: Sb 25–93, Sx 188–259, Sn1 7–83 and Sn2 131–204 for complex I; Sb 28–96, Sx 189–261, Sn1 12–83 and Sn2 132–203 for complex II; Sb 26–94, Sx 186–259, Sn1 11–83 and Sn2 132–204 for complex III; 19 water molecules; 13 Sr2+ ions; and 7 MPD molecules.
The N-terminal region of synaptobrevin (Sb) not visible in the crystal structure spans residues 2-24 in chain A and 2-27 in chain B.
1DHN RDCs from the majority of the sequence follow the classically observed inverted bell-shaped distribution along the primary sequence, indicative of an unfolded peptide chain.
NMR chemical shift titration studies of the NT:PX complex show that resonances of NT from throughout the interaction region (residues 473–492) experience line broadening (Figure S1, Supporting Information). 
No detectable RD is measured in free NT (Figure S3, Supporting Information), confirming the rapid nature of the exchange between the three helical substates and the unfolded state.
Multinuclear RD provides an atomic resolution map of the molecular recognition trajectory of intrinsically disordered NT from the highly dynamic free-state equilibrium to the bound state, revealing a three-state interaction process whose binding modes and kinetics are regulated by the intrinsic dynamics of both proteins. 
Structural analysis of the different steps of NT binding to PX. (A) 13C′ secondary chemical shifts of the bound state of NT (derived by adding ΔωAB from the consensus three-state exchange model of Figure 4 to free-state shifts, red bars) and ASTEROIDS minimum ensemble selection against these shifts (blue line). A single ensemble substate, reporting on helix 476–489 populated to 100%, best reproduces the experimental data.
NMR chemical shift titration studies of the NT:PX complex show that resonances of NT from throughout the interaction region (residues 473–492) experience line broadening (Figure S1, Supporting Information).
We note that the backbone conformational propensities remain stable with temperature in the unfolded regions of NT, while the predominantly helical region (residues 476–492) shows a slight increase in helical propensity (around 5–7%) at lower temperatures as judged from temperature-corrected (80)13Cα chemical shifts (Figure S5).
The authors performed paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) and SAXS assays in order to build a an representative ensamble of conformers. They demonstrate that both Sic1 and pSic1 conformer population contain several transient secondary structure.
[PTM -phosphorylation-, which indeed is necessary to induce the function of Sic1 does not have any impact on the protein conformation itself] The authors state: Both Sic1 and pSic1 are intrinsically disordered proteins, best described as ensembles of rapidly interconverting, diverse conformers.
When phosphorylated, Sic1 interacts with Cdc4 but maintains its IDP conformation. The authors demonstrate that pSic1 can interact through multiple suboptimal CPD sites, and this generate a very dynamic interaction without any disorder to order transition.

Sic1-GFP exhibited a thin and flexible tail-like structure with a temporarily appearing and disappearing small globule at the N-terminal end, together with the C-terminal GFP. The R_2D histogram for the IDR was best fitted to a double Gaussian with peaks at 12.2 +/- 0.66 and 20.5 +/- 2.14 nm. The IDR is fully disordered in both shorter and longer states, as judged from its mean height of 0.4–0.5 nm in both metastable states 
The authors of the publication characterized an engineered fusion protein, i.e. recombinant Sic1 fused with GFP.
The large number around 190 indicates that as much as about 65% of the whole protein is loosely folded, with only the remaining C-terminal region (encompassing about 95aa) being fully extended. The remarkable difference between 30 and 190 indicates that a large segment containing about 160 residues undergoes a transition between fully unstructured and loosely folded conformations.
The authors of the publication characterized an engineered fusion protein, i.e. recombinant Sic1 fused with GFP.
The very small spread of the resonance frequencies for amide protons (between 7.8 and 8.7 ppm; see frame in Fig.2A) together with the scarcity of nuclear Overhauser effects in the amide-amide region are typical of a protein without any stable secondary structure.
In the case of NTAIL, RSN = 19 Å and RSU = 35 Å. Therefore, the Stokes radius experimentally measured for NTAIL (27 Å) is not compatible with a monomeric, globular protein. Rather, such a large value of the Stokes radius can be attributed either to dimerization or to an extended conformation.
The IDR showed a temporarily appearing and disappearing small globule at the N terminus corresponding to Box1 (Fig. 4d). Except for this, the IDR was observed to be fully disordered (with mean height of 0.4−0.5 nm) (Extended Data Fig. 5a).
The IDR showed a temporarily appearing and disappearing small globule at the N terminus corresponding to Box1 (Fig. 4d).
he H2 value of 0.8 nm is larger than the height of fully disordered regions, indicating that Box1 and Box2 are both partially ordered, even in their lower height states.

The spectra are dominated by the peaks of the free proteins, but signals specific to the NTAIL–PXD complex become evident at the higher protein concentration. The measured mass of the complex (21,187.4 ± 0.61 Da) corresponds closely to the sum of the theoretical values expected for NTAIL with the initial methionine and PXD without the initial methionine (21,187.46 Da), indicating a 1:1 stoichiometry.
The molecular mass (MM) calculated from the forward scattering intensity I(0) is 23.5 ± 2 kDa, in agreement with the value expected for a 1:1 stoichiometric complex (21.3 kDa), thus suggesting that the complex did form in solution.
The high value of Rg indicated that the overall structure of the NTAILHN–XD complex is not compact. 
As shown in Figure 3B, the three NTAIL deletion proteins migrate in SDS-PAGE with an apparent MM of either 20 kDa (NTAILΔ3 and NTAILΔ1) or 18 kDa (NTAILΔ2,3) (expected MMs are 14.5, 13.4, and 11.5 kDa, respectively). This abnormal migratory behavior has already been documented for NTAIL, where mass spectrometry analysis and N-terminal sequencing gave the expected results (Longhi et al. 2003). The anomalous electrophoretic mobility is therefore due to a rather high content of acidic residues, as frequently observed in intrinsically disordered proteins (Tompa 2002).

As expected for intrinsically disordered protein subdomains, the Stokes radius (RS) values, as inferred by gel filtration (27 ± 3 Å, 22 ± 3 Å, and 27 ± 3 Å for NTAILΔ3, NTAILΔ2,3, and NTAILΔ1, respectively), are consistent with extended conformations (see Materials and Methods).

The high value of Rg indicated that the overall structure of the NTAILHN–XD complex is not compact. The distances distribution function inferred from the scattering curve of the NTAILHN–XD complex exhibits a maximum at 20 Å, with a shoulder at about 30 Å and a long tail up to 146 Å, typical of an elongated object (see Fig. 2A).
Binding affinities between XD and NTAIL constructs were established using 180–225 RU of immobilized XD and NTAIL concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 μM (see Materials and Methods). Dosage-dependent binding was observed in this range. Reactions conformed to a 1:1 ligand-substrate (Langmuir) binding model, exhibiting an excellent fit (i.e., a χ2 value <1 and residuals within the range of ±2) following global analysis of sensorgrams.
In contrast, removal of either Box3 alone or Box2 plus Box3 results in a strong decrease (three orders of magnitude) in the equilibrium dissociation constant, where NTAILΔ3 and NTAILΔ2,3 display similar binding affinities (see Table 1). The strong decrease in the affinity resulting from removal of Box3 clearly indicates that Box2 is not the sole region involved in binding to XD, and attests that Box3 also plays a role in the interaction with XD, as already suggested by SAXS studies.

The far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra of NTAIL deletion proteins at neutral pH are typical of unstructured proteins, as seen by their large negative ellipticity at 198 nm and very low ellipticity at 185 nm (Fig. 4A–C).

After mixing NTAILHNFC with different molar excesses of XD, the observed CD spectra differed from the corresponding theoretical average curves calculated from the individual spectra. 
Since the theoretical average curves correspond to the spectra that would be expected if no structural variations occur, deviations from these curves indicate structural transitions. The results obtained in the presence of a threefold molar excess of XD indicate a random coil to α-helix transition, as judged by the much more pronounced minima at 208 nm and 222 nm, and by the higher ellipticity at 190 nm of the experimentally observed spectrum compared to the corresponding theoretical average curve (see Fig. 5A).
Removal of Box3 significantly reduces, but does not abrogate, the folding ability of NTAIL. Indeed, the experimental CD spectrum does not significantly deviate from the average curve in the 200–260 nm region, but it considerably deviates from the average curve in the 185–195 region (58% mean increase of ellipticity) (Fig. 5B), thus supporting partial folding ability of NTAILΔ3 in the presence of XD.
Measles virus (MeV) nucleoprotein Box 3 region is comprised within the residues 517-525
Conversely, removal of Box1 does not affect the folding ability of NTAIL, as the deviations from the average spectrum are similar to those observed with the full-length form (Fig. 5, cf. D and A). The mean increase in ellipticity in the 185–195 nm region (77%) and the decrease in the ellipticity value at 220 nm (46%) observed with NTAILΔ1, are comparable to the corresponding values observed with NTAILHNFC (70% and 46%, respectively).
Measles virus (MeV) nucleoprotein Box 1 region is comprised within the residues 401-420.
The IDR showed a temporarily appearing and disappearing small globule at the N terminus corresponding to Box1 (Fig. 4d).

As shown in Figure 7, the same peaks undergoing the large displacement in the NTAILHN–XD complex are also observed in the NTAILΔ3–XD complex. In particular, among these peaks, the occurrence in both complexes of the 11 peaks that undergo the random coil to α-helix transition (see Fig. 7, stars), provides further support that the helical folding occurs within Box2.
The high value of Rg indicated that the overall structure of the NTAILHN–XD complex is not compact. The distances distribution function inferred from the scattering curve of the NTAILHN–XD complex exhibits a maximum at 20 Å, with a shoulder at about 30 Å and a long tail up to 146 Å, typical of an elongated object (see Fig. 2A). The bump most probably corresponds to the intramolecular distances within the globular portion of the complex (see below), while the tail indicates that NTAIL possesses regions with an extended conformation.
As shown in Fig. 1B, NTAILdisplays an abnormally slow migration in SDS-PAGE even after heat denaturation. In particular, it migrates with an apparent molecular mass (MM) of 20 kDa, whereas the expected MM is 15 kDa. This abnormal behavior has already been observed in the case of the intrinsically disordered MV PNT (41) as well as in other intrinsically disordered proteins and can most likely be ascribed to their unusual sequence composition (30).
Thus, the V of NTAIL calculated by DLS is about 3 times larger than the value expected for a globular protein and half of that expected for a denatured, fully unfolded protein. Rather, these hydrodynamic properties are consistent with the hypothesis that NTAIL is a native premolten globule (31).
The far-UV CD spectrum of NTAIL at neutral pH is typical of an unstructured protein, as seen from its large negative ellipticity at 198 nm and very low ellipticity at 185 nm (Fig. 2B). However, the observed ellipticity values at 200 and 222 nm (−9700 and −2400 degrees cm2 dmol−1, respectively) (Fig. 2B) are consistent with the existence of some residual secondary structure, typical of the premolten globule state (39).
NCORE was obtained by limited proteolysis of purified N as described in Ref. 4, followed by gel filtration (data not shown).
Measles virus (MeV) nucleoprotein NCORE region is comprised within 1–399 residues. Its obtention trough this methodology  proves that 400-525 region is susceptible to proteolysis, hallmark of intrinsic disorder.
When both lysates were mixed, the IMAC resin selectively pulled down NTAIL together with an additional protein that has the same electrophoretic mobility of P (Fig. 5B,lane Nt + P). The identity of this protein band was confirmed by Western blotting using an anti-P mAb (data not shown), thus proving that the NTAIL domain on its own is able to bind its physiological partner in bacterial lysates.
After mixing NTAIL with different molar excesses of PCT, the observed CD spectra of the mixtures differ from the corresponding theoretical average curves calculated from the individual spectra. Since the theoretical average curves correspond to the spectra that would be expected if no structural variations occur, deviations from these curves point out structural transitions.
Therefore, these results indicate that NTAIL undergoes an induced folding upon binding to PCT.

Since the theoretical average curves correspond to the spectra that would be expected if no structural variations occur, deviations from these curves point out structural transitions.
In the presence of molar excesses of PCT, a random coil to α-helix transition can be observed, as indicated by the much more pronounced minima at 208 and 222 nm and by the higher ellipticity at 190 nm of the experimentally observed spectra compared with the corresponding theoretical average curves (Fig. 6A).
Therefore, these results indicate that NTAIL undergoes an induced folding upon binding to PCT.
Therefore, the observedRg indicates that NTAIL is not globular. However, the protein is more compact than a random coil, suggesting that it possesses some residual structure.
The Kratky plot of NTAIL displays a bump atq ≈ 0.08 Å−1 followed by a plateau forq > 0.15 Å−1 (see Fig. 3B). The absence of a maximum clearly indicates that NTAIL is not globular and does not possess a tightly packed core. However, the observed bump may be indicative of some residual structure.
In the case of NTAIL, the RS andRg values obtained by DLS and SAXS, respectively, lead to a ratio of 1.1, which is consistent with a premolten globule.

The high value of Rg indicated that the overall structure of the NTAILHN–XD complex is not compact.
The spectrum shows a very broad, bimodal charge-state distribution (CSD), indicating structural heterogeneity consistent with the intrinsically disordered nature of this protein.
The rest of the spectrum is characterized by a broad peak envelope that spans the region between the 10+ and the 24+ ions, with main charge state 16+. This component corresponds to disordered conformations, characterized by low compactness.
 In this case, two slightly different conformations are found to populate the compact state of the NTAIL–PXD complex (charge states 8+ to 10+). Average CCS of 1326 and 1422 Å2 can be derived for the two main peaks detectable for the 8+ charge state. This result suggests that the compact state of the complex is characterized by further structural heterogeneity. Thus, although its overall ionization suggests a collapsed structure, its arrival-time distribution reveals distinct peaks rather than the single peak typically observed for normally folded proteins. 
The spectra are dominated by the peaks of the free proteins, but signals specific to the NTAIL–PXD complex become evident at the higher protein concentration. The measured mass of the complex (21,187.4 ± 0.61 Da) corresponds closely to the sum of the theoretical values expected for NTAIL with the initial methionine and PXD without the initial methionine (21,187.46 Da), indicating a 1:1 stoichiometry.
Intermediate exchange between NTAIL and XD, especially at the binding interface, caused significant peak broadening thus reducing the number of resonance assignments possible for the NTAIL–XD complex.
At low XD concentrations (0.037, 0.075, and 0.150 mM), most resonances in the HSQC experience no chemical shift changes (residues 401–474), some resonances undergo fast exchange and experience chemical shift changes with minimal line broadening (residues 475–482 and residues 507–525), and some resonances undergo intermediate exchange and experience significant line broadening (residues 483–506). 
For all the affected resonances (residues 475–525), small chemical shift differences were observed when increasing the XD concentration from 0.3 to 0.6 mM, suggesting that binding is saturated.

The sole intermolecular hydrogen bonding interaction observed in a chimeric crystal structure of N486–505:PXD involves S491 of NTAIL interacting with K489 and D493 of PXD (7). Mutation of N (S491) has been shown to abrogate the NTAIL:PXD interaction—this is also the case under our experimental conditions (Fig. 3D)—and to significantly decrease viral transcription in vivo (11). The critical nature of this interaction for LLPS was demonstrated via the S491L mutation, which resulted in suppression of phase separation.

Size-exclusion chromatography was employed to estimate the Rh values of the three sets of model IDPs (Table 2). Experimental Rh values of wt NTAIL and wt PNT4 (2.71 ± 0.09 and 2.34 ± 0.11 nm, respectively) are close to the theoretical ones (Table 1) and similar to the previously determined ones [9].
Experimentally determined Rh matches the theoretical Rh for IDPs [Marsh & Forman-Kay, 2010].
Rt (nm) = 2.64
Native MS was employed to assess the conformational properties of the three sets of IDPs. In this approach, the CSDs resulting from the nanoESI process reflect the overall compactness and relative amounts of the main conformers in the original solution [17,18,22]. Native-MS spectra obtained under non-denaturing conditions for the three variants of NTAIL (Figure 4a), NFM, and PNT4 (Figure S3) display multimodal CSDs, highlighting the heterogeneous conformational ensemble typical of IDPs.
Figure S2. Far-UV CD spectra of model IDPs. CD spectra of NTAIL (a), NFM (b), and PNT4 (c) variants.
Typical random coil-like far-UV CD spectrum is displayed for NTAIL.
(b) 1-->H–15-->N HSQC spectrum of the F1 insert shows that it is predominantly unstructured as indicated by the poor signal dispersion, although some weaker signals may suggest some ordered elements.
In the talin F0 structure, the secondary-structure elements begin at residue 3, but in kindlin-1, there are an additional 11 residues (MLSSGDLTSAS) at the N-terminus, which are unstructured (Fig. 2b), as indicated by the lack of long-range nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOEs).
WT KorB, (N⌬150)KorB, (C⌬60)KorB, and (C⌬105)KorB all exhibited a definite peak in the Kratky plots, a signature of globular structure, although the
data did not go to zero at high Q value. This is indicative of some
degree of random coil component (40), again in line with the predictions of intrinsic disorder and the CD (Fig. 2B) and NMR (Fig. 3) measurements.
The disordered regions are also likely to be important for
DNA partitioning, as many of the partition proteins need to
span two DNA duplexes (or several proteins) to carry out their
function. Flexible interactions between the central and C-terminal domains of a ParB protein have been seen in the crystal
structures of central and C-terminal domains of ParB from P1
plasmid of Escherichia coli bound to different target sequences
The secondary structure content determined from the CD
analysis for (N⌬297)KorB agrees well with the crystal structure
of this domain, whereas that of (N⌬150)KorB agrees with that
predicted from the two known crystal structures of KorB with
random coil at residues 251–297
The disordered regions are also likely to be important for
DNA partitioning, as many of the partition proteins need to

minal domains of a ParB protein have been seen in the crystal

The KorB-N domain, for which no structural information is available, is probably connected to helix 1 of KorB-O via a flexible linker, as indicated by residues Arg117–Tyr137, which are disordered in the crystal structure of the KorB-O–DNA complex.
The KorB-N domain, for which no structural information is available, is probably connected to helix 1 of KorB-O via a flexible linker, as indicated by residues Arg117–Tyr137, which are disordered in the crystal structure of the KorB-O–DNA complex.
In all cases, the CD suggests that the N-terminal 50 amino acids of KorB and the linker between the central and DNA-binding domains are unstructured
The NMR data for the N-ter-
minal domain does show that there is some structure present
(Fig. 3), however, the peaks between 8.0 and 8.5 ppm could arise
from amide protons in either unstructured or alpha-helical regions.
This domain may exists in an equilibrium between a folded and
unfolded state, and the folded and unfolded conformations of
this domain we have generated represent limiting cases.
KorB-O and KorB-C are connected by a linker that is probably flexible, as residue Lys253–Lys294 are disordered in the KorB-O–DNA crystal.

In physiological buffer, the circular dichroism spectra of the full-length dehydrins reveal overall disordered structures with a variable content of poly-Pro helices, a type of elongated secondary structure relying on bridging water molecules.
 As shown in Fig. 3C, the majority of backbone amide proton resonances exhibited poor chemical shift dispersion (~7.9–8.7 ppm), indicating substantial regions of structural disorder. In addition, many resonances were broadened, indicating interconversion between multiple conformations occurring within the "intermediate" NMR timescale. 
 This value is approximately three-fold greater than its theoretical molecular mass of 12.3 kD and could suggest that LBH exists as a higher-order oligomer in solution. However, since determination of molecular mass of proteins from such analysis is highly dependent upon their globular shape, an alternative scenario could be that LBH lacks an intrinsic globular fold allowing it to behave as a structurally disordered polymer.
As shown in Fig. 3B, CD spectrum of LBH in the far-UV region (180–240 nm) is largely characterized by a negative band centered around 200 nm, which is reminiscent of a structurally disordered protein with little or no secondary structure.
Additionally, the CD spectrum of LBH in the near-UV region (240–300 nm) is completely devoid of a band around 280 nm, which would be expected for a non-globular protein with one or more tryptophan residues.
Thus, the molecular mass determined for LBH from ALS analysis on the basis of first principles of hydrodynamics with no assumptions is in an excellent agreement with a theoretical value of 12.3 kD and suggests that LBH exists as a monomer in solution. Additionally, a value of 234 Å for the radius of gyration of LBH strongly suggests that LBH lacks a globular fold and most likely behaves as a rod-like macromolecule.
In Figure 3A, fluorescence spectrum of LBH shows that the single tryptophan residue (Trp-80) within the protein emits with λmax around 350 nm. Given that this is the λmax observed for free tryptophan residues in solution, it can be argued that the tryptophan residue within LBH is completely accessible to the aqueous solvent and that LBH is likely to contain a non-globular fold.
The 1H-NMR spectra of ERD10 and ERD14 (Fig. 3A; only ERD10 is shown) also suggest their disordered nature, because the chemical shift dispersion is narrower than is typical for globular proteins. For globular proteins, 1H chemical shifts usually spread out in the region 9.5 to 6.0 ppm, whereas for IDPs, they are usually confined in the region 8.0 to 8.5 ppm (Dyson and Wright, 2004).
In SDS-PAGE, they show a characteristic low mobility: the real molecular mass of ERD10 is 29 kD but it runs at 45 kD, whereas the real molecular mass of ERD14 is 20 kD but it runs at 37 kD (Fig. 2A). This high apparent molecular mass caused by a highly hydrophilic character is often diagnostic of IDPs (Tompa, 2002). In addition, both proteins are heat stable (Fig. 2B) and are very sensitive to proteases (Fig. 2A).
Herein we present the backbone (1)H, (15)N and (13)C NMR assignment of the 185 amino acid long ERD14 (Early Response to Dehydration 14), which is a K(3)S-type, typical dehydrin of A. thaliana. Secondary chemical shifts as well as NMR relaxation data show that ERD14 is fully disordered under near native conditions, with short regions of somewhat restricted motion and 5-25% helical propensity.
The measured NMR data give clear evidence of the almost complete disordered state of ERD14 under native conditions. SCS values and relaxation parameters fall close to the random coil values along the entire chain (Fig. 2), which suggests that the protein is fully flexible.
The CD spectra of ERD10 and ERD14 with a minimum close to 200 nm (Fig. 3B) are also typical of disordered proteins, because regular secondary structural elements, such as the α-helix and the β-sheet, in globular proteins give characteristic spectral peaks at 208, 222, and 214 nm, whereas a large negative peak at approximately 200 nm is characteristic of the coil conformation that dominates in IDPs (Receveur-Brechot et al., 2005).
The polypeptide chain of IDPs is more accessible to proteases than that of globular proteins, which results in much higher protease sensitivity, and this is diagnostic for their open structures. This was tested with proteases of broad substrate specificity (subtilisin and proteinase K) and proteases of narrow substrate specificity (trypsin and chymotrypsin); the pattern of the digestion was similar for all proteases, so we show only the results of proteinase K (Fig. 2A). ERD10 and ERD14 do not show any ordered motifs, which would show resistance against proteolysis.
Liposome binding suggested a possible effect of ERD10 and ERD14 on membrane fluidity. This was analyzed by fluorescence anisotropy measurements, which showed no effect of ERD10 or ERD14 on phosphatidylcholine (PC):PS (1:1) vesicles (Fig. 9).
Our results show that these intrinsically disordered proteins have chaperone activity of rather wide substrate specificity and that they interact with phospholipid vesicles through electrostatic forces.
Another putative mechanism of the protective function of ERD10 and ERD14 is membrane binding and stabilization. We could address this cryoprotective effect by analyzing their binding of PLVs and their effects on membrane fluidity. Generally, the fluorescence anisotropy is characteristic of the movement rate of the fluorescent dye in the phospholipid layer, which showed no difference in the presence or absence of ERD10 and ERD14.
This result suggests that the interaction is electrostatic, affecting membranes only peripherally, via phospholipid head groups.
The interaction of ERD10 and ERD14 with phospholipid vesicles (PLVs) was analyzed with mini gel filtration columns, as described in “Materials and Methods.” The analysis and comparison with the behavior of a positive control, calpain domain III, which shows calcium-dependent phospholipid binding, and a negative control, BSA, which does not bind to vesicles either in the absence or the presence of calcium (Tompa et al., 2001), confirm that ERD10 and ERD14 bind to PLVs. The interaction was statistically significant, as suggested by Student's t test (P = 0.003 and 0.056 for ERD10 and ERD14, respectively). Under the given conditions, approximately 2 μg of ERD10 and 2.5 μg of ERD14 were bound to 25 μg of PLVs, out of 15 μg total (Fig. 8A).

Here, citrate synthase was incubated at an elevated temperature and aggregation was followed by an increase in absorbance. ERD10 and ERD14 at an equimolar concentration showed significant protective activity (Fig. 5), slowing the rate of aggregation to about half of its control value; this effect was significantly higher than that of BSA but fell short of that of HSP90. Upon increasing ERD10 and ERD14 concentrations further, the protective effect did not change much and did not reach the efficiency of HSP90 (Table I).
Both ERD10 and ERD14 showed significant protective effects on the thermal aggregation of firefly luciferase at a 2× molar excess (Fig. 6). Under these conditions, aggregation was almost completely inhibited, similar to the effect of HSP90 (Table I). BSA was practically ineffective in this assay.
ERD10, ERD14, and HSP90 had similar protective effects on the enzyme activity of lysozyme at substoichiometric ratios of lysozyme:chaperone (7:1; Fig. 7; Table I). Although the time course of the loss of enzyme activity was somewhat different in the presence of ERD10, ERD14, and HSP90, their protective effects, as expressed by residual enzyme activity after 25 min of incubation, were commensurate. BSA, again, had a negligible effect.
To investigate these functions of ERD10 and ERD14, we studied their protective effects on the heat-induced loss of enzyme activity and/or aggregation of four different substrates. The selected assays represent different modes and mechanisms of possible chaperone action and included thermal inactivation of ADH, thermal aggregation of firefly luciferase and citrate synthase, and the chemically induced inactivation of lysozyme. In the analyses shown here, ERD10 and ERD14 demonstrated marked effects on the prevention of aggregation/deactivation of protein substrates.
Cellular Chaperone Function of Intrinsically Disordered Dehydrin ERD14
Here, we explored the involvement of each conserved segment in the protective function of the intrinsically disordered stress protein (IDSP) A. thaliana’s Early Response to Dehydration (ERD14).
In phosphate buffer, all tested proteins showed a CD spectral shape characteristic of a disordered protein (Figure 4A), very similar to that of the wild-type ERD14. Because CD spectroscopy reflects the average secondary structure content, this indicates that the free ERD14 molecules are essentially disordered, and the helices shown by NMR [9] are truly only transient and might be stabilized by interacting with partner molecules.
Cellular Chaperone Function of Intrinsically Disordered Dehydrin ERD14
Here, we explored the involvement of each conserved segment in the protective function of the intrinsically disordered stress protein (IDSP) A. thaliana’s Early Response to Dehydration (ERD14). We show that segments that are directly involved in partner binding, and others that are not, are equally necessary for proper function and that cellular protection emerges from the balanced interplay of 
different regions of ERD14.
These results suggest that Kc and S are the primary sites of activity, together with varying contributions of other segments. These notions were further confirmed by the in vitro chaperone activities of these mutants (Supplementary Figure S3 and Table S4). In these experiments, the ∆Kc and ∆S variants showed similarly reduced chaperone activities as the FS ERD14 variant. This is an interesting observation, especially in light of the fact that all K-segments participate in partner binding within a cell, whereas the S-segment does not [9]. Although partner binding in itself is a property of large amounts of proteins, only a small portion of them exhibit chaperone activity. Beyond the necessary partner binding regions, a chaperone is expected to have segments that contribute to or are responsible for chaperone function, such as the S-segment.

There was no electron density observed for the N-terminal region (residues 1–11), suggesting that this region is highly flexible or adopts more than one conformation.
What the authors refer to as residues 1-11 correspond to residues 25-35 in the UniProt sequence
It should also be noted that the three-dimensional TEM analysis did not produce a structure for the N-terminal region that was disordered in the crystal structure.
The averaged most populated volume envelope from the 20 SAXS models showed that the N-terminal region projected from the central pore and was found primarily on the longitudinal side of the tetramer. The structural model indicated that the missing N-terminal region was exposed to solvent and adopted a highly mobile conformation.
However, the N-terminal region (residues 1–11) was disordered in the crystal structure, and SAXS analysis revealed that this region was exposed to solvent and highly flexible. 
What the authors refer to as residues 1-11 correspond to residues 25-35 in the UniProt sequence
The N-terminal Pro-rich region (FELPSVPFPAP), however, was apparently hydrophobic, but its structure was not discernable by x-ray crystallography, three-dimensional TEM (Fig. 1), or NMR studies (supplemental Fig. 3)
The circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of His-S–N-terminal part exhibits a negative peak at 201.5 nm (Fig. 3B), which is characteristic of a protein in largely unfolded conformation. The lack of characteristic minima around 208 and 222 nm is indicative of the absence of a -helix. There is a broad but weak negative ‘shoulder’ peak between 215 and 230 nm, implying the existence of small proportion of residual secondary structure.
The puriﬁed Trx-His-S tagged recombinant proteins, i.e. FL, N-terminal part, A, B, and AB domain showed molecular weights of 42, 34, 29, 29 and 32 kDa, respectively. These sizes are 18%, 38%, 29%, 28%, and 6% larger for FL,
N-terminal part (Fig. 2B), A, B, and AB domains, respectively (not shown). The reason for the anomalous migration of recombinant A and B domains is not clear. As depicted in Fig. 2A the His-S–N-terminal part migrated >90% higher than its theoretical molecular mass (12.8 kDa). This is probably due to the primary sequence of N-terminal part of BSP5, which includes many acidic residues and proline (Table 1). Such abnormal behavior has already been
observed in other intrinsically disordered proteins and can most
likely be ascribed to their unusual sequence and composition
In MIC-A, no electron density is observed for ten residues (152–161) in one section of these helices (corresponding to helix 2a in the α2 domain of HLA-B27) or for the polyhistidine purification tag.
The region corresponds to region 175-184 of the protein sequence.
Preliminary results from limited proteolysis with thermolysin at pH 7.5, in which MIC-A is initially cleaved in the region of this loop, suggest that this loop is exposed and flexible at near neutral pH as well (data not shown).
The region corresponds to region 175-184 of the protein sequence.
CD spectroscopy of WNV peptides (1–24) and (80–105) revealed that they are both completely unfolded (Figure 7C; deconvolution data not shown), suggesting that RNA chaperone activity of WNV core protein does not require a well-defined structure.
CD spectroscopy of WNV peptides (1–24) and (80–105) revealed that they are both completely unfolded (Figure 7C; deconvolution data not shown), suggesting that RNA chaperone activity of WNV core protein does not require a well-defined structure.
As shown in Figure 7A, WNV 1–24 exhibited only a low level of strand-annealing activity, while WNV 80–105 caused efficient DNA duplex formation.
As shown in Figure 7A, WNV 1–24 exhibited only a low level of strand-annealing activity, while WNV 80–105 caused efficient DNA duplex formation.
The RNA chaperone activity of the WNV (80–105) peptide was further confirmed with the ribozyme cleavage assay, which requires both the strand annealing and helix unwinding activities of a chaperone.
 As expected, all core proteins induced a considerable increase in the cleavage rates, with hepacivirus core proteins demonstrating a higher activity compared to WNV and BVDV cores (Figure 4C).

The PDB shows this region lacks electron density, indicating it is disordered.
FL HCV and GBV-B core proteins retained most of their chaperone activity after boiling for 5 min (∼75%, based on PhosporImager quantification, see lanes 4–6 versus 7–9 in Figure 4A and lanes 29–31 versus 32–34 in Figure 4B).
The isolated N-terminal domain of HCV core [core(2–117)], as well as the FL HCV and GBV-B core proteins are mostly unstructured in solution, showing an ellipticity minimum at ∼198 nm, characteristically of random-coil like peptides [(36) and Figure 5].
The ability of purified proteins to stably bind RNA and DNA was verified by means of mobility shift assays. All four proteins bound both to RNA and DNA without a strict sequence specificity, and they caused complete retention of the nucleic acids at the top of the gel (indicative of the formation of large nucleoprotein complexes) at a protein-to-nucleotide molar ratio of ∼1:20 (data not shown).

By means of classical in vitro RNA chaperone assays (e.g. strand annealing, strand exchange and ribozyme assays; Figures 2 and ​and3,3, and data not shown), we showed that nucleic acid chaperone activity is also conserved between the two hepacivirus core proteins, and that GBV-B core also efficiently facilitates the formation of the most stable nucleic acid structure. 
 As expected, all core proteins induced a considerable increase in the cleavage rates, with hepacivirus core proteins demonstrating a higher activity compared to WNV and BVDV cores (Figure 4C).
Natively unstructured proteins have a large proportion of solvent-exposed residues and are therefore highly susceptible to trace amounts of protease. Treatment of C87 or C90 with endoprotease GluC resulted in almost complete digestion within 1 minute when the core protein was present in a 10-fold excess (Fig. 2B). Similar results were seen with trypsin and chymotrypsin, and, for all three enzymes, proteolysis of C87 was complete within 1 hour even when core protein was in a 300-fold excess (data not shown). These results suggested that the majority of core residues are accessible to proteases.
We next used intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy to determine the environment of tyrosine residues within the core protein. The peak emission of C90 was observed at approximately 360 nm. Since an emission maximum at a wavelength greater than 340 nm indicates a high degree of solvent exposure, this again suggested that the core protein lacked significant globular structure (Fig. 2C).
The core protein was further analyzed for the presence of secondary structural elements by far-UV CD (reviewed in reference 19). The CD spectrum of C87 indicated a minimum at approximately 195 nm, consistent with a protein that lacks secondary structure ​(Fig. 2D). A minimum at 208 nm or 222 nm, indicative of α-helical or β-sheet secondary structures, was not observed.
BVDV core protein, in agreement with the disorder prediction (Figure 1), was found to be completely unstructured at 20°C, as evidenced by the pronounced minimum in the CD spectrum observed at ∼200 nm (Figure 6D).
BVDV core protein was found to completely lack a well-defined structure, as evidenced by its CD spectrum at 20°C and 95°C (Figure 6D).
All four proteins bound both to RNA and DNA without a strict sequence specificity, and they caused complete retention of the nucleic acids at the top of the gel (indicative of the formation of large nucleoprotein complexes) at a protein-to-nucleotide molar ratio of ∼1:20 (data not shown).

Surprisingly, both WNV core, a protein with a well-defined 3D structure (40), and BVDV core, which was predicted to be completely unstructured (Figure 1), retained their full activity upon boiling (compare lanes 36–38 and 39–41, and 43–45 and 46–48 in Figure 4B).
As expected, all core proteins induced a considerable increase in the cleavage rates, with hepacivirus core proteins demonstrating a higher activity compared to WNV and BVDV cores (Figure 4C). 
Despite a lack of significant similarity with hepacivirus cores in amino acid sequence or domain organization (Figure 1), core proteins of the flavivirus WNV and the pestivirus BVDV both demonstrated potent RNA chaperone activities in vitro (Figures 2 and 3).
After binding of protein and labeled RNA in solution, reaction mixtures were applied to nitrocellulose filters under vacuum and washed, and RNA retained on the filter was quantified. C87 and C90 were found to bind RNA equivalently and with approximately 1 μM affinity; a slight preference was seen for G and U homo-oligomers ​(Fig. 3 and Table 1).
At 24 h postelectroporation, cell culture supernatants were harvested, clarified by filtration, and used to infect naïve BHK 21 cells. The infected cells were incubated for 4 h before assay for luciferase activity. Sindbis/luc(CΔ2-96) was severely impaired in infectious virus production, while the less drastic deletions, Sindbis/luc(CΔ50-96) and Sindbis/luc(CΔ72-96), showed only moderate reductions (Fig. ​(Fig.8C).8C). In each case, the inclusion of BVDV sequences led to increased signal compared to the deletion mutants, suggesting that the BVDV residues positively influenced infectious virion production.
Taken together, these results suggest that the nonspecific RNA-binding properties of BVDV core observed in vitro are responsible for its ability to functionally replace a heterologous RNA condensation sequence in vivo, and they indicate that the BVDV core protein likely functions by a similar mechanism in packaging its own genomic RNA.

The CD spectra of the NKX3.1 (1–184), (75–184), (97–184), and (114–184) constructs are consistent with the homeodomain containing significant α-helical content and the N-terminal region consisting of flexible, disordered structure (Figure 1D), as already shown in previous NMR studies (6, 7).
Residues 1−13 in the NMR structure are highly disordered; the subsequent residues (14−19) adopt a different conformation as compared to the crystal structure of vMIP-II.
Since the peptide used in this publication corresponds to residues 21−94 of vMIP-II,  the region the authors are describing is 21-34.
However, the binding of vMIP-II(1–11)dimer is only 180-fold less than SDF-1 and is the most tightly binding small peptide that we have observed to date.
Two N-terminal peptides, vMIP-II(1–10) and vMIP-II(1–11)dimer (dimerised through Cys11) were synthesised. Both peptides are shown to bind the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). vMIP-II(1–10) was 1400-fold less potent than the native protein whilst the vMIP-II(1–11)dimer was only 180-fold less potent.
Since the peptide used in this publication corresponds to residues 21−94 of vMIP-II, the region the authors refered as 1-11 are the residues 21-32 of the Uniprot.
No long-range or medium-range NOEs were observed for the N-terminal residues 1–13 or the last two C-terminal residues.
The N-terminus (residues 1–13) is disordered up to the first cysteine (Cys14).
Since the peptide used in this publication corresponds to residues 21−94 of vMIP-II, the region the authors are describing as disordered is 21-34.
The structure of vMIP-II, shown in Figures 2A and 2B, consists of a disordered N-terminal region having a substantial number of sequential NOE contacts beginning at residue Trp8, but having no long-range NOE contacts until Cys14, with these due largely to the participation of both Cys14 and Cys15 in disulfide bonds (to Cys38 and Cys54, respectively)
Since the peptide used in this publication corresponds to residues 21−94 of vMIP-II, the region the authors are describing as disordered is 21-34.
In the unbound form of NiV-G, the 579-590 loop is relatively flexible in both molecules of the crystallographic asymmetric unit, and 2Fo-Fc electron density for the side chains is poor.
In addition, the 579-590 and 236-245 loops exhibit high B-factor values in the apo form (Fig. 1B and C).
In addition, the 236-245 loop is rather disordered in the unbound structure." Results "In addition, the 579-590 and 236-245 loops exhibit high B-factor values in the apo form (Fig. 1B and C).
Structural differences are particularly pronounced in the 579-590 loop, a major component of the ephrin binding surface.
Both molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit of apo-NiV-G show structural differences from the EFNB2-bound form in the region of the 579-590 loop.
The N- and C-termini are highly flexible, as observed for all other chemokines and in line with the high rmsd values in this region of the structure.
In order to assess the extent of protease sensitivity, we submitted Henipavirus PNT and NTAIL to digestion by thermolysin. As shown in Fig. 4, all the proteins are readily degraded by thermolysin after one hour incubation, a behavior that is consistent with the lack of a packed core and with an overall solvent accessibility of Henipavirus PNT and NTAIL.
This abnormal behavior is therefore likely to be ascribed to a rather high content of acidic residues, as already been observed in the case of the intrinsically disordered MeV PNT [18] and NTAIL domains [6], [19], and, more generally, in other IDPs [46].
On the other hand, no fragment corresponding to the remaining NTAIL domain was detected, indicating that it is hypersensitive to proteolysis and entirely degraded in the context of the entire N proteins either.
The results presented here show that both N proteins undergo proteolytic cleavage within their NTAIL domains, thus supporting the disordered nature of these domains not only in isolation but also in the context of the entire N proteins.
In addition, both NMR and far-UV CD studies revealed a gain of α-helicity within NTAIL upon binding to PXD, and ITC studies showed that the interaction does not rely on electrostatic contacts, as the KD was not affected by NaCl concentrations as high as 1 m
The NMR titration experiments of Henipavirus NTAIL with increasing amounts of PXD confirmed that a complex is formed between the two partners.

These observations point toward the intermediate exchange regime often observed for IDPs undergoing folding-upon-binding events (for examples see Refs. 39, 54, 83, and 118).
For all the spin labels grafted within
Box3, the number of possible rotamers built by MMM
on the structural model of the NiV NTAIL–PXD complex
(i.e. the number of possible rotamers that could be
accommodated in the available conformational space) is
comparable to that obtained with HeV (Figure 6(B)).

Hence, this anomalous electrophoretic mobility is rather due to a rather high content of acidic residues, as already observed for other intrinsically disordered domains (for examples see Ref. 6, 45, and 85) and, more generally, in other IDPs (86).
Conversely, the CD spectra of both NTAIL proteins are typical of predominantly unfolded proteins, as seen by their large negative ellipticity at 198 nm and low ellipticity at 190 nm (Fig. 5, A and B, black lines). Nevertheless, and as already reported (14), the observed ellipticity values at 200 and 222 nm of both Henipavirus NTAIL proteins are consistent with the existence of some residual secondary structure typical of IDPs adopting a PMG conformation (21).
The obtained RS values (37±2 Å for both NTAIL proteins, and either 55±2 Å or 57±2 Å for NiV and HeV PNT, respectively) highlight a significant increase in the hydrodynamic radius in the presence of urea (see Table 1). These results argue for the presence of residual intramolecular interactions within Henipavirus PNT and NTAIL proteins under native conditions, as expected for proteins adopting a PMG conformation.
The experimentally observed spectra of the mixtures support a random-coil to α-helix transition, as judged by the much more pronounced minima at 208 and 222 nm and by the higher ellipticity at 190 nm of the experimentally observed spectra compared with the corresponding theoretical average curves (see Fig. 5, A and B).
This analysis indicated a significant increase in the α-helical content of the mixtures as compared with average spectra, with this gain in α-helicity being paralleled by a decrease in the content of disordered structure (see Fig. 5, C and D).
Using the same approach, we showed that both NiV and HeV NTAIL undergo α-helical induced folding upon binding to the corresponding P X domain
The estimates for the model parameters (see Table 1) confirm a 1:1 stoichiometry and reveal that the binding reaction is both enthalpy- and entropy-driven, with the exception only of the NiV NTAIL-PXD couple for which a small unfavorable entropic contribution was found.
Similar experiments carried out in the presence of 1 m NaCl (data not shown) yielded similar results (see Table 1), suggesting that the NTAIL-PXD interaction relies mainly on hydrophobic interactions.
In the case of the study of the NiV NTAIL-PXD complex, upon addition of stoichiometric amounts of PXD, the NTAIL peak shifted toward a lower elution volume (from 8.1 to 7.75 ml), indicating the formation of an NTAIL-PXD complex, as also judged from the estimated mass (25,610 ± 80 Da), a value consistent with the binding of one PXD molecule/NTAIL (expected mass ∼ 22 kDa) (data not shown).
The binding reaction conformed to a 1:1 ligand-substrate (Langmuir) binding model, exhibiting an excellent fit (i.e. χ2 < 1 and residuals within the range of ±2) following global kinetic analysis of sensorgrams as well as when plotting mean equilibrium responses of the data in the steady state analysis.
Interestingly, in the case of the NiV NTAIL titration, but not of the HeV one, among the correlation peaks that were displaced by PXD, eight underwent an upfield shift (see Fig. 6A) consistent with a random coil to α-helix transition.
These studies suggest that Henipavirus PNT and NTAIL proteins either adopt a PMG conformation or are folded trimers.
The very small spread of the resonance frequencies for amide protons (between 7.8 ppm and 8.7 ppm, see frames in Fig. 6) together with the scarcity of NOEs in the amide-amide region are typical of proteins without any stable secondary structure (for examples see [6], [18]), thereby supporting lack of a packed core within Henipavirus PNT and NTAIL domains.
In further support of the absence of an ordered structure, the far-UV CD spectra of Henipavirus PNT and NTAIL at neutral pH are typical of unstructured proteins, as seen from their large negative ellipticity at 198 nm and low ellipticity at 190 nm (Fig. 7A). However, the observed ellipticity values at 200 and 222 nm of Henipavirus NTAIL and of NiV PNT are consistent with the existence of some residual secondary structure, as observed in IDPs adopting a PMG conformation (Fig. 7B).
This anomalous electrophoretic mobility is
frequently observed in IDPs and is to be ascribed to a
relatively high content in acidic residues (Tompa, 2002),
and/or to a high degree of protein extension in solution
(Blocquel et al., 2012).
The Stokes radius value of the monomeric form of
all Henipavirus NTAIL variants (28 ± 2 Å), as inferred
from the apparent molecular mass observed in SEC, is
the same as that observed for both parental HeV and
NiV NTAIL proteins (data not shown). This value is consistent
with the value expected for IDPs adopting a premolten
globule state (Uversky, 2002b).
The far-UV CD spectra of spin-labeled NTAIL proteins variants at neutral pH quite well superimpose onto that of parental NTAIL, andare all typical of unstructured proteins, as shown by their large negative ellipticity at 200 nm and moderate ellipticity at 190 nm (Figures 2(A), (B) and S2).
Indeed, the observed CD spectra of the mixtures differed from the corresponding theoretical average curves calculated from the individual NTAIL and PXD spectra (Fig. 5).
In addition, both NMR and far-UV CD studies revealed a gain of α-helicity within NTAIL upon binding to PXD, and ITC studies showed that the interaction does not rely on electrostatic contacts, as the KD was not affected by NaCl concentrations as high as 1 m.

Taken together, the EPR analyses of the labeled variants within Box3 bring experimental support for the structural model of HeV NTAIL–PXD complex that we previously proposed (Habchi et al., 2011) (Figure 6(A)).

NiV PNT is a very large intrinsically disordered protein (412 residues including the C-terminal His tag and the initial methionine), as can be inferred by inspection of the two 2D spectra, the 1H–15N HSQC (Fig. 2A) and the 13C′–15N CON (Fig. 2B).
The relaxation rates show an overall trend consistent with the considerably disordered conformation of PNT.
The NMR data clearly suggest that NiV PNT is disordered and very flexible with few short and transient secondary structure elements.
The experimentally determined Rg is therefore very close to the value expected for an IDP (for comparison the Rg expected for a random coil conformation would be ~ 7253).
The flexible nature of NiV PNT was qualitatively assessed by using the normalized Kratky plot, where the absence of a well-defined bell shape indicates a protein with intrinsically disordered regions (Fig. 4C).
In addition, the poor chemical-shift dispersion of amide resonances in the HSQC NMR spectrum was typical of disordered protein, but after assigning the NMR spectrum, the secondary-structure propensity (SSP) parameter calculated from Cα and Cβ secondary chemical shifts indicated the presence of five fluctuating α-helices (Supplementary Fig. 2c).
The poor chemical shift dispersion of amide 1H resonances in the heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 1d) is typical of disordered proteins. 
By SEC-MALLS, we showed that the peptide is monomeric in solution and that both its hydrodynamic radius measured by SEC and its radius of gyration measured by SAXS were larger than expected for a globular protein of this molecular mass (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b).
The hydrodynamic radius of 2.6 ± 0.5 nm measured by SEC (a) and the radius of gyration of 3.1 ± 0.5 nm measured by SAXS (b) are larger than expected for a compact domain of this size.

The N-terminal chaperone region of P is stabilized upon binding to its N0 partner, but only the first 35 residues of P, corresponding to the first fluctuating helix observed in solution (helix αP1), were visible in the crystal structure of N32–3830–P50.

By size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) combined with multiangle laser light scattering (MALLS) (Fig. 1b) and by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we found that these reconstituted N0–P core complexes are compact heterodimers with an overall bean-like shape typical of other NNV N proteins18.
(c) The heterodimeric N32-3830-P50 complex has a bean shape in solution. The ab initio bead model generated from SAXS data (in grey) accommodates a single N32-3830-P50 copy from the crystal.
We then analyzed the HSQC spectrum of P100 bound to N32–402. In a complex of this size (~50 kDa), NMR signals are strongly broadened in protonated samples, thus precluding their detection, but in the HSQC spectrum we observed resonances corresponding to residues 50 to 100, thus indicating that this region remains flexible in the complex and that the N0-binding region is comprised within the first 50 N-terminal amino acids of P (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1d).

Henipavirus PNT and NTAIL were found to be highly sensitive to proteolysis, a property that constitutes a hallmark of structural disorder (see [47] and references therein cited).
 The CD spectrum of a freshly purified sample of PNT3 was typical of an IDP, as illustrated by the very pronounced negative peak at 200 nm and low ellipticity in the 190–200 nm region (Figure 5).
Henipavirus phosphoprotein PNT3 region is comprised within the residues 200-310.
Negative staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM) unequivocally confirmed the presence of amyloid-like fibrils (Figure 4D).
At 2 mg mL−1 (132 μM), the calculated radii of gyration (Rg) obtained after 1 h (Rg = 3.34 ± 0.1 nm) and 1.5 h (Rg = 3.01 ± 0.08 nm) of incubation are consistent with the value expected for a monomeric form of PNT3 in a disordered state according to Flory’s equation (Rg = 3.26 ± 0.03 nm) [58].
The distribution of the maximum particle sizes (Dmax) of the selected ensemble ranges from ~50 to 200 Å, centered on ~100 Å (Figure S3D). The selected ensemble exhibits a high flexibility (Rflex = 88.4 %), a value similar to that of the initial pool (87.2%, Rσ = 1.04) and consistent with pure random-coil conformations.
Henipavirus phosphoprotein PNT3 region is comprised within the residues 200-310.
After 2 h of incubation, higher order oligomers/aggregates dominated, as judged from the intensity increase in the low-angle region of the scattering curves (Figure 6A) and from the shape of the total scattered intensities plots (Figure 6B).
In conclusion, SAXS experiments show that PNT3 was monomeric and disordered in the solution, adopting a typical Gaussian chain distribution of its parameters. However, it rapidly aggregates in a concentration-dependent manner to form rod-like particles, a behavior compatible with the formation of fibrillar species.
Henipavirus phosphoprotein PNT3 region is comprised within the residues 200-310.
CR-staining experiments showed that cells transfected to express PNT3 capture CR more than cells transfected with an empty vector (Figure 11), providing clues about the formation of PNT3 fibrils also in a cellular context. 
Henipavirus phosphoprotein PNT3 region is comprised within the residues 200-310.
These experiments, beyond shedding light onto the nature of the PNT3 condensates, also confirmed the ability of PNT3 to phase separate in the absence of crowding agents and revealed that the process takes place even in the sub-micromolar concentration range, although a prolonged incubation period at 37 °C was required.
PNT3 was shown to phase-separate in vitro into solid-like condensates, as shown by FRAP.
Henipavirus phosphoprotein PNT3 region is comprised within the residues 200-310.
Size-exclusion chromatography was employed to estimate the Rh values of the three sets of model IDPs (Table 2). Experimental Rh values of wt NTAIL and wt PNT4 (2.71 ± 0.09 and 2.34 ± 0.11 nm, respectively) are close to the theoretical ones (Table 1) and similar to the previously determined ones [9].
Experimentally determined Rh matches the theoretical Rh for IDPs [Marsh & Forman-Kay, 2010].
Rt (nm) = 2.54
Native MS was employed to assess the conformational properties of the three sets of IDPs. In this approach, the CSDs resulting from the nanoESI process reflect the overall compactness and relative amounts of the main conformers in the original solution [17,18,22]. Native-MS spectra obtained under non-denaturing conditions for the three variants of NTAIL (Figure 4a), NFM, and PNT4 (Figure S3) display multimodal CSDs, highlighting the heterogeneous conformational ensemble typical of IDPs.

Typical random coil-like far-UV CD spectrum is displayed for PNT4.
The very narrow peak dispersion in the 1H dimension of the 1H–15N HSQC spectrum shows that YAP 50–171 is intrinsically disordered.
The apparent molecular mass of Hsp12 deduced from the gel was an overestimated value of 14 kDa (Fig. 2A). Hsp12 was also reported earlier to have an apparent mobility corresponding to a protein of 14.4 kDa [3]. IDPs are known to be unusually mobile on SDS-PAGE.
For Hsp12, a large negative peak around 200 nm was found in aqueous solution (Fig. 4A). This curve was specific to the random coil structure corresponding to an unstructured protein in solution.
To characterize the interaction between Hsp12 and phospholipids, ITC and DSC were performed (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). The negative peaks which appeared with each addition of protein showed an exothermic reaction and therefore an interaction between Hsp12 and liposomes (Fig. 5A)
Thanks to DSC, temperature phase transition was measured at 38 °C with a peak area of 1441 μV/s for the liposome alone (Fig. 6). With Hsp12, a shift of +1 °C was observed indicating that the physicochemical properties of the phospholipid vesicle were changed. An increase in Tm is indicative of membrane rigidification. Moreover, with Hsp12, the peak area was lower (920 μV/s) indicating a change in enthalpy. This reflected a modification in the fatty acid chains, probably due to a partial insertion of Hsp12 in the hydrocarbon moiety. Hsp12 might therefore play a role in the stress‐induced remodeling of membrane lipids.
NMR analysis indicated that Hsp12 is monomeric and intrinsically unfolded in solution, but switches to a 4-helical conformation upon binding to membrane-mimetic SDS micelles. The structure of micelle-bound Hsp12 reported here is consistent with its recently proposed function as a membrane-stabilising 'lipid chaperone'. Taken together, our data suggest that DR-induced Hsp12 expression contributes to lifespan extension, possibly via membrane alterations
The 15N-1H HSQC spectrum showed poor resonance dispersion in the proton dimension, which suggested that Hsp12 is intrinsically disordered in aqueous buffer (Fig. 3A).
The 15N-1H HSQC spectra of Hsp12 showed a dose-dependent increase in dispersion in response to SDS, indicating that Hsp12 adopts a folded conformation upon micelle binding (Fig. 3B).
Consistent with this, analysis of the assigned chemical shifts in Hsp12 using CSI [25] suggested that micelle binding induces the formation of four α-helices (Fig. 4G). These α-helices cover the majority of the polypeptide and comprise residues F9-A16 (Helix I), Q22-A41 (Helix II), V52-G63 (Helix III) and L74-E94 (Helix IV).
Soluble GST-GS was mainly helical, and freeGS was unstructured in solution as determined by CD measurements (Fig. 8E, F).
In the presence of increasing concentrations of GST-GS, ThT exhibited a dose-dependent enhanced fluorescence emission at 482 nm, consistent with an amyloid-like nature of the fibrillar assemblies (Fig. 7A).
Moreover, fibrillar GST-GS binds CR, as shown by the spectral red shift observed in the CR absorption peak, and CR-stained GST-GS aggregates exhibited green yellow birefringence under polarized light, features considered characteristic of amyloid structures (Supplemental Fig. 1 A, B).
The recorded FTIR spectrum of fibrillar GST-GS obtained after incubation of the polypeptide at 4°C for 30 d (Fig. 8A) was centered at 1637 cm−1 (Fig. 8D).
In contrast, DAXX161-243 and DAXX347-420 appeared partially aggregated or mostly unfolded, respectively.
We assigned the NMR resonances of 15N,13C cDAXX (Figures S3A and S3B), which have the limited chemical shift dispersion and sharp line widths of a typical intrinsically disordered region (IDR) (Figure 3A
These spectral properties indicate that many cDAXX conformations are in fast exchange and that the IDR exhibits little structure.
A titration of unlabeled SPOPMATH into 15N,13C cDAXX and monitored by CON spectra resulted in a dose-dependent loss of signal intensity along several cDAXX regions
SPOP and DAXX localize to SPOP/DAXX bodies.
SPOP and DAXX form nuclear bodies with liquid properties.
DAXX and SPOP therefore both re-localized from their original subcellular location when expressed together. The SPOP/DAXX bodies possess liquid properties as evidenced by their ability to undergo fusion events within minutes (Fig. 1C, D, Supplemental Videos S1, S2). These properties place them into the category of liquid membraneless organelles.
 It is clear from these observations that SPOP and DAXX not only bind to each other, but binding shifts them to a different liquid organelle.
This observation suggests that weak multivalent interactions between SPOP and DAXX result in a sol-gel transition coupled to phase separation, as defined by Harmon et al (Harmon et al., 2017).
The C-terminal fragment mDAXX566-739 had random coil 1HN shifts, indicating that indeed, as predicted, it is predominantly disordered.
In contrast, DAXX161-243 and DAXX347-420 appeared partially aggregated or mostly unfolded, respectively.

The HDX data clearly show that the first 27 residues are disordered with corresponding fast HDX, whereas significantly slower HDX is observed in the following jmjN and ARID domain regions.
The following region (residues 198–375) is characterized by fast HDX and two regions that lack HDX data. However, the PHD1 domain region is characterized by slow HDX, demonstrating the presence of higher-order structure.
The following region (residues 198–375) is characterized by fast HDX and two regions that lack HDX data. However, the PHD1 domain region is characterized by slow HDX, demonstrating the presence of higher-order structure.
In the jmjC domain, the segment containing res. 430–453 to seen to display very fast HDX. This agrees well with the KDM5B 1–753 crystal structure19, where the region 442–447 lacked electron density and was omitted from the model. 
Residues 441-444 are missing in the crystal structure and nearby residues have a high relative B-factor values. This agrees with the fast HDX seen for residues 430-453 (pmid:30858420).
The region 469–481 also shows fast HDX. As seen in the crystal structure, in particular the region around H474 is suggested to be disordered.
The fast exchange of the region 543–554 also agrees with the poorly defined electron density around residue 545 in the crystal structure.
In contrast, the surface exposed loop region (peptide 563–574) of ccKDM5B exchange quickly with a dynamic conformation in solution but has a very well defined electron density in the crystal structures.
A weak coil-coil signature is also observed approximately 100 amino acids downstream of these 3 motifs, at residues 1056–1072. After this the region 1078–1125 displays fast HDX.
Another predicted helical region 1228–1270, supported by the HDX data, is located immediately after the PHD2 domain, again followed by a long unstructured region 1271–1344 with fast HDX.
This region is followed by another predicted helical region 1345–1365 with reduced HDX that in turn is followed by a region 1376–1450 with sparse HDX sequence coverage. Data for the only peptide from this region shows fast HDX demonstrating a disordered structure despite a predicted helicity.
We here report the NMR 1H, 15N, 13CO, 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shift assignment of the C-terminal region that is specific to prelamin A, from amino acid 567 to amino acid 664. We also report the NMR 1H, 15N, 13CO, 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shift assignment of the C-terminal region of the progerin variant, from amino acid 567 to amino acid 614. Analysis of these chemical shift data confirms that both prelamin A and progerin C-terminal domains are largely disordered and identifies a common partially populated α-helix from amino acid 576 to amino acid 585.
The N-terminal part of the constructs, i.e. residues 44–85, which are just C-terminal of the predicted transmembrane region comprising residues 24–43, are disordered in the present structure. 
This helix is followed by a variable loop disordered in TyrRSapm as well as in the M. jannaschii apo TyrRS structure 1U7D
The dimer interface should then appear more flexible than the rest of the molecule, leading to higher B-factor values. This region of the TyrRSapm structure is actually more agitated than its surroundings.
Forcing the TyrRSapm dimer into the standard conformation would cost 1,000 Å2 of the buried surface area and greatly reduce its stability. Conversely, forcing the other (canonical) TyrRS dimer into the conformation observed for the TyrRSapm dimer would also be energetically unfavorable, again at a cost of about 1,000 Å2.
some 37% was crystallographically disordered (missing residues 16-41, 62-84, 110-120, 139-156, 1860190, 223-224). The presence within this disordered region of all the previously identified sites of proteolytic cleavage is evidence that the disorder represents the changes occurring in vivo.

The final model is complete, except for residues 234-244 and the 10 C-terminal residues in both molecules because of weak electron density, indicating that the region may be disordered.
In the mutant (b), the active site is partly covered by the loop 234-244 (top left of the figure), which is missing in the wild type.

Residues 2−4 at the N-terminus and 56−66 at the C-terminus of λ-WDQ showed significant NOE reductions and increases in T2, suggestive of increased mobility, in approximate agreement with the location of poorly defined regions in the ensemble.
Moreover, it was found that the amide resonances disappeared immediately after the freshly prepared protein was dissolved in D2O solution (Fig. 2D). This indicated that the amide protons are accessible to the solvent and the protein has no well-defined hydrogen bonds.
The cross-correlation NH(i) − NH(i + 1) resonance peaks from homonuclear 2D-NOE are essentially absent (supplementary Fig. S1) indicating little overall solution structure for NT-proANP, a result also found for NT-proBNP (11).
Figure 2B shows the 4°C proton spectra for NT-proANP in 10% D2O. The intensity in the amide region is rather low and confined to a narrow region of ~8–8.6 ppm.
As myoglobin is known to adopt a compact, folded three-dimensional structure (25), and as the above far-UV CD and NMR data demonstrate that NT-proANP is largely unstructured in physiologic near neutral pH non-denaturing buffer, it is evident that shape, e.g. Rs the Stoke's radius, and not molecular weight is the determining mechanistic factor in SE-HPLC. On the same column, unstructured monomeric NT-proBNP eluted at 20.6′ (data not shown).
Figure 1 displays a room temperature CD spectrum for NT-proANP in a physiologic near neutral pH buffer. A minimum is observed at ~199–200 nm giving a value of –14,800° cm2/dmol indicating that the 68-residue NT-proANP fragment is largely unstructured.
The ISC makes contacts with SH2, nSH3 and cSH3. In fact, we identified 54 distance restraints from the ISC to SH2, nSH3 and cSH3, but the other region in the nSH3-cSH3 linker, aside from the ISC, is flexible.

We recorded the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the CRKII mutant containing a W275K mutation. Most of the NMR signals from the ISC as well as from cSH3 in CRKII disappeared for this mutant, and new signals appeared in the disordered region (Supplementary Fig. 4 online). This means that the tertiary structure of cSH3 was disrupted by the W275K mutation, abrogating the interaction between the ISC and cSH3.

Although the complete recombinant PvAMA1 ectoplasmic region (residues 43–487) and domains II and III of PfAMA1 (residues 303 to 544) were complexed with Fab F8.12.19 in the protein preparations used for crystallisation, only a small but contiguous segment of domain III from these two homologues could be identified in the electron density: the 34-residue segment from Ile421 to Lys454 in PvAMA1 and the equivalent 34-residue segment from Ile479 to Arg512 in PfAMA1 (Figure 4). This part of the antigen could be identified readily in the electron density by the cystine knot formed with Cys432-Cys449 and Cys434-Cys451 in PvAMA1 and Cys490-Cys507 and Cys492-Cys509 in PfAMA1. Additional electron density, observed in the final difference maps of both PvAMA1 and PfAMA1, did not coincide with the complete, superimposed PvAMA1 structure (PDB entry 1W8K) (Figure 5). This region is connected to modelled part of the antigen via the Cys388-Cys444 bridge in PvAMA1 (443Cys-502Cys in PfAMA1) but the electron density was too disordered to propose an unambiguous interpretation. No other region of significant electron density occurred in the maps.
The region defined here is based on the missing residues in the PDB structure 2j4w. Based on the same structure, there is likely disordered regions in the N-terminal part as well, however, a close homologue from P. falciparum indicates that the N-terminal region contains a folded domain (see PDB structure 4r1a).
Our structural analyses reveal that G39P has a completely unexpected bipartite structure comprising a folded N-terminal domain and an essentially unfolded C-terminal domain.
Our findings strongly support the idea that the disorder observed in the crystal structure for the C-terminal region was not a result of the truncation of the protein nor was it merely some form of crystal artifact but reflected an underlying flexibility that may be closely related to the function of the protein.
Our structural analysis has shown that the G39P protein has two domains: a stably folded 67-residue N-terminal domain and a highly flexible and largely unfolded 59-residue C-terminal domain.
High relative average B-factor values (38.3 Å2 for chain A/ 38.5 Å2 for chain B/ 38.4 Å2 for chain C) supporting the presence of intrinsic disorder in the C-terminal region of the protein.
For the C-terminal ~50 residues, i.e. about half the size of G39P, NMR relaxation rates are slow and are thus dominated by internal mobility far in excess of the overall rotation of the protein. Resonances from these residues show little chemical shift dispersion away from their random coil values, indicative of conformational averag- ing, and high intensity cross-peaks in TOCSY spectra, as illustrated by the correlations between the aromatic ring protons of Phe-76 and Tyr-80 in Fig. 3B.
Backbone amide proton resonances from the mobile C-terminal domain, upon heating the sample, are severely attenuated in intensity by solvent exchange, following saturation of the water resonance (Fig. 3A). This demonstrates that there is weak or no hydrogen bonding involving this part of the protein backbone other than to solvent molecules.
The NMR experiments indicate that in solution the protein behaves as a two-domain entity. One domain, corresponding to approximately the 67 N-terminal residues observed in the electron density map from the x-ray experiment, exists in the fold determined above, although at room temperature it is involved in a thermally labile, self-association process. The second domain, corresponding to the remaining 60 C-terminal residues that are not observed in the electron density map, has rapid internal motion and no well defined and stable fold involving immobilized side chains.
The observation of a species approximating to the size of a dimer might actually arise from the rapid interchange between the monomeric and aggregated forms of the protein and is further complicated by an increase in the hydrodynamic radius arising from the flexible C-terminal domain.
An investigation of the general susceptibility of G39P to proteolytic degradation was performed using proteinase K and both wtG39P and an N- terminal His-tagged variant. The analysis revealed a much more pronounced sensitivity to proteolytic cleavage in the C- terminal half of the protein that resulted in fragments corre- sponding to residues 1–79, 1– 87, 1–90, 1–94, and 1–106 (Fig. 6). The identity of the fragments was confirmed by the corre- spondence of the molecular weights determined by mass spec- trometry and by retention on a Ni-NTA column of equivalent fragments (as assessed by SDS-PAGE) from the N-terminal His-tagged variant.

A series of G39P truncated variants with N termini deleted up to residue 73 still show interaction with G40P-ATP as assessed by affinity chromatography assay, but a variant consisting of the N-terminal residues 1– 68 does not (Fig. 7).

The G39P protein is proteolytically sensitive, and our binding assays show that the C-terminal domain is essential for helicase interaction and that removal of just the 14 C-terminal residues abolishes interaction with the helicase in vitro. We propose a number of possible scenarios in which the flexibility of the C-terminal domain of G39P and its proteolytic sensitivity may have important roles for the function of G39P in vivo that are consistent with other data on SPP1 phage DNA replication.
We have observed that removal of just the C-terminal 14 residues impairs G40P binding.
The full-length wt G39P protein is able to interact with G40P-ATPγS and to inhibit all three associated activities (ssDNA binding, ATPase, and helicase activity (6)). Assays have been performed on fragments of G39P and have shown that the G39P112 variant can neither exert a negative effect on G40P activities nor compete out the wt protein from the G39P-G40P-ATP complex (data not shown).

The final model of the ezrin FERM domain contains two molecules in the asymmetric unit (molecule A — residues 2–296 and molecule B — residues 2–137, 145–146, 150–296), with Cα root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.39 Å.

The NMR structures of the recombinant 217-residue polypeptide chain of the mature bovine prion protein, bPrP(23-230), and a C-terminal fragment, bPrP(121-230), include a globular domain extending from residue 125 to residue 227, a short flexible chain end of residues 228-230, and an N-terminal flexibly disordered "tail" comprising 108 residues for the intact protein and 4 residues for bPrP(121-230), respectively.
The NMR structure of the recombinant bPrP(23–230) (Fig. ​(Fig.11a) contains a globular domain that extends approximately from residue 122 to residue 227, where the residues 128–131 form the β-strand 1, 144–154 the α-helix 1 (which has 310-type structure from residue 153 onward), 161–164 the β-strand 2, 173–194 the α-helix 2, and 200–226 the α-helix 3. At both ends of the globular domain there are flexibly disordered polypeptide segments, as evidenced by near-random coil 1H chemical shifts (29) and negative values of the steady-state 15N{1H}-NOEs (Fig. ​2). The N-terminal tail comprising residues 23–121 (because of insertions relative to hPrP this segment includes 108 residues; see ref. 23 for the numeration used) shows exclusively negative NOEs, and because of signal overlap only one set of values was obtained for all six octapeptide segments (23), as indicated by the box in Fig. ​2. The positive NOEs for residues 122–227 are typical for a globular protein of this size (see also below), whereas increased flexibility is again indicated for the C-terminal tripeptide segment (Fig. 2).
The NMR structure of the recombinant bPrP(23–230) ​(Fig.1) contains a globular domain that extends approximately from residue 122 to residue 227, where the residues 128–131 form the β-strand 1, 144–154 the α-helix 1 (which has 310-type structure from residue 153 onward), 161–164 the β-strand 2, 173–194 the α-helix 2, and 200–226 the α-helix 3. At both ends of the globular domain there are flexibly disordered polypeptide segments, as evidenced by near-random coil 1H chemical shifts (29) and negative values of the steady-state 15N{1H}-NOEs (Fig.2).

While the N-terminal segment of telethonin in the current complex displays a virtually identical structure when being compared to the previously reported titin/telethonin (1–90) complex (RMSD, 0.826 Å), its C-terminus remained invisible, leading to the assumption that it is unstructured under the conditions used for crystallization.
From this comparison, we conclude that the C-terminus of telethonin indeed is unstructured in solution, in agreement with the observations in the crystal structure.
Data derived from the crystal structure, the SAXS experiments as well as the in vivo experiments indicate that the presence of the telethonin C-terminus is required to trigger the formation of a dimeric assembly of titin/telethonin complexes.

One copy of protein VI is found intimately associated with the base of each PPH on the capsid interior. We were able to resolve residues 6–31, 34–79, and 87–157 of protein VI, which interact primarily with the bases of PPHs; the remaining C-terminal residues (158–239) were disordered.
 A segment of N-terminal pro-peptide of VI is found in the interior cavities of peripentonal hexons, and the rest of VI is disordered.
From Table 2, 1–24 corresponds to the ordered region of VI and 25–250 corresponds to the disordered region of VI.
The protein VI density we modeled is only a small fraction of the full-length mature protein VI (aa 109 to 143 versus aa 34 to 239 as numbered in pVI), suggesting that both its N- and C-terminal regions are flexible. 
The PDB show this bondaries disordered (240-250)
We used the data from this experiment to calculate ID50 values for each virus and found that the G48C mutant required ∼3-fold higher p/c than wild type AdV to achieve the same level of infection. The decrease in infectivity for the G48C mutant was not as drastic as that of the AdV VI-L40Q virus, which was 12-fold reduced compared to wild type virus. Nonetheless, the phenotype of the G48C mutation is distinct from that of L40Q, as described below.
We further assayed infectivity of the G48C mutant in an AdV plaque assay that measures viral replication, and show that the mutant generated ∼3-fold less plaques than wild type AdV at 0.5 p/c (Fig. 2B), in good agreement with the data from the single-round infection (Fig. 2A). The L40Q virus was also reduced ∼13-fold in this assay. Taken together, the results of these assays clearly indicate that the AdV VI-G48C mutant impairs virus infectivity.
Given the inherent decrease in membrane lytic activity of the disulfide bonded protein VI molecules, we next asked whether reduction of the disulfide bonds could restore membrane lytic activity to the G48C protein.
This small increase in membrane lytic activity was consistently observed in three independent experiments. Therefore, we conclude that disulfide bond formation not only restricts release of the membrane lytic protein from the viral capsid, but also impairs proper interaction with the host membrane that allows subsequent membrane lytic activity.
To identify possible trafficking determinants, we analyzed the sequences of protein VI from several Ad serotypes and identified a highly conserved ubiquitin-ligase interacting motif present in PPxY-type viral late domains (PPxY, Figure S2). To examine the role of this PPxY motif in Ad cell entry, we used an E1/E3-deleted Ad5 that had the protein VI PPSY motif mutated to PGAA (Ad5-VI-M1, detailed in Figure S3) [33],[34].
Plaques were significantly smaller for Ad5-VI-M1 versus Ad5-VI-wt (see below), suggesting that the altered PPxY domain affects some stages of virus propagation.
To identify possible trafficking determinants, we analyzed the sequences of protein VI from several Ad serotypes and identified a highly conserved ubiquitin-ligase interacting motif present in PPxY-type viral late domains (PPxY, Figure S2). To examine the role of this PPxY motif in Ad cell entry, we used an E1/E3-deleted Ad5 that had the protein VI PPSY motif mutated to PGAA (Ad5-VI-M1, detailed in Figure S3) [33],[34].
To determine whether the M1 mutation influences Ad cell entry, we performed a fluorescent focus forming assay and stained cells at 8, 12 and 24 h post-infection for expression of the E2A protein, which marks the appearance of viral replication centers (Figure 2D and data not shown). Compared to Ad5-VI-wt, the Ad5-VI-M1 virus produced approximately 20-fold fewer fluorescent foci when equivalent numbers of viral particles were used for infections. This suggested that steps prior to replication (i.e. internalization) require an intact PPxY motif in protein VI.

We repeated plaque forming assays (Figure 2E) and single round infection assays (Figure 2F), this time using GFP expression as the quantification method in non-complementing U2OS cells. We observed a reduction in infectivity in the same order of magnitude as previously (compare Figures 2C with 2E and 2D with 2F). In addition the GFP expression allowed us to follow the plaque formation over time. As shown in Figure S4 the spread of the M1 mutant virus was significantly slower and led to fewer and much smaller plaques (Figure 2E and Figure S4).

Together these data suggested that protein VI is a highly mobile protein that moves along microtubules, presumably in association with vesicular structures whose motion depends on the PPxY motif.
To address the role of the PPxY motif in protein VI ubiquitylation, we repeated the in vitro ubiquitylation assay using wt or M1 mutant protein VI purified from E. coli followed by western blot analysis. We detected protein VI-reactive bands, consistent with protein VI modified with two to three ubiquitin (Figure 6B, lane 2). In contrast, no modification was observed when the PPxY motif was mutated (Figure 6B, lane 1) or in the absence of ATP (Figure 6B, lane 3 and 4).
Two ligases, Nedd4.1 and Nedd4.2, were highly enriched on VI-wt beads while none of the other ligases showed strong binding to VI-wt- or to VI-M1-beads (Figure 7B). Taken together, these data suggest a preferential interaction between Nedd4.1 and Nedd4.2 and the PPxY motif in protein VI, which leads to relocalization of the ligases from the cytoplasm to a membrane compartment.
Measurements of the excess scattered intensity of protein solutions at finite concentrations yield apparent molar masses, Mapp. The molar mass can be estimated by a linear extrapolation to 0 protein concentration according to 1/Mapp=1/m + 2bC, where B is the second virial coefficient. The corresponding data for ProTα in PBS, pH 7.4, are shown in Figure 2. A linear least-squares fit yields M = (11700 ± 1200)g/mol and a second virial coefficient B=(2.84 ± 0.30)x10-3mol cm3/ g2. 
Prothymosin alpha: a biologically active protein with random coil conformation
Our results unequivocally demonstrate that prothymosin is a monomer under physiological conditions. The protein adopts a random coillike conformation but exhibits persistence of direction and curvature. No regular secondary structure is detectable by CD.
The CD spectrum of ProTα in PBS, pH7.4, is shown in Figure 1. It has a pattern typical of a protein lacking regular secondary structure as it is observed usually in solutions containing high concentrations of guanidinium chloride or urea.
Furthermore, the scattering curve is shown in the form of a Kratky plot (Figure 5). This scattering curve exhibits the characteristics typical of random coil molecules with persistence of direction and persistence of curvature (Kirste & Oberthiir,1982).
Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry investigations yielded a single peak with an average molar mass of 11982.8 g/mol.

In contrast, the N terminus (1–29) and C terminus (71–99) exhibit very low heteronuclear NOE values, consistent with these being disordered.

Although the construct used for crystallization encodes full-length Z, only residues 26 to 73 are ordered in monomer A and residues 26 to 75 are ordered in monomer B.
Indeed, residues 1 to 25 and 76 to 99 are disordered in the crystal structure and in solution studies by NMR.

Electron density maps were readily interpretable for mature anophelin residues AE32 to AP61 (Fig. 3A), but no significant
density was detectable for the remaining N-terminal residues AA1 to AD31.
...the inhibitor adopts a mostly extended conformation and binds to the proteinase in a reverse orientation (i.e., opposite to substrates) (Fig. S4).

In line with their lack of cysteines and the preponderance of polar residues, anophelins are predicted to be intrinsically disordered in solution (Fig. S1A). Indeed, the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of anophelinAa is typical of random coils, and its deconvolution with different methods suggests a mostly disordered polypeptide (Fig. S1B).

This N-terminal segment was similarly disordered in a second crystal form of the anophelin·thrombin complex solved at 3.2-Å resolution (space group H32; rmsd of 0.25 Å for 263 aligned Cα atoms) (Table 4) and also in this case, not constrained by crystal packing.

Residues 23 to 55 are missing in PDB entry 4E06, being therefore disordered.
15N longitudinal (T1 ) and transverse (T2 ) relaxation measurements and heteronuclear NOEs showed that ParD is divided into two separate domains, a well-ordered N-terminal domain and a very flexible C-terminal domain. An increase in secondary structure was observed upon addition of trifluoroethanol, suggested to result from the formation of structured stretches in the C-terminal part of the protein
Consensus chemical shifts and NOE data (Figures 3B and 3C) indicate that the C-terminal region is less well ordered or undergoing rapid conformational change on the NMR timescale. However, "13Cα chemical shifts show a tendency for the formation of further αhelices beyond the well-ordered N-terminal domain.[...] The negative NOE values for the C-terminal domain (Asp59–Ala83) indicate the presence of significant flexibility in this region. This is in excellent agreement with the "15N-T1 and 15N-T2 relaxation times, which clearly show two structurally different moieties ranging from Leu4 to Ile57 for the well-structured N-terminus and from Asp59–Ala83 for the remaining flexible C-terminal region.[,,,] Cα chemical-shift data show a down-field shift from the random-coil values for residues in the C-terminus for residues 58–64, 66, 68–72, 74–81 and 83, indicating a tendency for the formation of helical structures. The deviations are, however, smaller than in the N-terminal region, which again supports the presence of a predominantly unstructured C-terminal domain.

The deviations are, however, smaller than in the N-terminal region, which again supports the presence of a predominantly unstructured C-terminal domain.

As can be seen from the combined chemical shift changes (Figure 7), addition of TFE influenced mainly the residues starting from Gly38), resulting in major chemical-shift differences. This indicates a transition from the more flexible and random-coil C-terminal moiety to an α-helical domain consistent with the CD experiment

The structural changes of ParD, which are induced by TFE addition as observed in the near-UV CD spectrum, indicate the formation of additional helical structure. As monitored by NMR spectroscopy, C-terminal residues appear to be involved mainly in these changes. 


TFE was added to a ParD solution and changes in the secondary structure were monitored by CD spectroscopy. Upon an increase in the TFE concentration (from 0 to 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80%) the α-helical content rose gradually (from 37 to 44, 50, 53, 55, 62, 65, 68, 70 and 72%) with an isodichroic point at 200.4 nm (Figure 6).

Experimental 13Cα chemical-shift data, however, only indicate a propensity for α-helical regions in the C-terminus. We tried to induce this ‘missing’ helicity by the addition of TFE […] The structural changes of ParD, which are induced by TFE addition as observed in the near-UV CD spectrum, indicate the formation of additional helical structure
Near-UV CD is wrongly written by the authors, the spectrum shown in Figure 6 is a Far-UV CD spectrum
The mutations changed codons corresponding to Q51 and S53 of kis into the Ochre stop codon UAA. As this stop codon is not suppressed in the CSH16 (supE) background, the mutations should remove 35 and 33 residues, respectively, from the carboxyl terminus of the protein [...] Compared to the missense mutants, the nonsense mutants lose the antitoxin activity of the protein (Fig. 2). This suggests either that the deletions affect the region of Kis needed to inactivate Kid and to form with this protein an efficient repressor, or that these mutations severely affect the overall three-dimensional fold of Kis. However, since circular dichroism spectroscopy indicates that isolated Kis protein mainly has a flexible coil structure (our unpublished results), the latter hypothesis seems unlikely
In this study, we show that the well-ordered N-terminal domain adopts the RHH fold whereas the C-terminal region is highly flexible in solution.
The lower number of NOEs found for the C-terminal portion of ParD is in agreement with the dynamic behavior already described for this protein, indicating an unstructured domain. Mainly intraresidual NOEs could be identified for the flexible C-terminal part of ParD.
The authors do not provide region boundaries. The region with high flexibility was determined based on the NMR structure PDB:2an7 using CYRANGE to include the bit that shows high RMSD between various models. This region however contains secondary structural elements and therefore isn't fully flexible.
In aqueous buffer (Fig. 4 A), it can be deduced from the intensity of the negative 200 nm band that nonorganized structures are predominant (29). TableI reveals that there is no α helix in aqueous buffer excepted for Tat Mal and Tat Z2, which could have a short helix of eight to nine residues.
The six synthetic Tat proteins can bind to TAR RNA (Fig.3) and can inhibit PKR (data not shown).
In each case, Tat was added to the cell buffer, and therefore expression of β-gal up to the control means that the synthetic Tat was able to cross the cytoplasmic and nucleus membranes, bind TAR, and interact with cellular cofactors.
The authors show an increase in β-galactosidase expression through a transactivation assay with HeLa cells transfected with a LTR HIV-1 β-gal plasmid and purified TAT protein.
All peptides showed very poor NOESY spectra at 20°C (1-3).
Peptide R13 did not show any long-range NOE (more than four residues apart) and only two medium-range NOEs, suggesting that this peptide behaves as a random coil in solution, not showing any structural tendency.
Interpretable electron density begins at the N-terminus with residue 4 of the native sequence and ends at residue 73. Residues 74 through 112 were not visible in the electron density, and accordingly not modelled.
The structure contains 32 unstructured residues at the N terminus, one α-helix (residues 74–79) and five β-strands (residues 35–42, 47–50, 58–61, 83–91, and 95–99). The antiparallel β-strands are arranged in the order 3–2–1–4–5, with the first four strands in the Greek key topology.
Residues 62–73 of the loop preceding the α-helix had few structural restraints and this sequence therefore has a large variability in structural coordinates among the ensemble of structures.
Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of in vitro phosphorylated M156R revealed that approximately 75% of the phosphorylation occurred in the peptide LLGYEGHECILLDYLNYR, which includes Y67. Fragmentation analysis indicated that Y54, Y64 or Y67 could be phosphorylated (data not shown).
The P2 Int45–337 construct used yielded crystals from which X-ray diffraction data to 1.9 Å was collected (see Table 1). However, the collected data only revealed electron density corresponding to the C-terminal catalytic domain of P2 Int.
The N-terminal arm-binding domain of λ is disordered in the crystal structure.
Although our results are consistent with the first cleavage site (residue 364), it is also possible that the residues were disordered up to the second cleavage site (residue 372), and no electron density was observed (34).
Apparently proteolysis occurring during the 2 weeks required for crystal growth released the catalytic domain, and it is only this that could form well ordered crystals. 
Interestingly, the near-UV CD spectrum obtained at near physiological buffer conditions was virtually zero, and resembled the spectrum of the protein in the presence of 6m GdmCl (Fig. 3). These observations suggest that under native buffer conditions, the aromatic groups of NS2 are able to rotate freely and undergo no strong interactions with other groups within NS2 (48).
While far-UV CD and FT-IR spectroscopy detected the presence of a significant amount of secondary structure in NS2, near-UV CD and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the aromatic residues of the protein were highly assessable to the solvent, and did not undergo strong interactions with neighboring groups.
The flexibility observed in NS2 was intriguing, as with a length of 121 residues the protein is by far large enough to fold independently. The unusual set of characteristics found in the structure of NS2 (compactness, presence of a pronounced secondary structure, but absence of a tightly packed tertiary structure) are attributes typically connected with the molten globule state of proteins (52, 60).
As expected, these results indicate that the unfolding of NS2 is dominated by the unfolding of its secondary structure. Assuming a two-state mechanism of unfolding, the conformational stability ΔG(H20) of NS2 was estimated as about 6 kcal/mol as described in Ref. 38 (TableII). This value is at the lower end of the range of stabilities commonly observed for solvent-induced unfolding of globular proteins (ΔG(H20) ≈ 5–10 kcal/mol) (55).

The unusual set of characteristics found in the structure of NS2 (compactness, presence of a pronounced secondary structure, but absence of a tightly packed tertiary structure) are attributes typically connected with the molten globule state of proteins (52, 60).
In contrast, if NS2 was added to ANS in the presence of 6 m GdmCl, no such interaction was observed. These results suggest that NS2 possesses a loosely packed hydrophobic core that is accessible to the solvent, as expected for a folded protein with a dynamic tertiary structure.
Furthermore, isolated NS2 strongly interacted with the hydrophobic dye ANS suggesting that hydrophobic clusters within the structure of the protein were assessable to the solvent as well (51).
Addition of acrylamide led to rapid quenching of the tryptophan fluorescence, comparable to tryptophan quenching under denaturing conditions (TableI). The Stern-Volmer plot of the quenching reaction showed upward curvature, indicating that both tryptophan residues of NS2 were nearly equally assessable to the solvent (Fig. 4) (34).
While far-UV CD and FT-IR spectroscopy detected the presence of a significant amount of secondary structure in NS2, near-UV CD and fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that the aromatic residues of the protein were highly assessable to the solvent, and did not undergo strong interactions with neighboring groups.

There are two expermiments done with different fluorescence evidence: intrinsic florescence (tryptophan) and dye fluorescence (ANS).
These observations altogether indicate specific molecular association between M1 and NS2.
Since the NS2 protein was not detected in the M1-free RNP peak (Figs. 3B and 3C; fractions 3-5), we concluded that NS2 is able to rebind RNP cores in vitro only in the simultaneous presence of M1.
The above observation suggested direct physical association between M1 and NS2.
A functional domain on the NS2 with characteristics of a nuclear export signal was mapped: it interacts with cellular nucleoporins, can functionally replace the effector domain of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev protein and mediates rapid nuclear export when cross-linked to a reporter protein.
In the yeast two-hybrid system, only the viral NS2 protein was able to interact with different nucleoporins.
The NEP of influenza virus was able to interact strongly with Rab/hRIP1 and yRip1, less strongly with yNup100 and yNup116, and not with yNup1.

GST-x-NEP quickly migrated to the cytoplasm after microinjection into the nuclei of Madin–Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells (Figure 4A and C).
Therefore, we conclude that the NEP protein contains an NES within amino acids 11– 23.
The far-UV CD spectrum of the CTD (Fig. 2A) lacked the typical signatures of secondary structure, exhibiting only a negative signal at 200 nm. This pattern implied a high content of unstructured regions in the CTD.
To avoid on-resin aggregation during the synthesis authors substituted the residues 185, 179, 169 and 143 with pseudoproline dipeptide.
The CD spectrum of the CTD (Fig. 5A) in 5.4 mM DPC (green) and in 20 mM DPC (red), compared with the spectrum in buffer without DPC (blue), showed a red shift of ∼3 nm (from 199 to 202 nm). The minimum at 198 nm decreased, while the signal at 222 nm increased. The change in the CD spectrum indicates a structural change in the Vif CTD that was induced by the micellar environment.
The CTD eluted from the column with an elution volume of 11.3 ml. This volume gave an apparent molecular weight of 14.0 kDa, a value 2.5 times higher than the calculated mass of 5.8 kDa according to the calibration curve of standard MW markers. This indicated an extended conformation of the Vif CTD.
The 1H-NMR spectra of Vif145–192 showed a narrow dispersion of amide resonances, which is characteristic of a random coil (Fig. 4A). 
The dispersion of the amide protons in the 15N-HSQC spectrum (Fig. 4B) was in a narrow range of 7.95–8.74 ppm, Δ = 0.79 ppm, characteristic of unfolded proteins and peptides.
The CD spectrum of the CTD (Fig. 5A) in 5.4 mM DPC (green) and in 20 mM DPC (red), compared with the spectrum in buffer without DPC (blue), showed a red shift of ∼3 nm (from 199 to 202 nm). The minimum at 198 nm decreased, while the signal at 222 nm increased. The change in the CD spectrum indicates a structural change in the Vif CTD that was induced by the micellar environment.
Vif141–192 was titrated into fluorescein-labeled ElonginC76–111 and the resulting binding curve was fit to 1:1 binding model, resulting in Kd of 11.0 ± 0.6 µM (Fig. 5B).
Vif145–192 bound the ElonginC peptide with similar affinity, Kd = 12.5 ± 0.3 µM.
The CD spectrum of Vif CTD—ElonginC76–111 mixture at 1:1 molar ratio (Fig. 5C) gave an average between the unbound spectra of the CTD and the free ElonginC76–111, indicating that there is no significant change in the CTD structure upon binding to ElonginC76–111 at this molar ratio.
Membrane localization is required for Vif function during HIV-1 replication. To provide a quantitative measure of the biological activity of the mutant Vif proteins, a transient complementation assay was used to examine the abilities of the mutant Vif proteins to complement a single round of HIV-1 replication in trans (Fig. 3) (5, 13). The expression of wild-type Vif in trans in this assay restores the replication of a  vif-defective virus to the wild-type level (5, 8). In the absence of Vif expressed in trans, replication of the vif-positive virus was approximately 10-fold greater than that of the vif-negative virus.
The biological activities of the mutant Vif proteins correlated directly with their membrane binding activities in vitro (Fig. 3), indicating that Vif function is likely to require membrane localization.
However, no virus replication was detected in H9 cultures transfected with the B1,  B2, or B4 HIV-1 mutant virus DNAs. These results confirm the absence or near absence of Vif function in the B1, B2, and B4 mutants during HIV-1 replication in nonpermissive cells. Moreover, the direct correlation between the loss of biological activity and the loss of membrane binding of Vif during HIV-1 replication in infected cells (Fig. 2B) indicates that membrane localization is likely to be required for Vif function in vivo.
Virus replication was monitored by measuring the reverse transcriptase activity in the culture supernatant.
Full-genome-length minus-strand DNA was not detectable in vif mutant virions even when the blots were overexposed to visualize the short DNA products at an intensity similar to that of the wild type. The blots were rehybridized with the gag/pol(2) probe, which detects minus-strand DNA which has been reverse transcribed through the left half of the genome. Hybridization with the gag/pol(2) probe gave results similar to those obtained with the U3(2) probe, indicating that minus-strand synthesis was discontinuous with initiation at multiple sites.
The preceding experiment indicates that vif mutant virions are defective in their ability to synthesize minus-strand DNA. To determine the effect of Vif on synthesis of the plus strand, the blots from the preceding experiment were reprobed with U3 and gag/pol riboprobes of minus-strand polarity. The U3(1) probe detects initial plus-strand DNA products immediately adjacent to the 39 PPT. The gag/pol(1) probe detects plus-strand DNA products synthesized after the second template switch or initiated at the central PPT. In wild-type virions, the U3(1) and gag/pol(1) probes detected plus-strand DNA products of 0.5 to 9.7 kb (Fig. 3B). In contrast, plus-strand DNA products longer than 4 kb could not be detected in vif mutant virions even when the blots were overexposed to visualize the short DNA products at an intensity similar to that of the wild type.
The PDB shows the disorder region from 676-775 (envelope protein E).
The PDB shows the disorder region from 2742-2761 (NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase).
The PDB shows the disorder region from 2947-2963 (NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase).
The main structural regions are distinguished by their average backbone solvent accessibility (Fig. 3, left panel): the disordered N-terminal backbone is highly exposed, the flexible fold is partially accessible, and the conserved fold is mostly inaccessible to the solvent.
We found that Pup runs at 14 kDa on an SDS gel as demonstrated previously.
Moreover, a CD spectrum of Pup under physiological condition displays a single minimum, at approx. 200 nm,
which is the characteristic of unstructured proteins (Figure 2D).
This observation further strengthens the suggestion that Pup is an
IDP. Meanwhile, there is a broad but weak negative ‘shoulder’
peak between 218 nm and 230 nm, implying the existence of
a small proportion of residual secondary structure
Puriﬁed Pup displays an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa
(Figure 2C), in comparison to a theoretical molecular mass of
8 kDa. The abnormal electrophoresis shift rate of Pup in SDS/PAGE might reﬂect its amino acid composition bias and extended
conformation.
A spectrum recorded on Pup reflects that
of a disordered polypeptide with negative ellipticity near 200 nm and low ellipticity at 190 and
222 nm (Figure 3a). Moreover, induced thermal melting did not produce the spectral transition
characteristic of cooperative protein unfolding, thus providing further evidence for Pup being
an intrinsically disordered protein (Figure 3b).
Size exclusion chromatrography by FPLC reveals that 6.9 kDa Pup has a larger
hydrodynamic radius than 8.6 kDa ubiquitin.
Pup also elutes earlier than expected during size exclusion
chromatography however. It directly follows the 16.7 kDa ubiquitin receptor Rpn13 and elutes
significantly earlier than 8.6 kDa ubiquitin (Figure 1b), which forms a compact structure
(Figure 1c)
Even in the absence of denaturant, the CD spec-
trum of Pup displays a strongly negative mean molar ellipticity
with a minimum at slightly below 200 nm, a feature indicative of
poorly structured proteins. However, a broad and low-amplitude negative band at around 225 nm predicts a low content of second-
ary structure.
CD analysis of Pup indicates that Pup is mostly disordered and
contains only a small amount of secondary structure.
Residues Mpa1-51, Pup1-20, Pup52-64 were also disordered in the crystal
structure of Pup:Mpa1-234 complex structure
Mpa46-51, Pup52-64 residues are
disordered in Mpa46-96:Pup21-64 complex structure.
 The C-terminal 52-64 residues of Pup were also disordered in the crystal, similar to what we observed in the Pup21-64:Mpa46-96 crystal structure; this unstructured region might serve as a flexible linker between the induced α-helix and the C-terminus that forms an isopeptide bond with a substrate.
Full-length Pup alone is randomly coiled and extended under physiologically relevant conditions in vitro. The randomly coiled state of Pup may increase its target capture radius, allowing it to find the proteasomal ATPase more easily. Once the C-terminal part of Pup contacts the Mpa coiled-coil, the pupylated substrate is “reeled” into the proteasomal ATPase, and the Pup N-terminus is gradually forced towards the OB channel in Mpa. The pulling of Pup’s N-terminus into the OB channel might subsequently pull the Pup helix away from the Mpa coiled-coil, causing Pup to unfold and thread further into the channel to reach the Mpa AAA region. This notion is supported by our structure demonstrating the displacement of the N-terminal half of the Pup helix (residues 21-30) from the Mpa coiled-coil (Fig. 2a-b), and by the observation that this region of Pup interacts more weakly with Mpa than the C-terminal half.
Based on our crystal structures and the existing biochemical data, we propose the following
mechanism of substrate recognition in the Pup-proteasome system (Fig. 3c): (I) Pup is
initially in an unfolded state when covalently linked to a protein substrate by its C-terminus via an isopeptide bond 15,16,18,21; (II) unstructured Pup folds into an α-helix, using the
Mpa coiled-coil as a template; and (III) the protein substrate, along with Pup, is pulled into
the central channel of the proteasomal ATPase at the expense of ATP hydrolysis 5,22. At the
interface between Mpa and the 20S core particle, Pup might either be removed by a
“depupylase” 23, or be pushed by Mpa further into the 20S core and degraded along with the
substrate.
Full-length Pup alone is
randomly coiled and extended under physiologically relevant conditions in vitro. The
randomly coiled state of Pup may increase its target capture radius, allowing it to find the
proteasomal ATPase more easily.
The Pup region extending from Ser21 to Ala51 folded into an α-helix, apparently using the
Mpa coiled-coil as a template.

Mpa coiled-coil as a template.
The Pup helix interacted in an anti-parallel fashion with the lower half of the Mpa
coiled-coil (Fig. 1c). The Pup surface interacting with the Mpa coiled-coil was mainly
hydrophobic and involved two patches of leucine zipper-like interactions: a smaller patch
between Leu32 of Pup and Leu87 and Ala86 of Mpa-Ha; and an extensive patch formed by
Leu39, Leu40, Ile43, Val46, and Leu47 of Pup, Ala80, Leu73 of Mpa Ha, and Leu85,
Leu84, Ala80, and Leu77 of Mpa Hb (Fig. 1d).
We used 1 H, 15 N HSQC experiments to test whether our Pup sample was functional for Mpa binding. S21–K61 attenuated upon Mpa addition and new Mpa-bound Pup resonances appeared
As expected for a disordered protein, the chemical shift dispersion of 15 N is rather good, whereas amide 1 H chemical
shifts were dispersed over a narrow range from 7.8 to 8.6 p.p.m.,
which characterizes an unfolded protein.
Almost all of the heteronuclear NOEs are negative, indicating that most of the polypeptide chain adopts large amplitude ﬂuctuations on a subnanosecond time scale. This implies a highly ﬂexible state of Pup.
In the present paper, SPR (surface plasmon resonance) and NMR perturbation studies imply that the C-terminus of Pup, ranging from residues 30 to 59, binds
to Mpa probably through a hydrophobic interface.
At the same time, the weakening of
some other cross-peaks from residues in the region 32–55 was
observed (Figures 6A and 6B). Most of these perturbed residues
are hydrophobic, implying that Pup binds to Mpa via hydrophobic
interactions. This is consistent with the observations from the SPR
experiment.
The perturbed residues, most of
which are hydrophobic, are located in the region 30 to 59. These
observations suggest that Pup binds to Mpa via the last 30
amino acids, mainly through a hydrophobic interaction.
We plotted the difference between the chemical shift values of Pup’s Cα and Hα atoms relative
to those of randomly coiled values applying sequence-dependent corrections 21 to find very
little deviation from the random coil values (Figure 2b). Only A51–A57 demonstrated a trend
towards helicity with slight, but consistent Cα downfield shifting and Hα upfield shifting
Compared to ubiquitin 22 , Pup exhibits significantly smaller hetNOE
values, with an average of 0.16 (at 800 MHz; Figure 4c) compared to ubiquitin’s average of
0.75 (at 750 MHz) 22 , thus revealing an increase of high frequency motions. Pup’s last three
C-terminal residues, its N-terminal end, and R29–K31 demonstrate enhanced flexible (Figure
4c). R29–K31 and V55–V59 exhibit faster than average R N (N X ) values (Figure 4b), providing
further evidence that these two regions undergo conformational exchange.
Residues Mpa1-51, Pup1-20, Pup52-64 were also disordered in the crystal
structure of Pup:Mpa1-234 complex structure
The [ 15 N, 1 H]-HSQC spectrum of Pup shows poor dispersion
which is characteristic for an unfolded protein
We characterized the degree of ﬂexibility in the backbone of
Pup using the 15 N{ 1 H}-NOE experiment (Fig. 3b,c). Whereas the
N- and C-terminal residues show negative NOE values indicating
unrestricted motion of the N–H bond vector on the nanosecond
timescale, most residues of Pup have values between 0.2 and 0.4,
showing some degree of motional restriction of the backbone
(Fig. 3b and c). This conﬁrms that Pup is not entirely unstructured
in its free form.
15 N{ 1 H}-NOE experiment indicates that the protein
is partially structured, although it does not appear to occupy one
single favored conformation. Structure calculations using as input
the nearly complete resonance assignments and the NOESY spectra
do not converge to a single folded conformation. However, the res-
idues 50–58 adopt a helical conformation. Although this region
shows residual helical structure in these preliminary calculations,
the remainder of Pup occupies a range of conformations.
The observed
line-broadening clearly indicates interaction between Pup and
Mpa-CC. The most strongly affected 1 H– 15 N signals identify the
Mpa-CC binding region in Pup between residues 21 and 58.
The N-terminal region (1-39) is missing but it was not mentioned in the article.
The C-terminal region (115-124) is missing but it was not mentioned in the article.

In agreement with the previous study of PTN [27], we found that PTN is comprised of two TSR domains flanked by unstructured termini. Because no interdomain NOE was detected between the CTD and NTD, the two domains appear to be largely independent of each other and do not have a well-defined interdomain orientation.
The structured regions based on inspection of 2n6f are as follows: N-tail: 32-46; NTD (47-83), CTD (99-139), C-tail (140-168). The hinge region that is not constrained to the CTD corresponds to residues: 84-95. Numbering in the paper does not follow UNIPROT numbering. i.e. F63 corresponds to F95 and K60-K61 corresponds to UNIPROT: K92, K93.

Definitive NOE cross-peaks between CTD and residues in the hinge segment connecting the two TSR domains (residues 58–66) can be observed. Specifically, aromatic protons of F63 can be seen contacting side chains of Y69, V103 and I105 (Fig. 1D). Because F63 is the only residue with significant contacts with the CTD and the tolerance in these distance constraints is relatively large, the hinge shows larger positional variation than the TSR domains.

Our structure shows that PTN possesses large basic surfaces on both of its structured domains and also that residues in the hinge segment connecting the domains have significant contacts with the C-terminal domain. Our analysis of PTN–CS interactions showed that the C-terminal tail of PTN is essential for maintaining stable interactions with chondroitin sulfate A, the type of CS commonly found on PTPRZ.

Our analysis of PTN–CS interactions showed that the C-terminal tail of PTN is essential for maintaining stable interactions with chondroitin sulfate A, the type of CS commonly found on PTPRZ.
Furthermore, studies have also shown that truncated PTN missing the C-terminal tail (residues 115–136) can be found in vivo in significant quantities but is incapable of signaling through PTPRZ [35–37]. In addition, peptides derived from the C-terminal tail of PTN can inhibit PTPRZ-dependent cell migration [38]. This implies that the C-terminal tail, which does not contribute to heparin binding, plays an important role in interactions with PTPRZ.
However, truncated PTN failed to bind to CSA entirely, whereas wild-type PTN binds CSA with high affinity (Kd ~ 17 nM). These data indicate that the Cterminal tail of PTN is crucial for maintaining strong interactions with CSA, the type of CS commonly found on PTPRZ.
Work reported in the present study shows that, although the C-terminal tail plays a minimal role in binding the highly sulfated CSE, it is vital for maintaining stable interactions with CSA. Because more than 90% of disaccharides in the GAG chains of PTPRZ are CSA disaccharides [42], the Cterminal tail of PTN is demonstrated to be a crucial mediator of the interaction of PTN with PTPRZ. 
The C-terminal truncation: residues 115-136 discussed by the authors corresponds to residues 147-168 of the Uniprot entry

In the absence of the Cterminal tail, CTD residues bound CSA dp8 with a Kd of only ~ 320 µM. Similarly, the CSA dp8 binding Kd of the NTD also doubled to 1.2 mM. This indicates that removal of the C-terminal tail has a significant effect on the affinity of PTN for CSA dp8 and is consistent with the results of the ELISA. It should be noted that the inability of truncated PTN to bind native CSA in ELISA does not contradict the results of the NMR titrations. The discrepancy can be explained by the successive washes required in ELISA, which prevents weak interactions

PTN112–136 inhibited binding of PTN to anb3 integrin, and as shown by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements, specifically interacted with the specificity loop of the extracellular domain of b3. Moreover, it abolished PTN-induced FAK Y397 phosphorylation, similarly to the effect of a neutralizing anb3-selective antibody
PTN112_136 AFFECTED THE INTERACTION OF PTN WITH  anb3 INTEGRIN. Since both RPTPb/z and anb3 integrin are required for PTN-induced HUVEC migration [Polykratis et al., 2005; Mikelis et al., 2009], we studied whether PTN112–136 affects interaction of PTN with alphav b3, RPTPb/z, or both. Cells were grown in the presence or absence of PTN112–136 and in each case, 3mg of total protein from cell lysates were immunoprecipitated for anb3 or RPTPb/z and analyzed for the presence of PTN. PTN112–136 inhibited interaction of PTN with anb3 (Fig. 3A) but not RPTPb/z (Fig. 3B) in HUVEC.
The numbering by the authors differs from the uniprot numbering. Residue 112-136 correspond to 144-168 of the uniprot numbering.

Moreover, it abolished PTN-induced FAK Y397 phosphorylation, similarly to the effect of a neutralizing anb3-selective antibody
PTN112_136 SPECIFICALLY INTERACTED WITH THE CYSTEINE LOOP 177–184 OF THE b3 INTEGRIN EXTRACELLULAR DOMAIN. Since PTN interacts with anb3 through the specificity loop of the b3 integrin extracellular domain [Mikelis et al., 2009], we studied the interaction of PTN112–136 with a synthetic peptide that corresponds to aminoacids 177–184 and mimics the cysteine loop of b3 (B3 peptide) by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
Typical analyte–receptor binding kinetics are presented in Figure 4B. PTN112–136 and B3 peptide formed a relatively high affinity complex. The affinity of B3 peptide for PTN112–136 was much higher than the affinity of the B3 scrambled peptide.
In the present study, we show that the C-terminal region of PTN is responsible for binding to the Cys-loop of the b3 subunit, playing a major role in the interaction of PTN with anb3 and the resulting stimulation of cell migration.

PTN112_136 AFFECTED THE INTERACTION OF PTN WITH  anb3 INTEGRIN. Since both RPTPb/z and anb3 integrin are required for PTN-induced HUVEC migration [Polykratis et al., 2005; Mikelis et al., 2009], we studied whether PTN112–136 affects interaction of PTN with alphav b3, RPTPb/z, or both.

Moreover, it abolished PTN-induced FAK Y397 phosphorylation, similarly to the effect of a neutralizing anb3-selective antibody
Collectively, our data suggest that although PTN112–136 induces some of the signaling pathways triggered by PTN, it inhibits PTN-induced angiogenic activities through inhibition of PTN binding to anb3 integrin. 
Based on the assumption that integrin-dependent Y397 autophosphorylation of FAK is the first step of its activation [Mitra and Schlaepfer, 2006], we studied whether PTN affects Y397 phosphorylation of FAK through anb3, as well as the effect of PTN112–136. As shown in Figure 5, PTN at the concentration of 100 ng/ml that causes the maximal effect on HUVEC migration [Polykratis et al., 2005], induced Y397 FAK auto-phosphorylation, an effect completely abolished by the anb3 neutralizing antibody LM609 or by PTN112–136
PTN induces Y397 FAK phosphorylation through anb3, an effect completely abolished by PTN112–136. FAK activation is required for integrin-mediated cell migration [Sieg et al., 1999] and the autophopshorylation on Y397 is prerequisite for the subsequent binding and activation from c-src [Mitra et al., 2005]. It seems that PTN binding to the cysteine loop 177–184 of anb3 leads to the initial activation of FAK, its interaction with the activated c-src and the induction of the migratory response, and PTN112–136 blocks this process (Fig. 8).
The numbering by the authors differs from the uniprot numbering. Residue 112-136 correspond to 144-168 of the uniprot numbering.
NMR spectroscopy studies showed that PTN112–136 was characterized by conformational flexibility and absence of any element of secondary structure at room temperature, although the biologically active peptide segment 123–132 may adopt a defined structure at lower temperature.
The NMR data for PTN112–136 suggest a conformation with no well-defined secondary structure elements for this peptide, due to the absence of any long-range and the limited number of medium-range (i,i.3) NOEs (Fig. 7B). However, a backbone bend is formed by residues Glu127–Gln131, indicating the formation of a segment with local folded structure in the conformational ensemble (Fig. 7C). As far as the nature of the peptide bond for both prolines is concerned, analysis of the proline 13C resonances observed for PTN112–136, demonstrate in both cases, Pro115 and Pro117, the existence of a dominant trans conformation. Cb of Pro115 is found to be at 33.172 ppm, while Cg is found at 29.632 ppm. The difference in ppm is 3.54, indicating that
the dominant conformation of the Lys114–Pro115 peptide bond of the model ensemble is trans and that cis–trans isomerization is not detectable in NMR time scale. The corresponding Dbg value for Pro117 is found to be 4.021, suggesting a trans conformation for the peptide bond between residues Lys116–Pro117

Based on the assumption that integrin-dependent Y397 autophosphorylation of FAK is the first step of its activation [Mitra and Schlaepfer, 2006], we studied whether PTN affects Y397 phosphorylation of FAK through anb3, as well as the effect of PTN112–136. As shown in Figure 5, PTN at the concentration of 100 ng/ml that causes the maximal effect on HUVEC migration [Polykratis et al., 2005], induced Y397 FAK auto-phosphorylation, an effect completely abolished by the anb3 neutralizing antibody LM609 or by PTN112–136
In an effort to better characterize PTN112–136 and to identify the
likely minimum amino acid sequence involved in its biological
activity, we elucidated the structural features of PTN112–136 by NMR
spectroscopy. The peptide proved to be highly flexible in solution at
room temperature.
The numbering by the authors differs from the uniprot numbering. Residue 112-136 correspond to 144-168 of the uniprot numbering.
Here we present the first crystal structure of a prokaryotic VapBC complex, VapBC-5 from M. tuberculosis. The toxin, VapC-5, contains 126 residues (Mr 14.0 kDa) and the antitoxin, VapB-5, contains 34 residues (Mr 3.8 kDa)
The structure of VapB-5 antitoxin shows clear electron density for 33 residues out of 93 (86 native and seven from the vector). The missing residues are part of the N-terminal region that is predicted to bind to DNA
only the NG domains were ordered within the crystal, and the auxiliary domains and SRP RNA were degraded or too flexible
The monomeric PN fragment displayed a CD spectrum at 25 °C typical of a disordered conformation with a predominant minimum at ∼200 nm, no components of regular secondary structure, and the expected increase in secondary structure content at high temperature due to strengthening of hydrophobic interactions, a typical feature of IDP regions (Figure 2C).
The monomeric PN and PC fragments presented ratios (MWSEC/MWSLS) of 2.7 ± 0.1 and 3.1 ± 0.1, respectively, which can be explained by the extended conformation and low compactness of the polypeptide chain typical of IDPs.
The monomeric PN and PC fragments presented ratios (MWSEC/MWSLS) of 2.7 ± 0.1 and 3.1 ± 0.1, respectively, which can be explained by the extended conformation and low compactness of the polypeptide chain typical of IDPs.
The monomeric PC fragment presented a CD spectrum characterized by a small negative band at 220 nm indicative of some degree of α-helical content and a minimum centered at 204 nm, which indicates a mixture of contributions from disorder (200 nm) and α-helix (208 nm), showing that PC features both structured and disordered elements in contrast to the fully disordered conformation of the PN fragment (Figure 2F).
Thermal denaturation of full-length P revealed a structural transition between 5 and 60 °C, with some degree of cooperativity (Figure 4A, top panel). Within this temperature range, PTET, PNTET, and PN showed no thermal transition (Figure 4A, bottom panel) while PC and PTETC showed transitions similar to that of P (Figure 4B), in accordance with the results depicted in Figure 2.
 In particular at pH 3.0, the PC fragment (pI = 4.34) presented an increase in α-helical content (Figure 8A), which resulted in substantial compaction of PC as determined by SEC, changing the MWSEC/MWSLS ratio from 3.1 ± 0.2 to 1.3 ± 0.1, similar to that of a globular protein (Figure 8B).
These findings supported the pre-molten globule-like nature of the PC module, whereas charge neutralization drives the extended structure to adopt a globular fold with a high degree of α-helical content.
With the protein digestion protocol we used (see Experimental Procedures), we obtained a major species of fragment Y of 4959.6 Da determined by mass spectrometry, which fits well with a peptide containing three additional residues (Ser-Ala-Arg) in the carboxy terminal region (peptide starting at Ser 119 and ending at Arg 163 with a theoretical mass of 4958.4 Da).

Therefore, P protein was doubly digested with a mixture of sequencing grade trypsin and chymotrypsin. This was followed by gel filtration chromatography, as described previously for fragment X. A peak eluting as a ∼120 kDa species showed a single band of ∼9 kDa in a SDS-PAGE gel [labeled Y* in Fig. 5(B)], that migrated faster than fragment X.

We then shortened the P230–241 region at either end and produced the corresponding GST–P proteins in E. coli. Mutants PΔN231, PΔN232 and PΔN233 – the latter retaining only the nine most C-terminal amino acids of P – were still able to pull down N with the same efficiency as PΔN230 (Fig. 6c, dF6).
On the other hand, removal of the very C-terminal amino acid of P completely abolished its capacity to pull down N, just like the other mutants tested lacking 2 or 3 aa from the C terminus (Fig. 6c, dF6). Thus, the C-terminal P segment spanning aa 234–241 appears to contain the minimal region for efficient interaction with RNA–N in this system.
In order to characterize and compare the complexes co-purified by using either the oligomeric full-length P or the C-terminal fragment PΔN161, the samples were analysed by negative-staining electron microscopy (EM) after proteolytic separation from GST. Fig. 2F2(a, b) shows nucleocapsid-like structures eluted from GST beads for both P–N (a) and PΔN161–N (b).
The second peak (P3), which eluted at 16.9 ml, only absorbed at 220 nm and contained the PΔN161 fragment. Its apparent mass was between 20.2 and 47.2 kDa, higher than its predicted mass of 10 kDa, presumably due to a markedly non-globular shape of the fragment (Tarbouriech et al., 2000).

On the other hand, removal of the very C-terminal amino acid of P completely abolished its capacity to pull down N, just like the other mutants tested lacking 2 or 3 aa from the C terminus (Fig. 6c, dF6). Thus, the C-terminal P segment spanning aa 234–241 appears to contain the minimal region for efficient interaction with RNA–N in this system.
The entire β-flap was built into the electron density map, but there was no clear density for two terminal segments of gp33, so only residues 32–102 (of the full 112) were modeled in the structure (Fig. 1). Analysis of the crystals indicated that they contained both proteins without proteolytic degradation (Fig. S1C), so the N-terminal 31 and C-terminal 10 residues of gp33 are presumed disordered in the crystals.

Amino acids 1–24 and 118–143 at each terminus, as well as the His tag, do not have any observable long-range NOEs and have dynamics indicative of random coil conformations (data not shown).
Authors are not considering the first M residue, thus the disorder region is 1-25.

Deletion of eIF1A-CT16 affects a distinct surface on eIF1A-OB, which is a subset of that affected by deletion of eIF1A-CTT (compare Figure ​2B and Supplementary Figure S1A). Adding eIF1A-CT16 to 15N-labeled eIF1AΔC or eIF1AΔNC affects most of the same surfaces affected by the respective deletion (data not shown). Therefore, eIF1A-CT16 contacts the OB domain at a specific surface.
The affinity of Fl-eIF1A-CT7 for eIF5B-D4 was 12 μM. Competition FA assays using Fl-eIF1A-CT7 showed that the binding affinities of eIF1A-CT16 (12 μM) and of the full 26-residue eIF1A-CTT (12 μM) were similar (Figure ​3A and B, Table 1). In contrast, the affinity of full-length eIF1A for eIF5B-D4 was 39 μM, much weaker than that of eIF1A-CTT (Figure ​3B and Table ​1).
For VapB30, we were unable to build the residues Met1–Val46 and residues Tyr77–Ala84 because of ambiguous or missing electron density in crystal form II. In crystal form I, the electron density of the residues Met1–Val46 was also absent; however, additional residues (Tyr77–Glu79) in chains B and H were visible in the electron density map.
no electron density visible for residues from 745 to 765 of chain A and 743 to 765 of chain B, respectively
Surprisingly, the final model contains only 481 amino acids, including residues from Ala372 to Asp853, no electron density visible for the fragment from residues Met1 to Ala371.
In the final model, both monomers include the residues from 372 to 853, but no electron density visible for residues from 745 to 765 of chain A and 743 to 765 of chain B, respectively.
Sequence analysis showed that the C terminal of PigE (residue 372–853) is the putative catalytic domain, which shares some homology with the PLP-dependent aminotransferase family proteins, but the function for the N-terminal domain (residue 1–371) is unclear.
The PXXP motif in the present structure is from residues 74–80 while the 30-residue disordered loop distal to this motif ranges from residues 151–180.
There are two structural analysis in the PDB showing disorder regions:151-180 and 152-180. 152-180 comprises both structural analysis
On the other hand, the N-terminal anchor domain is disordered in the full-length structure.
Crystal diffraction and poor reproducibility were problems faced during the experiments and in hindsight were probably due to the disordered N-terminal domain as explained in ‘Results’.
The NMR data clearly indicate that the fairly long N- and C-terminal regions (residues 1-55 and 145-189) of sclerostin are highly flexible and completely disordered (Fig. 2A).
The IDR characterized in the publication residues 1-55 corresponds to region 25-79 of the amino acid sequence.

The IDR characterized in the publication residues 145-189 corresponds to region 169-213 of the amino acid sequence.
In common with the N- and C-terminal regions, loop 2 appears to be relatively flexible and adopts a diverse range of conformations within the family of converged structures.
The loop 2 corresponds to the region 110-133.
Identification of the Binding Site of an Antibody That Antagonizes the Inhibition of Wnt Signaling by Sclerostin
As described for heparin, the location of the inhibitory antibody binding site on sclerostin was mapped by following the changes in the positions of backbone amide NMR signals (15N and 1H) induced by the binding of the Fab fragment of the inhibitory antibody.
Examples of significantly affected amide signals of sclerostin are highlighted in the selected regions of 1H,15N HSQC spectra shown in Fig. 8A. The combined minimal shift values for the backbone amide signals versus protein sequence are shown in the histogram in Fig. 8B, which indicates that the majority of the perturbed residues are located within the flexible and solvent exposed loop 2 region of sclerostin (Fig. 8C).
The predicted binding of heparin to sclerostin was confirmed by detecting changes in the positions of backbone amide NMR signals (15N and 1H) induced by binding of a dodecameric heparin fragment (Fig. 5A). The binding of the heparin fragment clearly results in very significant shifts in the positions of backbone amide signals from residues located mainly in loops 2 and 3, in particular, Glu-53, Ser-55, Arg-57, His-60, Ser-82, Gly-83, Leu-91, Trp-100, Trp-101, Arg-102, Ser-104, Asp-113, Arg-114, Tyr-115, Arg-116, Ala-117, Arg-119, Val-120, Gln-121, Leu-122, Leu-123, Glu-128, Ala-129, Arg-131, Ala-132, Val-135, Leu-137, Val-138, Cys-141, Lys-144, and Leu-146 (Fig. 5B).
To understand the interactions in detail, we determined high-resolution structures of DKK1 and SOST peptides in complex with LRP6 E1.
In the case of the SOST peptide, the Ile is followed by an intervening Gly before the basic Arg residue. This reorients the peptide backbone and places the Arg side chain in a more peripheral location on the acidic patch of LRP6 (Figure 4B).
To understand the interactions in detail, we determined high-resolution structures of DKK1 and SOST peptides in complex with LRP6 E1.
Taken together, the binding data and the effects on Wnt signaling confirm that the conserved “NXI” motif is functionally relevant for DKK1 and SOST inhibition of those Wnts signaling through binding to E1E2, and that the DKK1 CRD2 interaction with E3E4 is important only for inhibition of a different subset of Wnt ligands.
For wild-type DKK1 and SOST, strong inhibition of WNT1-dependent signaling is observed.

The luciferase repoter assay was used to detect the interaction and DEXA scans measured the total bone marrow density.
Heparin Mediates the Localization of Sclerostin at the Cell Surface
 Additions of heparin to the cell culture for 3 h before the harvest of the supernatant resulted in a striking dose-dependent increase in the amount of sclerostin detected in the supernatant without affecting the total amount of sclerostin produced by the cells, as shown in Fig. 6A.
The experimental data reported here clearly indicates that the interaction between heparan sulfate and sclerostin will result in a significantly higher concentration of the protein at the surface of responsive cells, which may facilitate its regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in a more spatially controlled and temporally dependent manner.
Far UV CD spectra of CcdA37-72 at 25 °C. The spectrum in blue is of unbound CcdA37-72 and has the typical shape of a random coil spectrum.
Far UV CD spectra of CcdA37-72 at 25 °C. The spectrum in blue is of unbound CcdA37-72 and has the typical shape of a random coil spectrum. The spectrum in green is the difference spectrum  between  the  CcdB2:CcdA37-72  complex  and  CcdB2,  thus  corresponding  to  that  of  CcdA37-72 in its bound state. Here the typical spectral shape corresponding to α-helix is clearly visible.
Upon  addition  of  CcdA37-72 to  CcdB2,  the  CD  spectrum  of  CcdA37-72  undergoes  significant  changes.  Figure  S1A  compares  the  far  UV  CD  spectrum  of  CcdA37-72  in  its  free  state  and  in  complex  with  a  CcdB  dimer  (CcdB2:CcdA37-72  ratio  1:1).  The  latter  indicates  that  upon  complex formation CcdA37-72 folds to a largely α-helical conformation, in agreement with our crystallographic studies.
Upon addition of CcdA37-72 to CcdB2, the CD spectrum of CcdA37-72 undergoes significant changes. Figure S1A compares the far UV CD spectrum of CcdA37-72 in its free state and in complex with a CcdB dimer (CcdB2:CcdA37-72 ratio 1:1).
Binding studies using ITC, SPR, CD-, and fluorescence spectroscopy consistently yield a picture of the CcdB2 dimer possessing two binding sites for CcdA37-72, differing in affinity by a factor of at least 106 (Figure 2 and Figure S4). 
The  fingerprint  region  of  the  TOCSY  spectrum  of  CcdA37-72  shows  poor  chemical  shift  dispersion.   They   all   fall   in   the   range   between   7.8-8.6   ppm,   typical   for   random   coil   conformations
The near UV CD spectrum of CcdA37-72 lacks sharp peaks, which is an indication of disorder.
Fluorescence spectroscopy measurements of CcdA37-72 show a monotonic increase upon chemical unfolding with guanidinium chloride and the absence of a discrete folding/unfolding transition.
Sequential backbone and side-chain assignments localized the well-dispersed signals to residues 3–40. Values closer to random coil shifts were
observed for the C-terminal 30 residues, together
with three different conformations (labeled “a”, “b” and “c” in Figure 1(b) and (c)). These provide evidence that CcdA consists of two domains, a structured N terminus (CcdAN; Gln3–Arg40) and a much more flexible C terminus (CcdAC; Ala41– Trp72) which adopts different, partially stable conformations.
The CcdA R70K mutant was used in the NMR measurement that showed increased stability against proteolytic cleavage.
Purified CcdA41, however, contained almost no α-helical or β-sheet structure.
The intrinsic fluorescence of CcdA had an emission maximum at 346 nm, suggesting that both tryptophan residues are highly solvent-exposed (Fig. 8). 
Changes in CcdA fluorescence also suggest a conformational change in CcdA upon binding CcdB. The intrinsic fluorescence of CcdA41 was similar to that of CcdA and was blue-shifted to a similar extent upon binding of CcdB. The intrinsic fluorescence of CcdA had an emission maximum at 346 nm, suggesting that both tryptophan residues are highly solvent-exposed (Fig. 8). Addition of CcdB results in a dramatic blue shift in the fluorescence emission which had a maximum near 330 nm (Fig. 8), indicating that both tryptophan residues are buried in the complex. The intrinsic fluorescence of CcdA41 was similar to that of CcdA and was blue-shifted to a similar extent upon binding of CcdB (data not shown). Burial of the tryptophan residues could indicate that those residues form part of the bonding domain between CcdA and CcdB or that CcdB binding induces a conformational change in CcdA that moves the tryptophan residues away from the solvent into closer contact with other residues in the terminal a-helix.
In solution, CcdA37-72 behaves as a monomeric and intrinsically disordered protein and folds upon binding to CcdB. Electron density is observed for residues Ala41-Trp72, while residues Arg37-Arg40 remain disordered. Segment Arg40-Gly63 forms a long bent α-helix. Segment Ser64-Trp72, on the other hand, has a more irregular structure harboring just a single helical turn at its center.
The crystal structure of the CcdB2:CcdA37-72 complex is asymmetric with a single CcdA37-72 domain wrapped around the CcdB2 dimer in a largely α-helical conformation, burying a total combined molecular surface of 2850 Å2 for CcdA37-72 and CcdB2.
We found that coexpression with CcdA37-72 is sufficient to protect E. coli cells from CcdB. The
growth of cells cotransformed with plasmids coding for CcdB and CcdA37-72 (efficiency of plating [EOP] = 0.9 ± 0.2) is similar to the growth of cells transformed with plasmids coding for
CcdB and full-length CcdA (EOP = 0.8 ± 0.3). Cells transformed with a plasmid coding only for CcdB produce very few colonies (EOP = 0.002 ± 0.002). 
Binding studies using ITC, SPR, CD-, and fluorescence spectroscopy consistently yield a picture of the CcdB2 dimer possessing two binding sites for CcdA37-72, differing in affinity by a factor of at least 106 (Figure 2 and Figure S4).

In order to determine how many molar equivalents of CcdA37-72 are required to disrupt the GyrA592:CcdB2 complex, we performed a series of analytical gel filtration experiments where GyrA592:CcdB2 was preincubated with different molar equivalents of CcdA37-72. Adding a single equivalent of monomeric CcdA37-72 to GyrA592:CcdB2 fully dissociated this complex, producing GyrA592 and CcdB2:CcdA37-72 (Figure 3C), confirming the functional relevance of our crystal structure. This result directly links the high-affinity interaction between CcdB and CcdA37-72 to the rejuvenation process.
To map the regions of CcdA involved in the binding to the toxin CcdB a titration of unlabeled CcdB with increasing amounts of uniformly 13C/15N labeled CcdA was carried out. Significant chemical shift changes were observed for NH resonances of residues located within the C-terminal region of CcdA only (residues between Val46 and Asp71) and addition of CcdB had no effect on the N-terminal domain (Figure 4(a)). 
The residues located in CcdAC (green peaks; labels written in circles) were unaffected by residual proteases in the CcdB solution which successively digested CcdAN.
We observed that upon binding to CcdB, CcdAC becomes structured and that residues 46 to 72 are shielded in the complex.
Complex of CcdA and CcdB—CcdA and CcdB interact to form a stable complex that can be isolated by gel filtration (Fig. 1A) or native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2, A and C).
Complex of CcdA and CcdB—CcdA and CcdB interact to form a stable complex that can be isolated by gel filtration (Fig. 1A) or native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2, A and C).
CcdA41 was also degraded by Lon, but in this case similar degradation rates were observed with either ATP or AMPPNP.
While full length CcdA could only be degraded by Lon in the presence of ATP, CcdA41 was degraded by Lon independent of the presence of ATP.  This suggests that while full length CcdA has considerable amount of secondary structure, the C-terminal region (CcdA41) has not.
CcdB blocked activation of Lon ATPase activity by CcdA (Table IV), which suggests that CcdA can not interact with Lon when CcdA and CcdB are in a complex. Thus, CcdB protects CcdA probably by masking or making inaccessible those regions of CcdA normally recognized by Lon. CcdB also partially protects CcdA from degradation by proteases such as LysC and V8 protease.
Traces of proteases remaining in the CcdB solution digested CcdAN while CcdAC was protected against proteolysis even after weeks at room temperature.
Density was not observed for the amino acid residues 1-7, 89-96, 345 and the C-terminal His-tag of Cdk9, for the residues 1-6, 253-260 and 262-266 of Cyclin T1, and for the residues 50-86 of Tat.
Indeed, the residues 1-49 are ordered in the crystal structure of Tat•P-TEFb, while the density for the rest of Tat (residues 50-86) is not defined.
This region is ordered when bound to the positive transcription elongation factor, P-TEFb.

This region is 100% identical to that of Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 group M subtype B (isolate BH10) Tat protein, proved to be disordered.
In the absence of interacting partners, Tat does not have prominent secondary structure elements, indicating the flexible nature of free Tat proteins.
The same material was subjected to sequential Edman degradation, and the release of radioactive derivatives was monitored. Peaks of radioactivity were observed at cycles 6, 8, and 12, indicative of phosphorylation sites at these distances following an arginine or lysine residue. The only place that such a pattern occurs in the Tat-72 molecule is at serine 62, threonine 64, and serine 68 (Fig. 5C).
GST-Tat 86, GST-Tat 72, and their mutant variants, p18IS and C22G, all bound PKR, whereas the 48Δ Tat truncation and its associated mutants failed to bind PKR. In addition the Tat construct Tat 86Δ2/36, an N-terminal deletion of residues 2-36 from GST-Tat 86, successfully bound activated PKR. These data suggest that the Tat sequence contained between amino acids 49 and 72 is important for binding PKR, but the N-terminal and C-terminal residues 2-36 and 73-86 are dispensable.
Conversely, increasing the concentration of Tat protein, while maintaining a fixed concentration of eIF2, resulted in a marked reduction in eIF2 phosphorylation (lanes 5-8). These data suggest that Tat and eIF2 can compete as substrates for phosphorylation by autophosphorylated PKR. Considering the relative molecular masses of Tat and eIF2 (about 10 and 125 kDa, respectively), they appear to serve as substrates for PKR and as competitors on a comparable molar basis.
Activation of PKR by dsRNA is accompanied by autophosphorylation. When activated PKR catalyzes the phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), which results in the sequestration of a second initiation factor, the guanosine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B, leading to the inhibition of protein synthesis. This mode of translational shut down constitutes a host defense mechanism and, as such, is detrimental to the viral life cycle. The avoidance of the activation of PKR and/or eIF2 proteins serves as a viral strategy to circumvent this host response. 
In the absence of Tat, PKR was autophosphorylated in a dsRNA-dependent fashion (lanes 1 and 2). Preincubation of PKR with increasing concentrations of purified Tat-72 prior to the addition of dsRNA eliminated PKR autophosphorylation (lanes 3 and 4). As in previous experiments (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5), when the addition of Tat was delayed until after PKR activation by dsRNA had occurred, both Tat and PKR were phosphorylated (lane 5). These observations indicate that Tat-72 can inhibit the activation of PKR by dsRNA in vitro, as well as its activity in phosphorylating eIF2.

During purification, IcmR is slowly digested by an endogenous bacterial protease to form a smaller fragment that can account for ∼30-40% of the sample (Experimental Procedures, Figure 1C, lane 1).
This complex was trypsinized to remove flexible residues from the two proteins.

The N-terminal 76 amino acid residues are disordered; this flexible region is required for optimal activity.
Electron density for the N-terminal 76 residues was absent, indicating that it may be a flexible element.
To test the functional importance of the N terminus, we constructed a deletion mutant of Ref that lacked the 76 N-terminal amino acids and purified it. It proved to be devoid of Ref-mediated nuclease activity on ssDNA under normal reaction conditions (Fig. 7, lanes 11–13). Some RecA-dependent ssDNA cleavage was seen at much higher concentrations of the mutant Ref protein (10× and 100×; Fig. 7, lanes 14–21). Ref ΔN76 was completely deficient in DNA binding to a 50-mer oligonucleotide up to a concentration of 2.4 μm using the assay shown in Fig. 1 (data not shown). This indicates that the disordered N-terminal domain plays an essential role the DNA binding activity of Ref and also enhances the RecA-dependent nuclease activity. We note that these N-terminal 76 amino acid residues represent a very highly charged part of the protein.

The first a-helical region from residues 7 to 13 corresponds to the high affinity binding helix seen in the crystal structure. The second helix is from residue 34 to 43 of PKIa, and overlaps with the Nuclear Export Signal of PKIa. The remainder of PKIa is not structured. The experiments were done with the rabbit PKIa (Uniprot P61926), IDR is 100% identical.

A large portion, 209 residues of a total of 463 residues for the mature full-length protein, is missing in the electron density most likely due to α-chymotrypsin treatment of Olfm1. The final model consists of residues Val211–Phe477 and Arg210–Ala480 (the last two alanines Ala479 and Ala480 are from the NotI restriction site) for chains A and B, respectively, excluding loops Ala339–His352 in both chains.
We show that this small protein presents two subdomains linked by an 11-residue linker, with the N-subdomain lacking a well-defined conformation.
To supplement the structural characterisation of PX, we measured heteronuclear relaxation at 600 MHz. Of the 95 amino acid residues (474–568), 68 {1H}-15N nOes (Fig. 3), 68 R1 and 68 R2 (data not shown) could be measured. The resulting data confirm that residues 474–515 indeed present differential dynamic behaviour compared to residues 516–568. In particular, the {1H}-15N nOe reveals a rigid domain (516–568) linked to a flexible domain (474–504) by an even more flexible linker (505–515).
This model is validated by experimental RDCs and SAXS data measured from PX from Sendai virus, a molecule containing folded and unfolded domains, confirming both local conformational sampling and the average size and shape of the ensemble. Despite the highly disperse ensemble, regions of preferential structuring along the flexible chain of PX are detected.
In this study, experimental RDCs and SAXS data are combined with a conformational sampling algorithm to develop a structural model of the 57-aa unfolded domain of PX. Although they cover a smaller range than the RDCs measured in the folded domain, the N-NH and C′-NH RDC measured for PX aligned in 5% of C12E6/hexanol nevertheless present identifiable fine structure and values that are non-negligible compared with the folded domain.
57-aa including the 15 residues of the His-tag.
The assignment of this small protein has been made difficult due to the limited amount of regular secondary structure (the N-terminus before Pro58 is disordered) shown by chemical shift data and the absence of medium and long-range NOEs.
An isotopically 15N/13C double-labelled sample of the X protein spanning amino acids 474 to 568 of the phosphoprotein (accession number swiss-prot P04859) (corresponding respectively to residue 15 and 109 in our numbering scheme) was obtained from 4 L E. coli BL21 (DE3) culture in M9 minimal medium containing 1 g/l 15NH4Cl and 1 g/l 13C6-glucose as sole nitrogen and carbon sources.
The assignment of this small protein has been made difficult due to the limited amount of regular secondary structure (the N-terminus before Pro58 is disordered) shown by chemical shift data and the absence of medium and long-range NOEs. This suggests that a flexible linker is needed between the oligomerisation domain/polymerase binding site and the N-RNA binding domain for biological activity.
 (A) Overall rotational correlation time τc. Isotropic rotational diffusion with a correlation time of 7.3 ns was assumed for the structured part (519–568), whereas a local diffusion model was used for residues in the unstructured part.
Isotope-labeled samples of the PX domain (474–568) of SeV phosphoprotein P, including an N-terminal His tag and a factor Xa cleavage site (MRGSHHHHHHIEGR), were prepared as described previously (30).
All amide protons in the N-terminal part of PX exchanged within the dead time confirming the unstructured nature of this N-terminal subdomain.
From 474 to 518 is unstructured and from 519 to 568 structured.
The two alanines A-504 and A-507 both have high negative normalized order parameters. They are located in the stretch (504–508), which from the backbone 15N relaxation data was identified as a very flexible linker between the unstructured and structured domain; and this highly flexible character is clearly also sensed by the alanine Cα-Cβ axis. All other normalized order parameters in the unstructured part are also negative, meaning that the methyl groups are more flexible than on average in structured proteins.

Although they cover a smaller range than the RDCs measured in the folded domain, the N-NH and C′-NH RDC measured for PX aligned in 5% of C12E6/hexanol nevertheless present identifiable fine structure and values that are non-negligible compared with the folded domain.

SARS-CoV N protein contains three intrinsically disordered regions
In conjunction with the observation that all additional resonances are observed in between 8.3±0.5 ppm in the proton dimension and PONDR results, we conclude that aminoacids 1–44, 182–247 and 366–422 are disordered.
The spectrum of N1-181 is a superposition of well-dispersed resonances and a cluster of overlapping resonances   around 8.3±0.4 ppm (Figure 2b).

Furthermore, size exclusion chromatography of NP45-247 shows that the protein elutes out of the column with a Stokes radius corresponding to a globular protein of 41 kDa (Fig.5B). The theoretical molecular mass of the construct is 22.9 kDa, suggesting that the NP45-247 construct has an elongated shape. This is in contrast to the NTD, which is mainly globular (13). We attribute this to residues 182 to 247 forming an extraneous “tail” that affects the hydrodynamic properties of the molecule. 
Taken together, our results are compatible with previous reports from this lab where the didomain construct NP45-365 was shown to have resonances in the disordered region of the spectrum without affecting resonances belonging to either structural domain (2). We conclude that the flexible linker (residues 182 to 247) forms a bona fide ID domain not affected by either structural domain in the context of the whole protein.
Small-angle X-ray scattering data show that the protein is in an extended conformation and that the two structural domains of the SARS-CoV N protein are far apart. Both the NTD and the CTD have been shown to bind RNA. Here we show that all disordered regions are also capable of binding to RNA.
Data analysis showed that the radius of gyration of the NP45-365 dimer is 61 Å, much larger than expected for a 72-kDa globular protein ​(Fig.7B). This is consistent with the model that the NTD and CTD do not interact, and the two NTDs in the dimer are likely to float freely in solution
Second, the two N-termini (residues 248–259) protruding from the dimer core are disordered in the NMR structure, whereas, in the crystal structure, they are involved in a number of intramonomer and intradimer contacts and are more rigid (Fig. 4a). The disorder of the N-termini in solution was further supported by the analysis of backbone amide-exchange rates (data not shown). 
To identify these residues, we conducted chemical shift displacement (CSD) studies by titrating 10-mer (dT10) or 20-mer (dT20) poly-deoxythymine (poly-dT) single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) into the protein samples. ssDNA were used throughout this study as surrogates of single-stranded RNA. Titration of dT10 or dT20 into the protein sample caused a concentration-dependent gradual shift of some resonances, instead of the appearance of a new set of resonances, suggesting that the binding occurs in the fast-exchange regime, which is indicative of a low-affinity nucleic-acid-binding protein.13 For dT10, significant chemical shift changes were localized primarily in the N-terminal region, particularly K250, E253, A254, S256, K257, and K258 (Fig. 6a and b), while the majority of the other resonances were scarcely affected. This result suggests that dT10 binds to the SARS-CoV NP at the N-terminal flexible segment, without affecting the overall structure of the protein (Fig. 4). The binding constant estimated from the CSD studies at various dT10 concentrations is Kd ∼ 30 μM.

The  long  disordered  linker  between  the  two structural domains is consistent with the observation that there is little interaction between the two domains.
The two structural domains are connected by a disordered linker and capped by disordered N-terminal head and C-terminal tail.
The lack of resonance perturbation when the two domains are linked together suggests that interaction between these two domains is weak, if they interact at all. Our results conclude that SARS-CoV N protein contains two independent structural domains located at a.a. 45–181 and 248–365.
The flexible linker between the two structural domains is largely disordered. This disordered region may enable transient interactions with several structurally distinct partners. It has been shown that the M protein of SARS-CoV binds to this region between a.a. 168–208 [16]. Interestingly, human cellular hnRNP A1 has also been shown to bind to almost the same region between a.a. 161–210 [17]. The disordered state of this region potentially allows it to interact with different partners depending on context, e.g. with the M protein during virus assembly and with hnRNP A1 during host cell infection.
Flexible linker connecting the N-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD) (residues 45–181) and the C-terminal dimerization domain (residues 248–365) (DD) of SARS-CoV Nucleoprotein.
Furthermore, mutational analyses characterized that a serine/arginine-rich motif (SSRSSSRSRGNSR) between amino acids 184 and 196 is crucial for N protein oligomerization, since deletion of this region completely abolished the N protein self-multimerization.
As shown in Fig. 4C, deletion of the serine/arginine-rich region (aa 184–196) resulted in a complete loss of SEAP activities, suggesting these amino acids are required for N self-interaction. Finally, consistent with results in Fig. 2, no self-interaction was observed in the viral M proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that amino acids 184–196 are indispensable for multimerization of SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein.
Comparing the HSQC spectrum of NP45-247 with that of the NTD (NP45-181) in Fig.5A, we observed additional resonances in the spectrum of NP45-247 clustered in the 7.5- to 8.5-ppm range on the proton chemical shift. This strongly suggests that the additional residues from aa 182 to 247 of NP45-247 are disordered. 
Taken together, our results are compatible with previous reports from this lab where the didomain construct NP45-365 was shown to have resonances in the disordered region of the spectrum without affecting resonances belonging to either structural domain (2). We conclude that the flexible linker (residues 182 to 247) forms a bona fide ID domain not affected by either structural domain in the context of the whole protein.
Both the NTD and the CTD have been shown to bind RNA. Here we show that all disordered regions are also capable of binding to RNA. Constructs containing multiple RNA-binding regions showed Hill coefficients greater than 1, suggesting that the N protein binds to RNA cooperatively. The current results underscore the important roles of multisite nucleic acid binding and intrinsic disorder in N protein function and RNP packaging.
Here we tested all three disordered regions of the SARS-CoV N protein and found that they are all involved in RNA binding. The central region, in particular, had a large impact on binding behavior as monitored by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA).
Figure 3 shows that inclusion of either the first 44 residues (aa 1 to 44) or the central flexible linker (residues 182 to 247) of the SARS-CoV N protein increases the apparent binding affinity for 20-mer poly(U) ssRNA three- to fourfold over that of the NTD (residues 45 to 181) alone. Inclusion of the flexible linker not only increases the apparent affinity; it also has a large effect on the apparent Hill coefficient. Similar results are obtained when either the central flexible linker or the C-terminal 54 residues (residues 366 to 422) are included in the construct of the CTD (residues 248 to 365), as shown in ​Fig.4. The increase in apparent binding affinity is even more pronounced (six- to eightfold), probably due to the dimeric nature of the CTD, which has two attached disordered regions, whereas the NTD has one.
Taken together, a common trend is quickly apparent: inclusion of the disordered regions enhances the binding affinity of any particular construct. Of particular interest is the central flexible linker, which not only increases the binding affinity but also greatly enhances the Hill coefficients of the constructs.

Multiple constructs were designed covering different regions of ORF9a from Tor2 strain of SARS-CoV as part of the structural and functional proteomics of SARS-CoV (FSPS) project. Domain boundaries were arrived at based on secondary structure predictions, earlier observations made in the literature regarding proteolytic susceptibility, and sequence conservation characteristics.
Gel shift assay results revealed that the SARS-CoV N protein C-terminus is also able to associate with nucleic acids and residues 363-382 are the responsible interaction partner, demonstrating that this fragment might involve genomic RNA binding sites.
As shown in Figure 7, N303-422, N283-402, and N283-382 could associate with ssDNA and migrate into the gel; however, the removal of a further 20 and 40 amino acids, generating N263-362 and N243-343 (Figure 3A), caused the proteins to lose the capability of binding to ssDNA. The ability of interacting with ssDNA was restored for N343-422 (Figure 3A), as N283-422. These results thus indicated that residues 363-382 are responsible for nucleic acid binding of the SARS-CoV N protein carboxyl terminus.
Binding to DNA is used as a probe for nucleic acid binding, but the "natural" binder is RNA.
This poly-E region is inferred by the curator to be disordered, based on MobiDB-Lite and according to experimental evidence demonstrating that poly-E repeats display random-coil-like conformation (PMID:16949547)
B50/neuromodulin is a neuronal phosphoprotein that is found in association with the inner membrane of nerve cells. In this work, we have studied the structure of bovine B50 in aqueous solution (pH 7.5) by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and our results indicate that B50 is an unstructured protein under these conditions.
In agreement with a previous study (Masure et al. 1986), B50 appears to be a largely unstructured protein without any significant amount of regular secondary structure, as indicated by NMR and CD spectroscopy.
It is obvious that there is very little chemical shift dispersion in the aliphatic region of the NMR spectrum. A two-dimensional NOESY spectrum of B50 in H20 showed that no dNN(i,i+ 1) NOE cross-peaks could be observed, indicating that B50 does not have any regular α-helical structure.
In agreement with a previous study (Masure et al. 1986), B50 appears to be a largely unstructured protein without any significant amount of regular secondary structure, as indicated by NMR and CD spectroscopy.
The CD spectrum of B50 in 5 rnM Tris buffer gave a typical random coil spectrum for the protein (data not shown).
The interaction of a 14-residue peptide (I38-L51) encompassing the CaM-binding domain of B50 with CaM was also studied by NMR. We have found from two-dimensional transferred nuclear Overhauser enhancement experiments that the B50 peptide binds weakly to apo-CaM in an α-helical conformation; the α-helix appears to be induced by the binding of the peptide to apo-CaM.

We used Western blot analysis to investigate the distribution of neuromodulin and neurogranin in membrane and cytosolic extracts of adult rat brain (Fig. 1). Neuromodulin immunoreactivity was found mainly associated with the membrane fractions, but a cytosolic form of the protein also existed (Fig. 1a).

The regions flanking the well-defined core domain of BsaLΔ5, Ala10 to Gly28 at the N terminus and Ser71 to Ile84 at the C terminus, are partially ordered.
Our working hypothesis is that the intermolecular contacts between the needle molecules required for self-assembly reside within the N-terminal residues 10–25 and involves the last five residues at the C terminus of BsaL, and upon complex formation, these residues form helical structures that pack against each other.

Consistent with this finding, the CD spectrum of the C-terminal region contains a negative peak near the 200 nm region, which is representative of unfolded proteins (Fig. 3D).
 The resulting spectrum of the mix C-TcSBDS and RNA differs slightly in the 200 and 220 nm regions from the theoretical sum of the spectra from C-TcSBDS and the RNA poly-A measured separately (Fig. 7A).
A comparison of the CD spectra of the C-TcSBDS–RNA interaction with the spectrum of C-TcSBDS with 5% TFE indicates similar changes in the 200 nm region that might be due to conformation changes of C-TcSBDS following interaction with RNA.
The conformation of the C-terminal domain was also analyzed qualitatively by NMR. As shown in Fig. 5, the 15N-HSQC NMR spectrum revealed that the majority of the resonance peaks are clustered between 8.0 ppm and 8.8 ppm in the 1H dimension, and this low dispersion is characteristic of unfolded structures [21].
High susceptibility to proteolysis is also an indication of unfolded protein regions. Therefore, the recombinant full-length TcSBDS, N-TcSBDS and the C-terminal region C-TcSBDS were submitted to limited proteolysis. As expected, C-TcSBDS was readily digested by trypsin (Fig. 4).
Interestingly, we found that the interaction of TcSBDS with RNA is mediated by the C-terminal natively unfolded region (Fig. 6A, lanes 2, 3, 6, 7).
Band shifts were observed only for the EMSA performed with the RNA poly-A probe (Fig. 6B, lanes 2 and 4) both for the full-length TcSBDS and the C-terminal natively unfolded region, C-TcSBDS, indicating that TcSBDS shows higher affinity to RNA than to DNA. EMSA assays were also performed with C-TcSBDS using synthetic RNA (Fig. 6C, lanes 1, 2–5, 6) and DNA (Fig. 6C, lanes 3, 4–7, 8) sequences, which showed results similar to those obtained with the homopolymers RNA poly-A and DNA poly-A. These data indicate that TcSBDS shows a much higher affinity to RNA than to DNA.
CRKI (residues 1–204) showed well-dispersed, sharp signals, which we did not expect, given its molecular weight. Thus, CRKI was considered to have well-defined SH2 and SH3 domains that were connected by a flexible linker.

Previously crystallized GPCRs show little density for the poorly ordered amino and carboxy terminal domains. Although these domains are not critical for maintaining high ligand affinity, these flexible regions may inhibit crystallogenesis

The electron density maps were readily interpretable for madanin-1 residues M D31 to M R54 (Fig. 5a)...
Madanin-1 exhibits a novel mechanism of thrombin inhibition.
Remarkably, madanin-1 runs along the surface of thrombin in an extended conformation, with its C-terminal region blocking the active site of the enzyme, while the sulfotyrosine-containing region of the inhibitor establishes specific interactions with the exosite II of thrombin (Fig. 5a).

In addition, several of the biologically important loops displayed high atomic-mobility (B) factors and were not accurately modeled.
The region from 127 to 196 (V1-V2 loops) was not modeled.
For the bridging sheet, the flexibility in the V1/V2 stem in conjunction with a lattice contact with the second domain of CD4 results in a different orientation of the V1/V2 stem and a high overall rmsd.
The structure of the HIV gp120 envelope glycoprotein allows direct visualization of two overlapping sets of machinery. One, involved in entry, binds to both CD4 and a chemokine receptor and transmits a signal to gp41 to initiate membrane fusion. The other uses loop variation, steric occlusion, conformational change and a carbohydrate cloak to evade the immune system.
These include a single addition to the mostly disordered V4 loop (at 397) and four additional N-acetylglucosamine glycans at asparagines 88, 230, 241, and 463.
Still others, such as the V4 loop, are divergent in both sequence and structure.

The N-terminal of the sequence is missing from the pdb, even if not mention in the paper.
According to the PDB structures, the region within the boundaries is disordered.
The anti-σ factor, NepR, contains 68 amino acids; electron density for the first 29 N-terminal residues and the last 6 residues of the C terminus is not visible in our maps.
The region the authors mention corresponds to the 1-22 region of this Uniprot.
In this paper, we have shown that YdiE from E. coli has a highly similar structure, with a relatively large, unfolded N-terminal region and a C-terminal region that dimerizes through a highly hydrophobic interface.
We also assessed the secondary structure of the NPBP peptide by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, which revealed that NPBP and truncations of NPBP are intrinsically disordered in solution.
We solved the crystal structure of the VP35 NPBP/ΔNPNTD complex to 3.7 Å resolution by selenomethionine single wavelength anomalous dispersion (Se-SAD) and observed four NPBP/ΔNPNTD heterodimers in the asymmetric unit (termed molA, molB, molC, and molD for ΔNPNTD and molE, molF, molG, and molH for NPBP) (Figure 2D, Figure S3A and Table S1).
In the structure of molG/molC, NPBP interacts exclusively with the foot lobe of ΔNPNTD. NPBP forms two orthogonal helices (VP35 residues 26–36 form an alpha helix and residues 40–42 form a turn of a 310 helix) and makes multiple hydrogen bonds and non-bonded contacts with NP (Figure 3B–E).
These results revealed that VP35 residues 20–48 (i.e. NPBP) comprise the most critical region for high affinity ΔNPNTD binding (KD=18.0 ± 6.0 nM at 500 mM NaCl, Figure 2C and S2B; and KD=28.9 ± 6.4 nM at 150 mM NaCl, Figure S2C).
Further analysis of the ITC data and MALS results indicates that NPBP binds to ΔNPNTD with a 1:1 stoichiometry (Figure S2B) with a complex molecular weight corresponding to one molecule of ΔNPNTD and one molecule of NPBP (Figure S2D).

In contrast, residues 20–52 are critical for EBOV MG activity as N-terminal truncations that extend into this conserved region, including truncations such as in the 30–340 construct, resulted in >60% loss of activity relative to WT VP35 (residues 1–340). Deletion of the entire NPBP region plus the first 19 amino acids results in near-complete loss of MG activity, suggesting that the entire NPBP is required for activity.
NPBP forms two orthogonal helices (VP35 residues 26–36 form an alpha helix and residues 40–42 form a turn of a 310 helix) and makes multiple hydrogen bonds and non-bonded contacts with NP (Figure 3B–E).
In these experiments, NPBP was titrated into the reaction while ssRNA and ΔNPNTD concentrations were held constant. Increasing NPBP concentration resulted in a proportional loss of ssRNA from the ssRNA-NP complex (Figure 5D), yielding an IC50 of 4 μM. These results indicate that ssRNA and NPBP binding to NP are mutually exclusive.

ΔNPNTD binds ssRNA and the ssRNA binding is inhibited by NPBP
In contrast to previous results for the peptide-free NP proteins (Figure 1B–C), which eluted at the V0, all NPBP-bound NP proteins eluted at a volume consistent with a well-behaved heterodimer (one molecule of NP and one NPBP molecule) (Figure 6C), indicating that NPBP interaction also prevents oligomerization.
These results revealed that VP35 residues 20–48 (i.e. NPBP) comprise the most critical region for high affinity ΔNPNTD binding (KD=18.0 ± 6.0 nM at 500 mM NaCl, Figure 2C and S2B; and KD=28.9 ± 6.4 nM at 150 mM NaCl, Figure S2C).

VP35 NPBP inhibits Ebola RNA synthesis
To further test activity of NPBP in the context of EBOV infections, HeLa cells were pretransfected with the GFP-NPBP or GFP-control peptide constructs and then challenged with EBOV. Representative images of these infections show that GFP-NPBP, but not the GFP control plasmid was able to inhibit EBOV replication (Figure 7D). Consistent with the immunofluorescence results and with the MG assays, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) results show that the presence of GFP-VP35 NPBP, but not the GFP-control, results in lower viral RNA in the cell supernatants (Figure 7E). Collectively, these results suggest that NPBP can functionally interact with the NP in the viral RDRP complex and has the potential to inhibit viral RNA synthesis.
(2Fo − Fc) and (Fo − Fc) maps showed that the N-termini of CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC started at residues 71, 23, and 25, respectively, indicating that the residues 53–70 of CdtA and residues 21–24 of CdtC are disordered in the crystal structure.
The most variable region is from residue 63 to 70 (63SKNGQVSP70 vs. 63SGPNRQVLP70) (A1 in Fig. 3​3).). The N terminus of aCdtA is disordered up to residue 70 (i.e., residues 53–70 are disordered), indicating that these residues are not strongly associated with the main body.
There is no electron density for residues 57–93, indicating that
this portion (denoted loop 57–93 ) does not obey icosahedral symmetry.
The bulk of the capsid is cemented together by protein P30, and the vertex is stabilized by the integral membrane protein P16. The latter seems to act as a metastable sensor, linking the symmetry-mismatched vertex base and receptor-binding spike shaft with the membrane and providing a mechanism for the 
controlled extrusion of a membrane–protein–DNA tube to initiate host entry
analysis
The disordered loop 57–93 probably forms non-icosahedrally symmetric interactions with the vertex base, presumably explaining arms of electron density seen connecting the P16 region and capsid vertex in the cryo-EM.
Residues 51–72, which were not
resolved in the k Xis, do not show any regular structure in
HK022 Xis and thus appear to be completely disordered in
solution.
The residues from Asp51 to Ser72 are not included in any
regular structure element in HK022 Xis, as indicated by the
lack of any medium- or long-range NOEs. Hence, the
C terminus is largely disordered and displays very high local
RMSD values.

Curator statement: This entry corresponds to the bound state of Sem1 to Sac3 and Thp1. The crystal structure shows that Sem1 interacts in a mostly extended conformation, with the exception of the C-terminal helix. Several amino acids from the N-terminus and the central region do not possess electron density. 
No electron density was observed for the poorly-conserved residues (1-22) at the Sem1 N-terminus, and between the N and C-terminal binding sites (residues 42-52).
Sem1 residues 23-41 bind in a positively charged cleft formed by the TPR-like helices of the Thp1 superhelical domain (Fig. 2c,d). In this cleft, aspartates and glutamates from Sem1 form extensive ionic interactions and hydrogen bonds with several Thp1 helices (Fig 2c).
A single Sem1 chain wraps intimately around Thp1, but makes little contact with Sac3, demonstrating that Sem1 is a stoichiometric component of the TREX-2 complex. Sem1 makes extensive contacts with Thp1, burying 2741 Å2 of surface area, but makes only minor contact to Sac3, burying 293 Å2 (Supplementary Movie 2). Sem1 residues 53-89 make extensive interactions across the surface of the Thp1 superhelical domain and form a strongly conserved C-terminal helix (Supplementary Fig. 1) that binds in the cleft formed between helices α16 and α17 of the winged helix domain (Fig. 2a,b).
When expressed alone, Thp1 remained insoluble irrespective of the use of a range of solubilizing tags (Fig. 1a, lane 1), but its solubility improved dramatically when coexpressed with Sem1 (Fig. 1a, lane 2).Furthermore, Sem1 was not pulled down by Sac3 unless Thp1 was present (Fig. 1a, lanes 4 and 5), indicating that Sem1 stabilizes Thp1 and in turn facilitates formation of a stoichiometric Sac3–Thp1–Sem1 complex in vitro.
Although Sem1 has been proposed to function as the “molecular glue” that holds Sac3 and Thp1 together32, in TREX-2 Sem1 makes few contacts with Sac3 and instead appears to facilitate complex formation by stabilizing Thp1.
Yeast expressing sem1-Δ5link displayed levels of proteasomes and lid subcomplexes equivalent to cells expressing WT SEM1, and they incorporated Rpn3 into the lid and LP3 (Figure 5B). However, yeast expressing sem1-Δ11link or sem1-Δ15link had decreased levels of proteasomes compared to yeast with WT SEM1, and they did not accumulate detectable levels of LP3. Yeast expressing sem1-Δ19link were severely depleted for 26S proteasomes and free lid and had no detectable LP3 (Figure 5B)”.
The variability of the linker sequence, together with the requirement for a minimal length for efficient LP3 assembly, lead us to conclude that the linker functions primarily as a flexible spacer between Sem1 site 1 and site 2 that permits their optimal binding to Rpn3 and Rpn7
The two conserved acidic sites at opposing ends of a poorly conserved linker sequence allow Sem1 to tether Rpn3 and Rpn7 to one another until their interface can be reinforced or remodeled via docking to other lid subunits”, “Rpn3-Rpn7 tethering by Sem1 requires physical linkage between Sem1 site 1 and site 2, and the linker must be ≥10 residues in length to function normally in proteasome biogenesis (Figure 4A)
Human Rpn3 contacts Sem1 site 1 (Wei et al., 2008). The site of interaction between Rpn7 and Sem1 is poorly defined, although EM analysis suggests that Rpn7 binds the C-terminal region of Sem1 (Bohn et al., 2013). We confirmed that mutation of the eight residues of site 1 (Figure 1A) to alanines disrupted Sem1 interaction with yeast Rpn3 (Figure 3A, left panel); in contrast, this had no effect on binding to Rpn7 (Figure 3A, right panel). Conversely, mutation of the absolutely conserved Trp60 and Trp64 residues in Site 2 disrupted Sem1 binding to Rpn7 while leaving binding to Rpn3 intact (Figure 3A). These data indicate that Sem1 site 1 and site 2 contribute to independent binding sites for Rpn3 and Rpn7.
The authors use a set of Rpn3, Rpn7 and Sem1 mutants, expressed in yeast, and tag-based purifications of the macro-complex to decipher the role of Sem1 in the formation of the proteosomal lid. They demonstrate that two separate motifs, enriched in charged residues, are responsible of the interaction. As well, the length of the linker also determines the efficient tethering effect of Sem1.
The last 25 amino acids of the C-terminal extension (residues 1822–1846) are not seen in the electron density maps, and likely belong to the linker sequence connecting with the ATCase domain of CAD.
The last 25 amino acids of the C-terminal extension (residues 1822–1846) are not seen in the electron density maps, and likely belong to the linker sequence connecting with the ATCase domain of CAD.
This extension is an important structural component that fastens the bottom elements of the catalytic barrel and fixes the exit point of the linker that connects with the ATCase domain.
Loops in the vicinity of the active site cleft are disordered in the apo form of mFAS and become stabilized upon cofactor binding. This includes residues 1975 to 1990, corresponding to the β4/α4 loop in FabG, that are presumably stabilized by interactions of Met1973 with the active site Lys1995, and part of the substrate binding extension (residues 2072 to 2075)
Bound NADP+ cofactors and the attachment sites for the disordered C-terminal ACP/TE domains
The flexibly tethered ACP and the following TE domains are not visualized in the structure.
Here, we present the crystal structure of mFAS in its free and NADP+-bound states, in which the flexibly tethered C-terminal ACP/TE domains (23) remain unresolved.
Both subunits have disordered C-termini and the lack of clear density prohibits tracing the chain further, thus the proposed cleavage site for this fragment of the enzyme cannot be visualized in this structure.
Herein, we describe how limited proteolysis of the recombinant trypanosomal HPRT provided a new crystal form that yielded very high resolution X-ray diffraction data and permitted the solution of the crystal structure and refinement to 1.4 Å resolution [13]. 
 In addition to indicating that the start methionine had been removed from the recombinant enzyme, the data shows that the smaller molecular mass polypeptide observed in the SDS-PAGE was likely to be a product of cleavage by an endo-peptidase near the C-terminus of the recombinant HPRT.
The 1H,15N HSQC of NS5A-D2 (Fig. 2A) displays a narrow proton chemical shift range, limited to 1 ppm excluding three outlying peaks (Trp312, Ala313, and Arg326; see below). This low level of dispersion again points to the nonstructured nature of the polypeptide, at least when isolated in solution.
In gel filtration chromatography, the protein elutes at a volume corresponding to a ∼30-kDa globular protein, (Fig. 1B). Such a large apparent molecular weight in a gel filtration assay is commonly associated with natively unfolded proteins devoid of globular domain (52).
In aqueous buffer, NS5A-D2 gave a complex spectrum with a large negative band around 198 nm and a shoulder in the 220–240 nm range, indicating a mixture of random coil structure with the presence of some poorly defined structures.
Despite an excellent agreement between expected (11,639 Da) and experimental mass as determined by mass spectroscopy, NS5A-D2 has an apparent molecular weight of ∼18 kDa by SDS-PAGE. This discrepancy is probably due to the primary aa sequence of NS5A-D2, which includes many acidic residues and prolines (50, 51).
This abnormal behavior is observed in intrinsically disordered regions or IDPs.
To quantify the interaction strength between both partners, we titrated increasing amounts of unlabeled NS5A-D2 into samples of 15N-labeled CypA or CypB. Chemical shift changes of residues at the periphery of the binding site varied in a monotonous way from their free position toward the ligand saturated value, allowing the determination of KD values of 64 and 90 μm for CypA and CypB, respectively (Fig. 4, A–C).
Chemical shift perturbation experiments on both NS5A-D2·CypA and NS5A-D2·CypB complexes gave evidence for a direct physical interaction that is localized to the active site on the cyclophilins (Fig. 3). 
Although the molecular mass of NS5A-D3 (JFH-1) was 11,837 Da, as determined by mass spectroscopy, the purified protein migrates as a ∼27-kDa protein by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A).
This abnormal behavior is observed in intrinsically disordered regions or IDPs.
In conclusion, in aqueous buffer, NS5A-D3 (JFH-1) is mostly unfolded but has a short and stable α-helical secondary structure element centered around the N-terminal Ala367.
Both the narrow amide proton dispersion and the clustering of glycine and serine/threonine resonances confirm the non-structured nature of NS5A-D3 (JFH-1).
The CD spectrum of NS5A-D3 is typical for a poorly folded protein with a large negative peak centered at 198 nm.
 By comparison with the NS5A-D3 spectra recorded alone, we identified the residues involved in interaction with CypA based on chemical shift perturbations and/or peak broadening. Most of the perturbed resonances belong to residues in the C-terminal half of NS5A-D3 (from Ser415 to Asp461 for JFH-1 and from Ser414 to Val445 for Con1) (Fig. 1). 
Based on our previous assignment of the NS5A-D2 spectrum, we could plot on a per residue basis the ratio of the peak intensities in the absence or presence of NS5BΔ21, and as such identified three different regions of NS5A-D2 that interact with the polymerase (Fig. 1, A and C, and supplemental Fig. 5). Two peptides of roughly 10 residues form the first anchoring points (residues 250–262 (region A) and residues 274–287 (region B)). A larger zone of interaction spanning residues 306–333 forms the third zone of interaction (region C).
The 250-262 residues from NS5A protein corresponds to the 2226-2238 region of the Hepatitis C virus genotype 2a (isolate JFH-1) genome polyprotein. The binding partner, NS5BΔ21, is also encoded in the polyprotein within the residues 2464-3033

Analysis of the corresponding sensorgrams showed that the signal response at equilibrium was initially dose-dependent and then saturated, which corresponds to a specific interaction between NS5A-D2 and NS5BΔ21. The Scatchard plot of these data is linear, and thus data are consistent with the Langmuir model (see supplemental Fig. 3). The measured association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants allowed the determination of an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 21 × 10−6 m (see Fig. 2) for the interaction between NS5BΔ21 and NS5A-D2.
In agreement with our previous findings (53) and confirmed very recently with a peptide-immobilized spot assay (69), two different regions of NS5A-D2 were broadened in the presence of CypA (Fig. 1D). The first comprises residues Gly-304–Pro-323, whereas the second corresponds to residues Gly-337–Pro-341 located at the C-terminal end.
The 304-323 residues from NS5A protein corresponds to the 2280-2299 region of the Hepatitis C virus genotype 2a (isolate JFH-1) genome polyprotein.

From NMR spectroscopic data and simulated annealing, the soluble nonmyristoylated p14 ectodomain peptide consists of an N-proximal extended loop flanked by two proline hinges. The remaining two-thirds of the ectodomain peptide structure is disordered, consistent with predictions based on CD spectra of the myristoylated peptide
The C-terminal disordered region (residues 15–31) may act as a flexible linker, facilitating conformational changes in either the structure or spatial arrangement of the p14 HP, similar to the proposed role of the
linker region that connects the influenza HA fusion peptide to the remainder of the HA2 polypeptide 
Solution NMR spectroscopy was used to provide additional insight into why residues clustered near the central portion of the p14 HP exert a sequence-specific effect on p14 fusion activity, while at the same time CD analysis predicts the p14 ectodomain is mostly disordered
Circular dichroism (CD) of a myristoylated peptide representing the majority of the p14 ectodomain suggested this region is mostly disordered in solution but assumes increased structure in an apolar environment
The inherent structural plasticity of many fusion peptides is likely essential for their role as membrane destabilizing modules. We propose that the p14 HP is no exception, requiring a dynamic structure in addition to a potential membrane-embedding loop in order to achieve maximal function as a membrane-
destabilizing module.
However, the absence of a single main chain conformation of the C-terminal part inthe structure of Se-Met-EntA-im-(L31M+L80M) and that of molecule B points to a flexible C terminus.
The latter interactions define the conformation of a long loop (segment 22–32), which is completely solvent-exposed and rich in charged residues.
The segment 22-32 is corresponding to 41-51 in UniProt.
The R68X mutant (Arg68Stop) is a peptide of 67 amino acids from the N terminus of stefin B. CD spectra have shown that the R68X peptide is not folded, in contrast to the G4R mutant, which folds like wild type.
Far-UV CD spectra (Fig. 1A) for the wt stefin B and the G4R mutant are very similar; both proteins give characteristic CD spectra for α/β secondary structure with minima at 222 nm, while the R68X mutant gives a CD spectrum characteristic of unfolded proteins with a minimum at 200 nm and low ellipticity in the 210–230 nm region.
The R68X mutant showed a very high tendency to fibrillate (Fig. 8 [triangle]). Fibrils formed in 1 h without the addition of TFE (Fig. 8A1,A2 [triangle]). However, these fibrils were shorter from those grown in the presence of TFE, as judged from TEM images (Fig. 8B1,B2,C [triangle]).
For the R68X mutant, in the absence of TFE and in 3% TFE, fibril formation was very much faster (Fig. 6). No distinct lag phase could be observed, and in a few hours the whole reaction reached the plateau phase.
The first 20 amino acids in the N-terminal side are not included in the atomic model because the region projects outwards, and its density vanishes due to high flexibility.
As expected, many peaks in the NOE spectrum of LMP2A NTD were negative, indicating an overall flexible structure.
Indeed, the chemical shift dispersion was limited to a mere 1.2 ppm, which immediately confirmed the macroscopic unfolded nature of the protein. Fortunately, the resolution of each peak and the peak dispersion along the nitrogen axis (about 25 ppm) were sufficient to achieve the peak assignment. As expected, the overall chemical shifts of the LMP2A NTD are similar to those of a random-coil structure, and the CSI results also showed that the LMP2A NTD adopts a random-coil structure in its native state.
Upon the binding of the WW2 peptide, six residues (Tyr60, Glu61, Asp62, Trp65, Gly66, and Asn67) just behind the N-terminal PY motif and nine residues (Leu84, Tyr85, Leu86, Gly87, Gln89, His90, Asp94, Gly95, and Leu96) preceding to the C-terminal PY motif of the LMP2A NTD completely disappeared, which means that these residues are directly involved in WW2 domain binding.
To analyze the binding of the WW2 and WW3 peptides to the LMP2A NTD, 200 μM aliquots of chemically synthesized WW2 and WW3 peptides (WW2 and WW3 domains of human Nedd4-like ubiquitin-protein ligases AIP4) were each added to 100 μM of the LMP2A NTD, and the chemical shift changes of the LMP2A NTD were monitored in HSQC spectra (WW2:Ac-PLPPGWERRVDNMGRIYYVDHFTRTTTWQRPTLE-NH2 WW3:Ac-GPLPPGWEKRTDSNGRVYFVNHNTRITQWEDPRS-NH2).

Upon WW3 peptide binding, the resonances of five residues (Tyr60, Glu61, Asp62, Trp65, and Gly66) just behind the N-terminal PY motif of the LMP2A NTD disappeared, a similar situation as with WW2 binding.

Upon WW3 peptide binding, the resonances of three residues (Leu86, Gly87, and Asp94) in region 9 completely disappeared, and the resonances of three residues (Ser108, Gln109, and His110) in region 10 showed chemical shift changes.

The LMP2A NTD-WW3 peptide complex.
Like the WW2 peptide, the WW3 peptide forms a complex with the LMP2A NTD, although the number of residues showing chemical shift changes was relatively smaller than that of the WW2 peptide (Fig. 3b).

Therefore, the structure of LMP2A NTD seems to be intrinsically unordered without any regular structures.
Following the secondary structure numbering of homologous proteins (10), the latter unstructured stretch reads Tyr927–Gly945
The flexible character of the unstructured segment Tyr927–Gly945, suggested by the sharpness of the corresponding NMR signals, was confirmed by 15N{1H} NOE measurements, which exhibited local enhancements ranging between -90 and -110%, as opposed to an average value of -15% observed for all the other residues but the N- and C-terminal ones (not shown).
The region Tyr927–Gly945 was classified as flexible and disordered in every analysis performed, according to 15N{1H} NOE evidence.
The published residue boundaries needed to be shifted by +21 to confirm to the current UniProt sequence.
The different point-mutated proteins and the shortest deletion mutant del(Leu932–Gly945) were then assayed in standard cell adhesion assays. Jurkat cells that express high levels of the α4β1 integrin attached in a dose-response assay very efficiently to wild type and mutated EMILIN1 gC1q except del(Gly932–Gly945), E933A, L932A/E933A, and wild type EMILIN1 gC1q denatured in 8 m urea.

Thus, amino acid substitution mutants revealed that the conserved residue Glu933 is essential for binding of EMILIN1 gC1q to integrin α4β1, whereas single mutations of several residues close to Glu933, do not affect the interaction between the two molecules.
Because static adhesion and haptotaxis experiments showed that cells are highly dependent on Glu933 for full functionality, we next mimicked cell flow in blood vessels to determine whether firm arrest of Jurkat T cells mediated by α4β1 was also related to residue Glu933. Under flow conditions at a shear rate of 20 s-1 almost no Jurkat cells had arrested on E933A-gC1q-coated surfaces up to 4 min of flow. In marked contrast up to 160 cells/mm2 were firmly arrested on coated wt gC1q-coated surfaces.

One difficulty encountered with the resonance assignment of gC1q arose from the identification of residues belonging to the segment Tyr927-Gly945, which contains four proline residues. Detection and recognition of resonances for this proved difficult due to a relatively poor signal-to-noise ratio of the nitrogen correlation spectra and was only accomplished when the majority of other peaks had already been classified. Line broadening due to slow conformational averaging of this region of EMILIN1 gC1q could be a reason for the lack of detectable amide resonances. Noticeably, this segment has very low sequence homology with other proteins of the family because it includes part of a 12-residue insertion (from Ser940 to Ser951) that is unique to EMILIN1 and EMILIN2 gC1q domains. Two amino acids in the segment 927–945, i.e. Asn934 and Ser940, still have unassigned HN groups and nine amino acids have typical 1H and 15N random coil chemical shifts
The published residue boundaries needed to be shifted by +21 to confirm to the current UniProt sequence.
According to our data the secondary structure of the EMILIN1 gC1q domain is composed of nine β-strands and one unstructured region including residues 927–945.
15N{1H} NOE measurements were run at 11.4 T and 310 K, using two different relaxation/saturation delays, 3 and 5 s. As seen from the histogram in Fig. 4, the results indicate that, besides the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, the highest mobility is observed at segment 927–945.
Some residues belong to portions of the polypeptide chain with high mobility, according to 15 N{1H} NOE data (Fig. 4), i.e. the C-terminal segment including residues Glu991-Ala995, Val949, Ala958 and the unstructured region previously identified in fragment Tyr927-Gly945. This supports the hypothesis of the existence of a flexible loop (927–945) and a five-residue C-terminal segment that are separate from the main protein fold. It is worth noting that the segment Tyr927-Gly945 and the C-terminal pentapeptide showed typical random-coil chemical shifts and no TALOS prediction output nor slow-exchanging amide protons were available or detected for those amino acids.
The narrow range of amide proton chemical shifts observed in a 1H/15N HSQC spectra of the two proteins (Figure S5A) confirmed that they are intrinsically disordered.
Here, we demonstrate that human Ddx4 and its isolated disordered N terminus spontaneously self-associate both in cells and in vitro into structures that are indistinguishable from the cellular Ddx4-organelles.
Here, we demonstrate that human Ddx4 and its isolated disordered N terminus spontaneously self-associate both in cells and in vitro into structures that are indistinguishable from the cellular Ddx4-organelles.
The organelles are clearly partitioned from surrounding nuclear structures including chromatin domains and other native nuclear bodies (Figures 1C and S2B), a finding consistent with the liquid droplet-like nature suggested by FRAP measurements (Figure 2A).
These data reveal that the disordered termini of Ddx4 mediate self-organization into macroscopic fluxional spherical structures in live cells that can be classified as organelles, which can respond rapidly to changes in the cellular environment.

We show that the ANC1 homology domain (AHD) of AF9, one of the most common MLL translocation partners, is intrinsically disordered and recruits multiple transcription factors through coupled folding and binding.
15N-1H HSQC spectra showed extreme broadening, with only a small number of peaks with narrow 1H chemical shift dispersion and an insufficient number of peaks for the amino acids in the domain (Figure 1a). Since the interacting regions between AF4 and AF9 had been finely mapped (Srinivasan et al., 2004), we titrated a peptide derived from the AF9 interaction motif of AF4 (residues 761 to 774) into the AF9 AHD. This resulted in dramatically improved chemical shift dispersion and an increased number of observable peaks in the HSQC spectrum (Figure 1b).
These data show that the AF9 AHD is intrinsically disordered, and recruits AF4 through mutual synergistic folding (Demarest et al., 2002).
Leukemia fusion target AF9 is an intrinsically disordered transcriptional regulator that recruits multiple partners via coupled folding and binding.
We show that the ANC1 homology domain (AHD) of AF9, one of the most common MLL translocation partners, is intrinsically disordered and recruits multiple transcription factors through coupled folding and binding.
We propose that AF9 functions as a signaling hub that regulates transcription through dynamic recruitment of cofactors in normal hematopoiesis and in acute leukemia.
In addition to AF4 family members, the AF9 AHD has previously been shown to interact with hPC3, BCoR and Dot1L. Having established that AF4 and AF9 interact through mutual synergistic folding, we hypothesized that other binding partners may interact with AF9 in a similar manner.
In order to investigate the other interactions with the AF9 AHD, we cloned DNA coding for the sequences derived from hPC3, Dot1L and BCoR into our coexpression vector and found that all of these co-purified with AF9. Using triple resonance based backbone assignments and 1H 15N heteronuclear NOE experiments, we were able to map the residues of these proteins involved in the interaction with the AF9 AHD. Immediately apparent is the similarity in the chemical shifts of the AF9 NH moieties observed in the HSQC spectra of these complexes. As chemical shifts are highly sensitive to structure, this similarity indicates that AF9 retains a similar fold in all of the complexes (Figure 3a-d).
Together, these data strongly suggest that AF9 retains a similar fold in each of the complexes, and that each of its binding partners share a common binding site on AF9. This is consistent with previous data showing that AF9 binding partners interact with the AF9 AHD in a mutually exclusive manner (Srinivasan et al., 2003; Yokoyama et al., 2010). It was previously proposed that where IDPs compete for binding to a common site, coupled folding and binding may allow one IDP to displace another without its prior dissociation, facilitating rapid exchange between high affinity partners (De Guzman et al., 2004). The differing functions of the AF9 binding partners suggest that the function of the AHD may be to regulate gene expression through alternate binding to its partners, and intrinsic disorder may facilitate their exchange as a function of local concentration and affinity.
The AHD recruits AF4, BCoR, Dot1L and hPC3 by coupled folding and binding
AF9 binding partners compete for binding to a common site
15N-1H HSQC spectra showed extreme broadening, with only a small number of peaks with narrow 1H chemical shift dispersion and an insufficient number of peaks for the amino acids in the domain (Figure 1a). Since the interacting regions between AF4 and AF9 had been finely mapped (Srinivasan et al., 2004), we titrated a peptide derived from the AF9 interaction motif of AF4 (residues 761 to 774) into the AF9 AHD. This resulted in dramatically improved chemical shift dispersion and an increased number of observable peaks in the HSQC spectrum (Figure 1b).
These data show that the AF9 AHD is intrinsically disordered, and recruits AF4 through mutual synergistic folding (Demarest et al., 2002).
Leukemia fusion target AF9 is an intrinsically disordered transcriptional regulator that recruits multiple partners via coupled folding and binding.
We show that the ANC1 homology domain (AHD) of AF9, one of the most common MLL translocation partners, is intrinsically disordered and recruits multiple transcription factors through coupled folding and binding.
We propose that AF9 functions as a signaling hub that regulates transcription through dynamic recruitment of cofactors in normal hematopoiesis and in acute leukemia.
In addition to AF4 family members, the AF9 AHD has previously been shown to interact with hPC3, BCoR and Dot1L. Having established that AF4 and AF9 interact through mutual synergistic folding, we hypothesized that other binding partners may interact with AF9 in a similar manner.
In order to investigate the other interactions with the AF9 AHD, we cloned DNA coding for the sequences derived from hPC3, Dot1L and BCoR into our coexpression vector and found that all of these co-purified with AF9.

As chemical shifts are highly sensitive to structure, this similarity indicates that AF9 retains a similar fold in all of the complexes (Figure 3a-d).

We show that the ANC1 homology domain (AHD) of AF9, one of the most common MLL translocation partners, is intrinsically disordered and recruits multiple transcription factors through coupled folding and binding.
In order to understand the structural changes induced by peptide binding, we conducted circular dichroism (CD) experiments on the AF9 AHD alone and in complex with the AF4 peptide. Surprisingly, these showed that in isolation the AHD is almost entirely random coil with only a small amount of beta structure predicted using K2D (Andrade et al., 1993)(Figure 1c). Upon addition of the AF4 peptide, the domain undergoes a structural rearrangement to form a mixed alpha-beta structure consistent with the dramatic change in the HSQC spectrum (Figure 1b).
These data show that the AF9 AHD is intrinsically disordered, and recruits AF4 through mutual synergistic folding (Demarest et al., 2002).

We expressed the C-terminal 79 amino acids of AF9, which includes the minimal portion of AF9 required for oncogenic activity of an MLL-AF9 fusion protein in colony forming assays (Prasad et al., 1995) and roughly corresponds to the minimal domain observed in a clinical case of leukemia with an MLL-AF9 translocation (Mitterbauer et al., 1999). During initial efforts to express and purify the AHD, we found that it had limited solubility and that the domain was prone to proteolytic degradation.
Recombinant protein overexpressed and purified from E. coli displayed an ellipticity minimum at 200nm and a value near zero at 220nm in physiological buffers, which supports an overall disordered structure.
CDeT11-24 protein extracted from plant cells showed a CD spectrum similar to the spectrum of recombinant protein (Fig. 1C), indicating that there was no significant difference between native and recombinant proteins with regard to this property.
The CDeT11-24 protein remained soluble in heat-treated protein extracts of dried C. plantagineum tissues (Fig. 1A).
In the presence of recombinant CDeT11-24 proteins, CS activity remained at more than 80% for 6His-CDeT11-24 and at 70% for CDeT11-24, even after three cycles of dehydration and rehydration. The protective effect slightly exceeded the effect caused by the disaccharide trehalose, which was used as a reference (Crowe et al., 2001).
Lipid-binding assays revealed that CDeT11-24 is able to interact with phosphatidic acid, although electrostatic repulsion was expected due to the overall negative net charge of the protein under the tested physiological conditions.
Analysis of the truncated CDeT11-24 protein identified this region to be responsible for both activities: enzyme protection and phosphatidic acid interaction.
However, CDeT11-24 bound to the phospholipid monoester PA. Weak binding was also observed with cardiolipin, which is a phospholipid containing two phosphodiester groups.

In line with data in the literature concerning other Tat variants, the CD spectra demonstrated the absence of any significant ordered secondary structure for these proteins, as seen from the intensive minimum at 198 nm and an ellipticity close to zero in the vicinity of 185 and 222 nm (see Fig. 2).
Altogether, these results indicate that both wt-Tat133 and STLA-Tat133 can undergo an induced but limited folding toward α-helix conformation on binding to specific Fab′, 14C12B5 and 11H6H1.
 As expected, the CD spectrum of wt-Tat133 alone or in the presence of 6M urea was characteristic of a fully unfolded protein.
Thus, the Stokes radii measured by DLS and gel filtration for Tat proteins are not compatible with a globular protein, but with a disordered state.
The hydrodynamic radii measured for wt-Tat133 and STLA-Tat133 by DLS analysis at a concentration of 1 mg/mL were RS = 30 ± 3 Å (data not shown), which is coherent with a fully unfolded protein.
For wt-Tat133, this ratio Rg/Rs is between 1.1 and 1.4 depending if we use the Rs value measured by DLS or gel filtration, respectively, and is thus coherent with a fully unfolded protein.
In the case of wt-Tat133, the Kratky plot is typical of a fully unfolded protein without significant residual structure [Fig. 4(B)].
Thus, the Stokes radii measured by DLS and gel filtration for Tat proteins are not compatible with a globular protein, but with a disordered state.
An α-helix transition was observed for the wt-Tat133/14C12B5 Fab′ complexes, as indicated by the more pronounced minimum between 210 and 220 nm and by the shifting of the maximum toward 195 nm of the experimentally observed spectrum compared with the corresponding theoretical average curve [Fig. 7(A)].
As shown in Figure 6(B), the emission spectra of WT-Tat in water or in 6M urea are identical, with a maximal emission wavelength at ∼347 nm characteristic of a tryptophan in an aqueous environment,63 confirming that the region around Trp11 is natively unfolded.
Our fluorescence emission experiments showed that the peak of fluorescence of Tat alone at ∼347 nm is close to the location of the peak of a fully accessible tryptophan.63 Moreover, the fluorescence did not display any shift when Tat was placed in a denaturing environment (6M urea). This confirms that Tat is natively unfolded and suggests that, in the native conformation of Tat, the only tryptophan of Tat (Trp11) is not involved in a putative hydrophobic pocket contrarily to what has been suggested by others studies.
The first helix (H1) of the bundle is joined to the second helix (H2) through a disordered fourteen-residue loop.
The function of the disordered loop cannot be inferred from the experiments; however, deleting the loop and at least one adjacent helix abolished binding to the human CD36 receptor. The length of the loop is variable between various homologoues.
The X-ray crystal structure of the intact human Max protein homodimer in complex with a 13-mer DNA duplex was determined to 2.8 A resolution and refined to an R factor of 0.213. The C-terminal domains in both chains of the Max dimer are disordered.
The C-terminal domains in both chains of the Max dimer are disordered.
The disorder observed in the C-terminal domain suggests that contacts with additional protein components of the transcription machinery are necessary for ordering the secondary structure.
Although p21 Max is present in the crystals in its entirety, together with the 13 base pair duplex of DNA, in our crystals a large part of the C terminus is disordered. The present model includes residues 3–82 and 10–82 in monomers A and B, respectively.
Finally, regarding the C-terminal domain comprising residues 93–150, this entire region is disordered in the Max structure reported here.
The C-terminal domain following the leucine zipper is disordered in the crystal structure, suggesting that it is intrinsically flexible and that other components of the transcriptional machinery may be required for secondary structure formation.
Again tau is clearly different from a globular protein (Fig. 3b, bottom), it has the characteristics of a denatured protein.
Soluble proteins K19, K18-ΔK280, and full-length htau40-ΔK280 exhibit FTIR maxima around 1645−1646 cm-1, consistent with the CD experiments and the dominance of the random coil conformation [Figure 6A−C (dashed lines)].
The CD spectra change when tau is induced to aggregate into PHFs. Figure 4A−C (solid lines) shows the PHF spectra after separation from soluble tau by a clearing spin. For three-repeat construct K19, the minimum shifts toward a higher wavelength, indicating a transition to a higher β-sheet content (Figure 4A). This change is even more pronounced for the FTDP-17 mutant of four-repeat construct K18 (K18-ΔK280, Figure 4B), consistent with the strong tendency of this mutant to form PHFs due to an increased propensity for β-sheet formation (20, 23).
Upon PHF polymerization, the spectra of the repeat constructs shift the maximum to ∼1629 and 1626 cm-1 [Figure 6A,B (solid lines)], indicating a shift toward a high β-structure content (55, 56).
In all cases, the filaments were mainly of the paired helical type, had a typical length of 100−500 nm, were 10−25 nm wide, and had a crossover repeat of ∼80 nm (Figure 2, top panel). Thus, they showed all characteristics of “Alzheimer PHFs” (39, 40).
In a Western blot analysis, the samples were probed with the polyclonal antibody K9JA that recognizes the repeat region and the C-terminus of tau. The pattern was comparable to that of the Coomassie-stained gel with regard to the three- to four-band pattern and the high- and low-Mr smear, showing that most of the protein (∼75% as measured by densitometric methods) in the Alzheimer PHF preparations was indeed tau (Figure 3B).
In the SDS gel, the three individual Alzheimer PHFs all exhibited the typical three- to four-band appearance [bands at 55, 64, and 69 kDa and a minor fourth band (72−74 kDa) which contain the six human tau isoforms in a highly phosphorylated form (43−45)] (Figure 3A).
Tau can be boiled and dissolved in dilute acids, and yet it does not lose its microtubule-assembly promoting activity (Fellous et al., 1977); this argues that overall chain folding is not very important for the interaction of tau with microtubules (although other less obvious functions may be affected by this treatment).

Additional evidence for the apparent "denatured" state of tau comes from absorption spectroscopy (data not  shown). 
Tau is difficult to visualize in the electron microscope because of its low contrast (Zingsheim et al., 1979), but the glycerol-spray technique reveals the structure of an elongated and flexible rod, about 35 nm in length (Fig. 2, Wille et al. (1992)).
Fig. 6, a and b, shows the wide and small angle pattern of pelleted microtubules. These structures can be oriented quite well by either of the above methods, but here we have chosen an example of rather poor orientation in order to facilitate the comparison with the PHF  pattern below (for an example of good orientation and its interpretation see Mandelkow et al. (1977) and Mandelkow (1986)).
The amide I maxima between 1600 and 1700 cm" arise from stretch vibrations of the amide carbonyl groups and vary depending on how the carbonyls are hydrogen bonded. Thus absorption maxima between 1617 and 1634 cm" are characteristic for β-sheets while α-helices, turns, or random coils have maxima between 1645 and 1663 cm" (Susi  and Byler,  1986).
All curves obtained for hτ23 show a minimum of around 200 nm, characteristic of largely random coil structures, which confirms our earlier observations (25).
All the profiles are featureless, and the Kratky plots [s2I(s) vs s] are without apparent peaks (Supporting Information Figure 3), which is typical for unfolded proteins.
Table 1 indicates that the larger constructs (ht23 and ht40) have Rg values close to or smaller than the predicted random coil values, which are shown by ref 29 to agree well with the experimental data from chemically unfolded proteins (note that as tau constructs are not denatured using chemicals the random coil estimations cannot be considered ideal predictions, but they do provide a useful guidance).
For full length constructs (ht40 and ht23), little difference from the pool distribution was observed (typical models of ht40 selected from the random pools are displayed in Figure 4 to demonstrate that the protein is indeed rather unstructured).
NMR assignment of an intrinsically disordered protein under physiological conditions: the 18.5 kDa isoform of murine myelin basic protein
The high degree of spin system overlap and chemical shift degeneracy inherent to intrinsically disordered proteins hinders resonance assignment. The 1H, 15N, and 13C backbone assignments were over 93% complete, excluding the carbonyl carbons, and residues Q3, L27, V91, and T92 for which no sequential crosspeaks were observed. Further, no resonances could be assigned for P96 and P97, which were part of a proline-rich domain.
Notably, an amphipathic α-helix (V83-T92) present in the protein under membrane-mimetic conditions appears disordered under these solution conditions.
The lack of stable Kapβ2•FUS contacts outside the PY-NLS is consistent with observations that only the PY-NLS is observed in crystal structures of Kapβ2 bound to FUS (full-length), FUS(371–526) and FUS(456–526)
The RNA-binding protein Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) undergoes LLPS in vitro and associates with condensates in cells. We show that the Importin Karyopherin-β2/Transportin-1 inhibits LLPS of FUS. This activity depends on tight binding of Karyopherin-β2 to the C-terminal proline-tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) of FUS.
Kapβ2 inhibits FUS turbidity and phase separation in a PY-NLS- and RanGTP-dependent manner
The largest perturbations are observed for resonances from the segments 37SYSGY41, 97YPGY100 and 149YSPPSG154, suggesting relatively stronger binding to these elements
Amide resonances change similarly upon addition of Kapβ2 alone or Kapβ2•PY-NLS, indicating contacts outside the PY-NLS binding site of the karyopherin
Kapβ2 inhibits FUS turbidity and phase separation in a PY-NLS- and RanGTP-dependent manner
NMR analyses reveal multiple weak interactions of Kapβ2 with both folded and disordered regions across FUS.

Phase-Transition of the LC Sequence Domain of FUS into a Hydrogel
By contrast, N-terminal truncations lacking the LC sequence were incapable of phase transitioning into a hydrogel-like state.
Full-length FUS also undergoes LLPS, but at much lower concentrations, consistent with previous reports that the RGG regions can contribute to self-association of the protein
The 1H/15N HSQC spectrum of 17 μM 15N-FUS(164–500) shows many strong resonances with 1H chemical shifts between ~7.5 ppm and 8.5 ppm, mostly representing residues in unstructured regions of the protein, as well as numerous resonances outside of this window, which represent the folded RRM (residues 285–370) and Cys4-type ZnF (residues 421–455) domains.

Removal of MBP from MBP-FUS with the Tev protease causes FUS to self-associate, producing a turbid solution (Figure 1B and S1D, E).
The lack of significant deviation between the observed shifts and those of a random coil reference demonstrate that the monomeric FUS LC domain is highly disordered, lacking significant population of α helices or β sheets (Figure S1A).
These data support our conclusion that the domain is predominantly disordered.
Because NMR chemical shifts are sensitive reporters of structure, we conclude that the LC domain retains the same disordered structure in the monomeric full-length protein as in the isolated FUS LC domain.
While measuring the structural properties of the monomeric FUS LC, we noticed that our solutions of FUS turned opalescent or cloudy when placed on ice.
Upon release of MBP by TEV cleavage leaving the native protein, samples as low as 1 μM full-length FUS assemble into an opalescent, phase-separated liquid (Figure 2B) resembling that formed by FUS LC. Phase separation proceeds rapidly after addition of TEV, and the extent of phase-separation is greater at higher concentrations of full-length FUS (Figure S2A).
We used differential interference contrast microscopy to visualize the formation of liquid phase-separated FUS LC (Figure 2A), which resemble FUS-containing RNP granules previously observed in cells (Bentmann et al., 2012).
While working with concentrated forms of the recombinant, full length FUS protein linked to a GST tag (∼10mg/ml), it was noted that the protein adopted a gel-like state when stored at low temperature.
When produced as chimeric proteins with GST, mCherry or GFP, the FUS LC domain (residues 2-214, ∼50mg/ml) yielded clear, red and green colored hydrogels respectively (Figure 3A).
To initiate morphological and structural studies of the nature of the mCherry:FUS LC hydrogel, we first gathered transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of a pre-formed hydrogel composed of either mCherry:FUS LC or a His6-tag version of the FUS LC domain (Figure 5A and 5B). Both the mCherry:FUS and His:FUS preparations revealed morphologically uniform amyloid-like fibers.
When produced as chimeric proteins with GST, mCherry or GFP, the FUS LC domain (residues 2-214, ∼50mg/ml) yielded clear, red and green colored hydrogels respectively (Figure 3A).
Whereas the control, YFP alone, was localized diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus, FUS-YFP localized to the cytoplasm where it formed numerous foci (Figure 1C).
However, FUS expression induced the formation of P-bodies and stress granules and FUS-YFP colocalized with both of these structures (Figure 2A,B).
Upon addition of TEV protease, FUS aggregated extremely rapidly (Figure 5C). By contrast, GST-FUS remained predominantly soluble (Figure 5C). Under identical conditions neither GST nor TEV protease aggregated (Figure 5C).
Adding back the first RGG domain (amino acids 371–422) was sufficient to restore cytoplasmic aggregation (Figure 3B, construct 1–422).
We also noticed that FUS formed small foci in the nucleoplasm (Figure 1B).
The spatiotemporal analysis of such half-bleach events showed that FUS was redistributed rapidly within stress granules and nuclear FUS assemblies, from the unbleached area to the bleached area (Figures 2A and 2B; Figure S2A; Movie S2). Thus, we conclude that FUS molecules can diffuse freely in stress granules and nuclear assemblies, in agreement with a liquid material state.
Therefore, FUS assemblies have all the hallmarks of a liquid state: they turn over quickly; are spherical; and when they fuse, they relax into one spherical assembly (Hyman et al., 2014). Taken together, these experiments show that FUS assemblies are liquid droplets, which probably form by liquid-liquid demixing in the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm.
Despite the repetitive nature of the FUS-LC sequence, we find that the structured core of FUS-LC fibrils is formed reproducibly by a specific 57-residue segment in the N-terminal half. Other segments, especially in the C-terminal half, remain dynamically disordered.

We therefore conclude that residues 39–95 constitute the structurally ordered core of FUS-LC fibrils, with partial disorder or enhanced dynamics in residues 55–62 that precludes detection or unambiguous assignment of solid state NMR signals to these sites.
A large negative minimum at 200 nm in the far-UV CD spectrum (Figure 1C) together with a linearly increasing Kratky plot obtained by SAXS (Figure 1D) collectively suggested that PRLR-ICDFL,His was highly disordered with a low content of secondary structure.

content of secondary structure.
Furthermore, the 1 H-15N-HSQC spectrum of PRLR-ICDFL,His obtained by NMR spectroscopy (Figure 1E) showed low dispersion of signals in the proton dimension, characteristic of IDPs [39] and similar to data obtained for gp130 [10].
NMR diffusion experiments were applied to measure the hydrodynamic radius (RH) of hPRLR-ICD to 74 Å±1 Å.
First, lipid-binding specificity was assessed using lipid strips pre-dotted with different phospholipids and PRLR-ICDmp specifically recognized only negatively charged phospholipids [phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and
phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs)] (Supplementary Figure S2). These lipids are hallmarks of the inner plasma membrane leaflet [46] and, importantly, PRLR-ICDmp did not recognize phosphatidylcholine (PC; Supplementary Figure S2), which is an outer leaflet constituent [46].
As seen from Figure 2(C), addition of POPC/POPS SUV to the PRLRICDFL resulted in chemical shift changes in all three identified LIDs and thus confirmed the results obtained using the truncated variants. Moreover, since the chemical shift changes of the resolved residues of the truncated and full-length PRLR-ICD variants were similar, each LID of the PRLR-ICD appeared to associate with the lipids independently most probably due to the long disordered regions separating them.
Large confined chemical shift changes were observed for residues Glu245–His300 and the majority of signals from Gly236–Phe244 disappeared as a result of binding, thus identifying a LID1 comprising residues Gly236– His300 (Figure 2B). The chemical shifts of residues Phe350– His383 were also affected by the presence of POPC/POPS SUVs thereby defining a second LID, LID2 (Figure 2B).

Following the same strategy as for PRLR-ICDmp, POPS specificity was observed for PRLR-ICDmd using 31P-NMR (Figure 2A) and chemical shift changes obtained from 1 H-15NHSQC spectra identified an additional LID3 in PRLR-ICDmd comprising residues Cys547-His598 (Figure 2B).

Using in vitro kinase assays, we investigated whether incubation with these active kinases could phosphorylate PRLR-ICDmp and showed that Lyn, Fyn and c-Src resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation (Figure 5A, lanes 3–5), whereas Jak2 and Fgr
did not (Figure 5A, lanes 2 and 6).
By reassigning the phosphorylated state, phosphorylation-induced chemical shift changes were seen to locate to residues Thr280– Tyr290 and most pronounced around residues Thr280–Glu284, thereby strongly indicating Tyr283 to be phosphorylated by Fyn.
Furthermore, the fact that the LLPS of this intrinsically disordered domain is controlled by just a few residues may explain the unusual droplet form of TDP-43 (9).
The HSQC showed in the article is a typical IDP spectra, but it was taken for granted and not specified.
We also collected time-lapse micrographs from low to high and then back to low temperatures to confirm the reversibility of the process (Fig. 2C, and supporting Movie S1).
At 5 °C and a protein concentration of 20 μm, clear evidence of LLPS was only observed for the WT sample (Fig. 3A).
We measured the turbidity of the WT sample (the optical density at 600 nm, OD600 nm, Fig. 2A) and recorded micrographs of the condensates at different static temperatures (Fig. 2B) to confirm the occurrence of LLPS.
At 5 °C and a protein concentration of 20 μm, clear evidence of LLPS was only observed for the WT sample (Fig. 3A).
The two dimensional NMR spectrum of the TDP-43 C-terminal domain serves as a fingerprint of protein structure, with a narrow range of 1H chemical shifts consistent with predominant disorder (Figure 1A).
For the majority of the domain, the difference between the observed Cα and Cβ chemical shift values and those predicted for an entirely disordered protein, δΔCα-δΔCβ, do not exceed ±0.75 ppm, consistent with intrinsic disorder.
The narrow assigned 1H-15N HSQC of TDP-43267–414 suggests the domain is primarily intrinsically disordered.
However, upon addition of 150 mM NaCl, the domain rapidly undergoes LLPS (Figure 3A top). These assemblies appear as dynamic, high protein concentration liquid droplets that flow and fuse and show effectively complete fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), highlighting their liquid-like character (Figure 3C and Movie S1).

The extent of phase separation increases with increasing salt concentration as monitored by turbidity.
Interestingly, both removal of the region harboring the α-helical structure and these mutations (Δ321–343) as well as introduction of the helix-breaking A326P resulted in loss of phase separation, suggesting that the helical region is important for LLPS. 
The TDP-43266–414 variants undergo LLPS at different temperatures and have different NMR signal intensity profiles.
We observed that wild-type TDP-43266–414 showed reversible LLPS when we lowered the temperature (Fig. 2 a and b; all samples returned to the original transparency either from observing the microscope image or from its turbidity).

We observed that wild-type TDP-43266–414 showed reversible LLPS when we lowered the temperature (Fig. 2 a and b; all samples returned to the original transparency either from observing the microscope image or from its turbidity).
We found that TDP-43266–414 turned into hydrogel even in 8 M urea when the protein concentration is high (above 500 μM).
As judged by its far-ultraviolet (UV) CD spectrum with the maximal negative signal at 199 nm and no positive signal at 190 nm (Fig 1B), it appears to be highly disordered without any stable secondary structure.
Moreover, it has a 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy (HSQC) spectrum with very narrow 1H (0.86 ppm) and 15N (17.84 ppm) spectral dispersions in which three Trp residues have their sidechain HSQC peaks largely overlapped (Fig 1C). These observations indicate that it also has no tight tertiary packing.
Interestingly, the sample, even at a concentration of 20 μM, started to self-associate in pH 6.8 buffer, as monitored by CD (Fig 1B). After 1 d, the CD signal intensity showed a slight reduction, while after 4 d, the CD spectrum changed dramatically which is similar to what have been observed on the soluble β-stranded oligomers formed by the peptides derived from the TDP-43 prion-like domain [43–45]. After 8 d, no further changes were detected and also no visible aggregate was formed. This implies that the wild-type prion-like domain is able to progressively assemble into larger but soluble oligomers at neutral pH. The deconvolution analysis of the CD spectra revealed that the soluble oligomer formed at 8 d contains ~3% helical but ~72% β-sheet and β-turn, as well as ~25% random coil conformations.
Even after 15 min, many HSQC peaks became broadened (Fig 1D), implying the occurrence of dynamic oligomerization. After 4 hr (Fig 1E) and 9 hr (Fig 1F), most peaks became very broad and consequently the intensity became weak. After 1 d, most peaks became too broad to be detectable (Fig 1G). Furthermore, the NMR sample in pH 6.8 buffer formed hydrogels after 1 d, which could change back to solution upon shaking, similar to what was also observed on the fused in sarcoma (FUS) prion-like domain [30,49]. However, higher protein concentrations such as at 200 μM would result in the rapid precipitation with white aggregates upon dilution into the buffer at pH 6.8.
Interestingly, as seen in S3E Fig, immediately upon dilution into the 1 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), the wild type showed a large intensity of the ThT-binding induced fluorescence with the emission maximum at ~488 nm, implying its fast formation of the β-rich amyloid-like structure. After 1 d, the intensity was further increased and then reached the highest point after 2 d, followed by the reduction of the intensity afterward.
As seen in Fig 4A–4D, after one week, the wild type and three mutants were all able to form amyloid fibrillar structures, with the widths of fibrils ranging from 15 to 30 nm, similar to the fine structures that were detected in the neuronal TDP-43 inclusions in patients’ brain tissues [57].
On the other hand, amorphous structures of diverse sizes were observed for the aggregates rapidly formed by diluting the wild type into 1 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.8 to reach a concentration of 200 μM (Fig 4E).
Indeed, as characterized by CD spectroscopy, ssDNA was able to bind and trigger the significant conformational changes for the wild-type prion-like domain (S7A Fig).
As judged from CD spectra in the presence of DPC at different ratios (Fig 7C), gradual addition of DPC induces progressive increase of the helical conformation, with the significant transition occurring over the ratios 50–100 (prion:DPC).
Indeed, as characterized by CD spectroscopy, ssDNA was able to bind and trigger the significant conformational changes for the wild-type prion-like domain (S7A Fig).
However, upon addition of ssDNA at a ratio of 1:0.5 (protein:ssDNA), two very up-field peaks started to manifest and their intensity become much higher at a ratio of 1:1 (Fig 6A).
Very interestingly, for the wild type, although at a ratio of 1:0.5 many peaks became too broad to be detected mostly due to the involvement in forming the large oligomer, a set of HSQC peaks is still detectable and mostly superimposable to those in the free state (Fig 6B).

SSP analysis and manifestation of a large amount of NOEs indicate that the membrane-interacting subdomain transforms into a well-folded structure in the membrane environment.
Furthermore, consistent with the CD results, HSQC titrations also showed that the prion-like domain underwent conformational changes with gradual addition of DPC, as indicated by the significant shifts of some HSQC peaks (Fig 7D and 7E).
As seen in Fig 7A, in the presence of bicelle at a ratio of 1:200 (prion:bicelle), the prion-like domain has a far-UV CD spectrum very different from that in aqueous solution, with the maximal negative signal shifted from 198 to 203 nm; and a new negative signal at 222 nm, implying that the prion-like domain indeed has the subdomain which can interact with membranes to form helical conformation.
As judged from CD spectra in the presence of DPC at different ratios (Fig 7C), gradual addition of DPC induces progressive increase of the helical conformation, with the significant transition occurring over the ratios 50–100 (prion:DPC).
Furthermore, in the presence of bicelle, many HSQC peaks underwent shifts and some even completely disappeared, as well as the peaks of three Trp side chains became well-separated (Fig 7B). This observation suggests that upon interacting with bicelle, each of Trp side chains has different chemical environment. Strikingly, the disappeared peaks were identified to be from residues Met307-Gln344, indicating that these residues became tightly associated with the large bicelle, consequently their HSQC peaks became too broad to be detected due to shortening of their T2 values [79].
Furthermore, consistent with the CD results, HSQC titrations also showed that the prion-like domain underwent conformational changes with gradual addition of DPC, as indicated by the significant shifts of some HSQC peaks (Fig 7D and 7E).

After arsenite treatment we observed the formation of cytoplasmic foci which stained positive for TIAR (80% of cells) and HuR (60% of cells). A sub-group of cells with TIAR or HuR-positive SGs (30% and 50%, respectively) showed co-localization also with TDP-43 protein in cytoplasmic granules (Fig. 1a and b).
We observed that TDP-43 co-localized with the SG markers TIAR and HuR in granules after 30-min exposure of NSC34 cells to heat shock (Figs 3a,b and S1) and that pre-treatment with emetine abolished the formation of such cytoplasmic structures (Fig. 3c).
The two-dimensional 1H-15N NMR correlation spectra (heteronuclear single quantum coherence, HSQC) of wild type (WT), D290V, and P298L hnRNPA2 LC have a narrow chemical shift range, characteristic of a disordered protein (Figure 1A).
In addition, all hnRNPA2 LC variants show initial turbidity consistent with liquid-liquid phase separation but only D290V and P298L show turbidity at time points longer than 3 hours (Figure S4A), suggesting formation of static aggregates.
At 50 mM NaCl, FRAP experiments indicate that droplets of WT, D290V, P298L are liquid at early time points, as the fluorescent signal redistributes after bleaching part of individual droplets (Figure 3D).
DIC micrographs show hnRNPA2 LC WT, D290V, and P298L form liquid droplets. Over time, D290V droplets seed persistent aggregates with fibrous structure. P298L forms non-spherical clusters consistent with aggregation.
1H-15N spectra of UBQLN2 450–624 revealed a concentration of amide resonances between 8.0 – 8.5 ppm in 1H dimension, consistent with a largely disordered construct (Figure 3A).
These data demonstrate that much of UBQLN2 450–624 is disordered. However, the UBA domain exhibits significant α-helical propensity, consistent with its known structure. Residues 450–460, located in the STI1-II domain, exhibit slight α-helical propensity and are predicted to be somewhat ordered according to PONDR-FIT calculations (Figure S1A).
Using a combination of backbone amide, Cα, Cβ, and CO chemical shifts, we predicted secondary structure population using the δ2D algorithm (Figure 3D) (Camilloni et al., 2012). These calculations confirmed the UBA domain to be α-helical.
Backbone R2 relaxation rates for UBQLN2 487–624 reinforced the notion that residues 487–580 were generally intrinsically disordered; R2 rates were 2–4 s-1, similar to the intrinsically disordered region in FUS in the non-phase separated state (Burke et al., 2015).
When cells were exposed to arsensite stress, only FL UBQLN2 and UBQLN2 450–624 formed cytoplasmic puncta (Figure 2E). Moreover, even at slightly higher expression level than FL UBQLN2 (Figure 2F), UBQLN2 450–624 formed less puncta (Figures (Figures2E,2E, ,2G),2G), consistent with its reduced propensity to undergo LLPS in vitro. We noted that a portion of exogenously-introduced UBQLN2 colocalized with SG markers, whereas some exogenous UBQLN2 formed puncta that did not colocalize with SG marker.
The additional N-terminal residues in the longer construct (341–386) are largely clustered in a small group with a narrow range of 1H chemical shifts indicative of unstructured polypeptide chain (shown in box).
Thus, the NMR and CD data are in good agreement and suggest that the N-terminal extension in the 341–440 UBA construct is not significantly structured.
The spectrum of the longer construct has a more pronounced minimum at 205 nm, which indicates a significant contribution to the spectrum from a disordered random coil part of the polypeptide.
Thus, the NMR and CD data are in good agreement and suggest that the N-terminal extension in the 341–440 UBA construct is not significantly structured.
NMR analysis provides no evidence of short- or long-range NOE interactions in the free peptide.
 The binding of the peptide to the SH3 domain was investigated using NMR, CD, and ITC at 30 °C (Table 2). Despite the quite different methods the binding data are in good agreement. Using these very different probes of binding the average KD is found to be of the order of 31 μM, giving a free energy ΔG° for the interaction of −26 kJ·mol-1.
The featureless CD spectrum is consistent with the free peptide being nonstructured.
The figure shows three independently determined spectra:  the spectrum for the free peptide at 22 °C suggesting that there is no secondary structure present; the spectrum of P2L peptide bound to the Fyn SH3 domain in a 1:1 concentration ratio with the spectrum of the free SH3 domain subtracted; the spectrum of free P2L peptide at −104 °C showing PPII helical conformation.

To test the disorder prediction of this important domain, we performed circular dichroism (CD) measurements, which demonstrate a random coil signature (32) for the isolated RGG domain compared with the predominantly alpha-helical secondary structure of the FL and terminal deletions (Fig. 5B).
In contrast, deletion of the RGG-rich N terminus (ΔRGG) results in no observable droplets, even up to concentrations as high as 250 μM, revealing the N-terminal RGG domain as essential for phase separation. Moreover, the isolated N-terminal RGG domain was alone sufficient for forming droplets (Fig. 5C).
Because the RGG domain is sufficient for RNA binding (Fig. S8), we asked whether the disordered RGG domain could be responsible for the observed dynamic binding to RNA. Applying our FRET assay to the truncation mutants, we find that both ΔC and the RGG domain alone exhibit highly dynamic FRET traces, similar to that seen in the full-length construct (Fig. 5D). However, ΔRGG gives rise to a static, tightly wrapped conformation of bound RNA, similar to that observed in non–droplet-forming conditions (Fig. 4 B and C).
L1 is partially disordered, and also binds the second SH3 domain.
Our studies demonstrate that linker regions between modular domains can contribute to the driving forces for self-assembly and phase separation of multivalent proteins.
Conserved interdomain linker promotes phase separation of the multivalent adaptor protein Nck.
Keap1 is a BTB-Kelch substrate adaptor protein that regulates steady-state levels of Nrf2, a bZIP transcription factor, in response to oxidative stress. We have determined the structure of the Kelch domain of Keap1 bound to a 16-mer peptide from Nrf2 containing a highly conserved DxETGE motif. The Nrf2 peptide contains two short antiparallel β-strands connected by two overlapping type I β-turns stabilized by the aspartate and threonine residues. The β-turn region fits into a binding pocket on the top face of the Kelch domain and the glutamate residues form multiple hydrogen bonds with highly conserved residues in Keap1.
Intriguingly, although the molecular weight of FL-Nrf2 is only 70.4 kDa (including the His-tag), it runs with an apparent MW of ~110 kDa on SDS-PAGE gels as already reported previously [44] (Figure S1). The high net charge and aberrant SDS-PAGE migration behavior suggest that FL-Nrf2 may be partially disordered
CD spectropolarimetry was applied for assessing the secondary structure of FL-Nrf2 at 5, 10, 25, and 35 °C. The negative bands at 208 and 222 nm indicate the presence of α-helical structural elements (Figure 1A). Spectral deconvolution indicates that at 25 °C, there are around 27% α-helical, 21% β-strand and 52% disordered/turn structures, implying that Nrf2 is indeed partially disordered (Figure 1B; Table S1).
We used NMR spectroscopy to further verify the disordered nature of FL-Nrf2. Figure 2 shows the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of FL-Nrf2 acquired at 5, 10, 25, and 35 °C. At all four temperatures, despite the presence of some well-dispersed peaks with relatively weak intensities, most of the observed backbone amide signals are crowded in a narrow region between 7.8 and 8.7 ppm in the 1H dimension. This lack of 1H resonance dispersion indicates that many parts of FL-Nrf2 do not adopt stable structures and undergo rapid conformational interconversion [51,52,53,54]. In addition, the disordered nature of FL-Nrf2 does not change significantly at lower temperatures. For comparison, we also acquired the HSQC spectrum of FL-Nrf2 at 35 °C in the presence of 6 M urea, under which conditions the protein was expected to be largely unfolded (Figure S3). The similarity of all these spectra therefore suggest that FL-Nrf2 is already extensively unfolded even in the absence of urea.
Fast HDX kinetics were observed throughout the entire protein, where the majority of the peptides exhibit ~100% deuteration after 12 s. This lack of protection indicates that FL-Nrf2 is significantly disordered (Figure S6). Notably, several peptides in distinct parts of the protein showed somewhat slower deuteration. For instance, the peptide covering residues 54–74 in the Neh2 domain only displayed complete deuteration after >24 s. This observation is consistent with earlier findings that even though the Neh2 domain is disordered, helical propensity exists between residues 39 and 71 [22]. Other regions that showed somewhat slower exchange are 235–249, 417–434, and 512–537. They are located in the Neh7 domain, the linker between the Neh6 and Neh1 domains, and the Neh1 domain, respectively.
We also investigated how FL-Nrf2 interacts with Kelch, which is part of the negative regulator Keap1. Previous studies showed that the isolated Neh2 domain of FL-Nrf2 binds Kelch at two sites: the high- affinity ETGE motif (around residues 76–84; Kd ~5 nM) and the low-affinity DLG motif (around residues 17–46; Kd ~1 μM) [22]. Here we used HDX-MS to further dissect the effects of Kelch-binding on the conformational dynamics of FL-Nrf2. In these experiments, the FL-Nrf2 concentration was held constant at 2 μM, while the Kelch concentration varied from 2 to 4 and 6 μM, which corresponded to FL-Nrf2:Kelch ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3, respectively (Figure 4).
Significant changes in deuterium uptake were observed in the Neh2 domain upon the addition of Kelch. In the presence of 1:1 Kelch, a considerable reduction in FL-Nrf2 deuterium uptake was displayed around the ETGE binding motif and a small reduction in deuterium uptake around the DLG motif, consistent with the binding affinities of the two sites. For a 1:2 ratio, a substantial reduction in deuterium uptake was observed around the DLG binding site and an even more significant reduction in HDX close to the ETGE motif. Further reduction in deuterium uptake around both sites was noted at a 1:3 ratio. Notably, the addition of Kelch did not slow down the deuterium uptake in any other domains of FL-Nrf2.

Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription regulator that plays a pivotal role in coordinating the cellular response to oxidative stress. Through interactions with other proteins, such as Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), CREB-binding protein (CBP), and retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRα), Nrf2 mediates the transcription of cytoprotective genes critical for removing toxicants and preventing DNA damage, thereby playing a significant role in chemoprevention.

Peptide competition experiments were carried out using 14-mer peptides that contained either an alanine or phosphothreonine in place of T80. A 14-mer peptide corresponding to amino acids 74–87 of Nrf2 that contained an alanine in place of T80 was unable to displace HA-Nrf2 from Keap1-CBD even at input peptide levels 100-fold higher than that needed for the wild-type peptide to displace Nrf2 from Keap1 (Figure 7A, compare lanes 3–6 with lanes 7–10). Likewise, a 14-mer peptide that contained a phosphothreonine residue in place of T80 was also unable to displace Nrf2 from Keap1 (Figure 7A, lanes 11–14).
KEAP1 is a substrate-specific adapter of a BCR (BTB-CUL3-RBX1) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex.
We found that wild-type (WT) Neh2(1-56) nicely interacted with Keap1 (WT in Fig. 2B). The D38H and Q43G mutant forms retained the same binding activity as the WT, and the S33R and Q43R mutant forms exhibited slightly stronger binding activity than the WT (Fig. 2C, right panel).
The peptide used in this assessment derives from the mouse form. The Q43R mutant corresponds to the human protein sequence.

In addition, the lack of a defined conformation in the backbone region of bound MLL140–160 between anchored residues F148 and F151 is in agreement with the absence of amide proton signals for G150 and F151 in NMR spectra due to exchange-related signal broadening.
MLL forms a ternary complex with the lens epithelium–derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75) and MENIN.
MLL140–160 is anchored between the two interhelical loops of LEDGF/p75 IBD (aa I359 to D369 and K402 to M413) via F148 and F151 (Fig. 3B).
Binding of MLL140–160 to the IBD was further investigated using ITC. The ITC results corresponded with a stoichiometry close to 1:1 (n = 1.15). They were fitted by a single-site binding model, which provided the dissociation constant (Kd) of 86.3 ± 21.3 μmol/L (Fig. 2E). These results confirmed the existence of an additional interface between LEDGF/p75 and MLL.

Addition of the synthetic BubR1 KEN1 peptide reduced, but did not abolish, Cdc20 binding to BubR1N, indicating that other regions of BubR1N contributed to Cdc20 binding (Fig. S2B).
Both the N-terminal region (residues 81–164) and the C-terminal region (residues 477–499; including the IR motif) of Cdc20ΔN80 were disordered and not visible in the structure.

In the case of the β-catenin substrate, the segment between the destruction motif and the lysine is unstructured
Only residues 665–691 of β-catenin C-terminal domain, which were also identified by MR method, were visible in the electron density maps before and after density modification.
The 15N-TROSY spectrum of 15N-labeled β-catenin C-terminal tail alone shows poor dispersion of the resonance, indicating that the C-terminal tail per se does not have any folded structure.
The N-terminal domain of β-catenin has a poor expression yield and tends to be degraded during purification.
The high-resolution crystal structure of TIP-1 in complex with the C-terminal peptide of β-catenin provides molecular details for the recognition of β-catenin by TIP-1.

In this study, the phosphorylation of b-catenin at Ser45 was characterised using a phospho-specific antibody.
These findings, together with the conservation of this lysine among β-catenin orthologs and paralogues (Table 1), suggest that Lys19 is a ubiquitination site of β-catenin in vivo.
Serine 23 of β-catenin was determined as a site for O-GlcNAc modification which regulated its subcellular distribution, its interactions with cellular partners and consequently its transcriptional activity.
LiCl is a potent GSK-3 inhibitor (Stambolic et al. 1996, Hedgepeth et al. 1997) and indeed suppressed T41/S37/S33 but not S45 phosphorylation (Figure 2B).

In line with loss of SIRT1 repression, expression of wild type MCC but not MCC‐R506Q mutant resulted in β‐cat‐K49 deacetylation (Fig. 6c).
PTK6 directly phosphorylates beta-catenin on Tyr64, Tyr142, Tyr331 and/or Tyr333, with the predominant site being Tyr64.
ITC experimentsusing our present system show weak binding of Lin-7 to the C-terminal of β-catenin (SupplementaryData Fig. 5).
To test whether Fhit directly interacts with LEF-1 or β-catenin, in vitro pull-down experiments with purified recombinant fusion proteins were performed. In contrast to Hint1, Fhit directly associates with β-catenin.
We demonstrate that the mutants D32A and G34A exhibit no change in phosphorylation by GSK3β, but display reduced ubiquitination compared to wild-type and S33A mutant β-catenin.
D32A and G34A were greatly reduced compared to WT β-catenin in their degree of ubiquitination.
Since the phosphorylation status of D32A and G34A is normal, we concluded that alterations to the ubiquitination status of β-catenin are due to its interaction with the ubiquitin machinery and its function as a ubiquitin substrate.
A greater than 50% reduction in phosphorylation was seen in the QUAD (S33AS37AT41AS45A) and S33AS37A mutants, as expected for partial serine/threonine mutants of β-catenin. Since there are multiple kinase sites that are substrates for GSK3β, no β-catenin mutants showed complete loss of phosphorylation similar to the α-catenin control. 
The double serine mutant S33S37A served as a negative control, since β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination of β-catenin is phosphorylation dependent.
The phosphoserine, aspartic acid, and hydrophobic residues of the destruction motif are recognized directly by contacts from β-TrCP1.
The destruction motif comprises the 32-37 region. 
These findings support the structure-based conclusion that Asp32, pSer33, pSer37, and Gly34 are critical for β-TrCP1-β-catenin binding and specificity, while Ile35, which makes fewer contacts, plays a smaller role.
Of the 26 β-catenin residues in the crystals, only an 11 residue segment (residues 30 to 40), centered on the doubly phosphorylated destruction motif (residues 32 to 37), is ordered in the structure.
When the R7 mutant of ubiquitin is used, the SCFβ-TrCP1 monoubiquitinates the doubly phosphorylated β-catenin (lane 3) and IκBα (lane 6) peptides at comparable rates. The reaction is dependent on Lys19 in the β-catenin peptide (lane 5) and is specific for β-TrCP1 because Cul1-Rbx1 (lane 7) or SCFSkp2-Cks1 (lane 8) cannot substitute for SCFβ-TrCP1. 
These findings, together with the conservation of this lysine among β-catenin orthologs and paralogues (Table 1), suggest that Lys19 is a ubiquitination site of β-catenin in vivo.
The N-terminal 14 residues, which contain the phosphorylated Ser372 (pSer372), and the C-terminal five residues are not visible in the electron density maps and are presumably disordered.

[degron DEG_SIAH_1] peptide used in the crystallization included residues 107–130. Thus, residues 108–113 and 125–130 were flexible and could not be modeled.
degron motif (PXAXVXP) (as defined by House et al., 2003) that do interact with Siah include Arg115 and Thr123
Two regions of the molecule appeared to be disordered and were not modeled. These were the N-terminal portion of the SH2-kinase linker (residues 258 to 302) and a portion of the activation loop of the kinase domain (residues 484 to 500).
Tyr493 located in the disordered part of the ZAP70 activation loop is phosphorylated
"the electron density of wing 2 (residues 240–258) in the FOXA2-DBD/DBE2 structure could not be observed. This result suggested that wing 2 was flexible and disordered in the crystal."
"To test whether wing 2 contributes to FOXA2-DBD/DNA binding, we constructed a truncated fragment of FOXA2 without wing 2 and measured the DNA binding ability using ITC. The binding affinity of FOXA2 was reduced by ∼30-fold when the C-terminal wing 2 region was removed. These results suggested that wing 2 of FOXA2 was important for optimal DNA binding."
The 1H-15N HSQC two dimensional spectrum of this LAT protein segment is characteristic of a largely disordered polypeptide.
Assembly of LAT-scaffolded signalosomes.
The one-dimensional 1H-NMR spectra of the PRD-His fragments (prolin rich domains) also underscores a largely disordered conformational state. Chemical shifts show a poor dispersion, i.e. amide proton signals are clustered within a half-p.p.m. range centred at 8 p.p.m., whereas the methyl group protons are clustered at around 1 p.p.m. Such a limited dispersion and signal overlap in 1H chemical shifts are typical of IDPs.
The molecular mechanism of the function of Caskins is not known at present. As a result of their large size, the capacity to bind multiple partners and the lack of catalytic domains, they probably fall into the class of scaffold proteins, which bind components of a signal transduction pathway simultaneously and ensure the speciﬁcity and efﬁciency of signal propagation. As the long regions of these proteins often lack any sequence similarity to other proteins and appear to lack folded structural domains, we anticipated that structural disorder may be a general feature of scaffold proteins. The ﬁrst and second proline-rich regions of Caskin1 (PRD1-GST and PRD2-GST were able to interact with the GFP-Abi2 protein.
The CD spectrum of PRD-His shows a minimum at 202 nm, which is characteristic of a protein in a largely disordered conformation. The CD spectra of the separate PRDs also show characteristic minima around 200 nm, which underscores the unstructured nature of these regions.
PRD-His shows a greater sensitivity to proteolysis with a protease of wide substrate speciﬁcity, subtilisin, than does the globular control protein BSA; this provides an indication of its disordered conformation.
Gel ﬁltration data also verify the disordered nature of the proline-rich region, as the apparent molecular mass (mapp) of PRD-His (334.5 kDa) is 3.9 times higher than the real value (85.9 kDa).

The majority of LM0P was random coil, interspersed with four short helical segments (Figs. 1 and 2 A and B). As defined by TALOS+ algorithms (17), the α1 and α2 segments (aa 23–26 and 29–31) spanned the COOH-half of the zinc finger. The α3 and α4 motifs, in the hinge region (aa 45–49) and near the COOH tail (aa 63–66), were less well defined.

When the 15N/13C protein labels were switched in Ran:LM0P complexes, the states of LM0P as influenced by Ran showed multiple peak shifts relative to free LM0P (Fig. 1 and Fig. S3A). The shifts included all residues in the hinge region, as had been anticipated from mutagenesis mapping (15). Also involved were regions from the carboxyl third of the protein. The zinc finger region did not change, maintaining the α1 and α2 helices. However, as with both phosphorylation datasets, the rest of (Ran):LM0P now became more compact (Fig. 4B).

"electron density was not observed for the C-terminal wing 2 region of the FoxO1 DBD suggesting that it is flexible and disordered in the crystals."
"we crystallized and determined the structure of FoxO1 151–266 bound to the IRE and DBE2 sequences, but electron density was not observed for residues 242–266."
"wing 2 enhances affinity through forming transient and/or multiple nonspecific electrostatic interactions with the phosphate backbone of the DNA. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that acetylation of Lys245 and Lys248 in wing 2 by CBP/p300 reduces DNA binding affinity"
"the lack of electron density at the C-terminal second wing (W2) indicates its flexibility and disorderness in FoxO1. Although we used the entire FoxO1-DBD (amino acids 154–262) in crystallization, the final electron density was only visible for the regions between amino acid 160 and 245 for both monomers."
Experimental NMR chemical shifts and 15N relaxation data demonstrate that Mdm2(216-302) is an intrinsically unstructured and highly flexible monomeric protein in solution, as confirmed by static light scattering analysis.
This acidic region of Mdm2 forms a fuzzy complex with a short sequence encompassing the alternatively spliced exon 3 (Ex3) of Numb.
Our NMR data demonstrate that the Numb-Mdm2 binding interface comprises residues 216-302 of the Mdm2 acidic domain.
The in-cell NMR spectrum of Gli3RD (Gli3 repressor domain) expressing cells is qualitatively similar to that of the purified protein, measured at pH 7.4. All of the proton peaks lie within a narrow window of 8 ppm that is typical for unfolded peptides.
The transcription factor Gli3 contains an RD (repressor domain) in its N-terminus that represses gene expression. We previously identified the Gli3RD to reside between residues G106 to E236. Sequence analyses of Gli3RD revealed higher than average content of histidines, serines and prolines, particularly in the N-terminal region from residues G106 to D170. This makes the sequence being potentially capable of binding to Zn2+ ions, post-translationally modified, and extended and rigid.
Chz1 alone yielded a typical CD spectrum characteristic of an unfolded polypeptide chain, suggesting that Chz1 is unfolded in physiological conditions.

The 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the full-length protein shows highly crowded cross-peaks in the spectral region between 8 and 8.5 ppm indicating that the protein contains an unstructured region, in addition to several signals spread over a larger spectral range, indicative of folded conformations. After degradation, the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the resulting fragment shows the disappearance of many of the signals in the crowded, central region, whereas the well-resolved resonances are still present and do not show significant chemical shift changes. 15N{1H} NOEs experiments on the full-length anamorsin showed that the residues not belonging to the N-terminal domain (that are all in the highly crowded spectral region between 8 and 8.5 ppm) exhibited negative or very low NOEs, indicative of a high degree of flexibility in the C-terminal part of the protein. We can conclude that the N-terminal part is well-folded whereas the C-terminal part, comprising both the linker and CIAPIN1 domain, is largely unstructured and flexible and therefore, highly prone to degradation.
Anamorsin contains a well-folded N-terminal domain and a largely unstructured, flexible C-terminal part, containing a CIAPIN1 domain with highly conserved cysteine pattern. Secondary structure and folding predictions reveal that these two domains in anamorsin are separated by an unstructured amino acid linker of ∼50 residues and that a large part of the CIAPIN1 domain, in particular its initial segment (residues 222–266), is structurally highly disordered, whereas the final segment is predicted to be more structured. The latter region of the CIAPIN1 domain contains a twin CX2C motif whereas the initial segment of the CIAPIN1 domain contains the four additional cysteines of the highly conserved cysteine pattern. It is likely that cysteines of the highly conserved cysteine pattern in anamorsin are involved in iron binding. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the stable fragment is constituted by the N-terminal part spanning aa 1–172 of the protein. During degradation, the color of the anamorsin solution is lost, indicating that iron is released. Because the remaining stable fragment does not contain cysteines of the CIAPIN1 domain, at least one of the latter cysteines is essential for iron binding.
The CD spectra of RPELs exhibited a strong negative band near 200 nm and a weak negative shoulder at 220 nm, which is characteristic of unfolded polypeptides. This is supported by the prediction of structural disorder by IUPred, which indicates that RPEL1(85-116), RPEL2(129-160), and RPEL3 (173-204) are disordered. The negative band near 200 nm is stronger in the order of RPEL3 > RPEL2 > RPEL1.
Mouilleron et al. have shown that RPEL1 and RPEL2 bind to G-actin tightly, with dissociation constants (Kd) of 1.0 and 1.9 μM, respectively. They also showed that RPEL3 binds weakly to G-actin with a Kd value of 28.9 μM, although the essential residues for the interaction with G-actin are conserved in RPEL3. From these Kd values, the Gibbs free energy changes (ΔG0) of binding are −8.2 kcal/mol, −7.8 kcal/mol, and −6.2 kcal/mol for RPEL1, RPEL2, and RPEL3, respectively. The helical propensity is higher in the order of RPEL1, RPEL2, and RPEL3. These results suggest that the amount of preformed structure may correlate with the ΔG0 value of binding. It is conceivable that the binding strength between IDP and the target molecule is modulated by the preformed structural elements in free IDP.
According to the crystal structures of RPEL1 and RPEL2 in complex with G-actin, the RPEL motif adopts two α-helices and binds to the hydrophobic cleft and the hydrophobic ledge of G-actin. The essential residues for actin binding are completely conserved between RPEL2 and RPEL3, while the essential residues are partially different between RPEL1 and RPEL2: Ile140 and Leu155 of RPEL2 are substituted with Leu and Met in RPEL1, although Leu136, Lys139, Arg143, Leu149, and Ile154 of RPEL2 are conserved in RPEL1.

This is supported by the prediction of structural disorder by IUPred, which indicates that RPEL1(85-116), RPEL2(129-160), and RPEL3 (173-204) are disordered. The negative band near 200 nm is stronger in the order of RPEL3 > RPEL2 > RPEL1.
According to the crystal structures of RPEL1 and RPEL2 in complex with G-actin, the RPEL motif adopts two α-helices and binds to the hydrophobic cleft and the hydrophobic ledge of G-actin. The essential residues for actin binding are completely conserved between RPEL2 and RPEL3, while the essential residues are partially different between RPEL1 and RPEL2: Ile140 and Leu155 of RPEL2 are substituted with Leu and Met in RPEL1, although Leu136, Lys139, Arg143, Leu149, and Ile154 of RPEL2 are conserved in RPEL1.
Mouilleron et al. have shown that RPEL1 and RPEL2 bind to G-actin tightly, with dissociation constants (Kd) of 1.0 and 1.9 μM, respectively. They also showed that RPEL3 binds weakly to G-actin with a Kd value of 28.9 μM, although the essential residues for the interaction with G-actin are conserved in RPEL3. From these Kd values, the Gibbs free energy changes (ΔG0) of binding are −8.2 kcal/mol, −7.8 kcal/mol, and −6.2 kcal/mol for RPEL1, RPEL2, and RPEL3, respectively. The helical propensity is higher in the order of RPEL1, RPEL2, and RPEL3. These results suggest that the amount of preformed structure may correlate with the ΔG0 value of binding. It is conceivable that the binding strength between IDP and the target molecule is modulated by the preformed structural elements in free IDP.
The logarithmic plot of these calculated Rs values versus the molecular masses of the corresponding monomeric and dimeric Ump1 variants indicates that these proteins do not behave as natively folded globular proteins in solution, and fall very close to the plot representing the behaviour of molecules with a natively unfolded molten globule conformation
The CD spectra for all proteins (monomeric and dimeric wild-type Ump1, as well as Ump1-C115S mutant) exhibit isodichroic curves, with a minimum at 201 nm and a shoulder around 222 nm.
all preparations of wild-type Ump1 exhibit a very gradual – and almost constant – CD signal variation with temperature, from 25 to 90°C. This is unlike the typical behaviour of small, single domain folded globular proteins, where the unfolding is highly cooperative and occurs in a very narrow temperature range. Also, even at 90°C, Ump1 does not seem to be fully denatured...
The CD spectra from this Ump1 N-terminal proteolytic fragment confirm that, in accordance with the theoretical disorder predictions (Figure 2 and S2), the N-terminal region is largely unstructured (Figure 5).
Backbone chemical shift data indicated that Ump1 is an intrinsically unstructured protein and largely devoid of secondary structural elements.
Figure 1 shows the 1H–15N HSQC spectrum of Ump1 recorded at 30 °C. The HSQC peaks were observed within a narrow spectral region (7.3–8.5 ppm for the 1H chemical shifts), which indicated that Ump1 was largely unstructured in solution.
Positive NOE values indicative for increased rigidity were observed for residues between Ala-425 and Tyr-435, while negative values were obtained outside this region. Together, the NOE pattern and the results from dynamic measurements suggested that CaMBD consists of an ordered most likely helical core region flanked by flexible N and C termini.
Both types of interactions with CaM require a domain of about 90 amino acids in the proximal C terminus of the channel subunit, the calmodulin binding domain (CaMBD). As long as the CaMBD is present at the C terminus of the SK α-subunit, channels exhibit regular Ca2+-gating; deletions of more than 10 residues resulted in channels that were no longer gated by intracellular Ca2+.

Adding a small amount of Bin1–SH3 (molar ratio of 5:1) only affects the line widths and chemical shifts of amide resonances in the region 342 to 366 (Fig. 4a) comprising three canonical SH3 binding sites (PPII helix motifs): one of class I [PP1.2 (348–354)] and two of class II [PP2.1 (343–348) and PP2.2 (351–356)] (Fig. 4c).
Residues 342-366 of the nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) from Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (strain HC-J4) corresponds to 2314-2338 residues of the polyprotein.
The Kratky representation of these data, shown in Fig. 3d, is characteristic of a highly disordered protein. Nevertheless, a small bump observed in this scattering curve (at s ≈ 0.7) is indicative of a certain degree of compactness.
For most residues, the absolute values of these secondary chemical shifts are below 1.0 to 1.5 ppm, indicating the absence of any persistent secondary structure in this protein fragment consistent with an IDP.
This refers to a macroscopic system with a high binding affinity of the two proteins, consistent with a Kd of 0.1 μM measured by surface plasmon resonance for a short NS5A(333–369) fragment that comprises the entire poly-proline rich region (Fig. S6).
Residues 333-369 of the nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) from Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (strain HC-J4) corresponds to 2305-2341 residues of the polyprotein.
Upon addition of SH3 at concentrations higher than the equimolar concentration, chemical shift changes were observed for NS5A residues 200–228 (binding site B1) and 295–320 (binding site B2).
Residues 200-228 (B1) of the nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) from Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (strain HC-J4) corresponds to 2172-2200 residues of the polyprotein.
Upon addition of SH3 at concentrations higher than the equimolar concentration, chemical shift changes were observed for NS5A residues 200–228 (binding site B1) and 295–320 (binding site B2).
Here we have shown that NS5A interacts with SH3 domains via three distinct binding regions, with one (B3) corresponding to the canonical PxxP motif and the other two (B1 and B2) not containing such a canonical SH3 recognition element.
Residues 295-320 (B2) of the nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) from Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (strain HC-J4) corresponds to 2267-2292 residues of the polyprotein.
In the following, we will focus on the interaction of NS5A(191–340) with the Bin1-SH3 domain that induces the largest chemical shift changes in the NS5A spectrum. A very similar pattern of chemical shift changes and line broadening was observed in NMR titration experiments (Figure 3B) as shown in Figure 2B for the longer NS5A construct, indicating that the observed perturbation is due to direct SH3 binding events, and not to conformational changes induced by the high-affinity interaction of the SH3 domain with the PxxP motif of NS5A.
Residues 191-340 of the truncated nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) from Hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (strain HC-J4) corresponds to 2163-2312 residues of the polyprotein.
Besides the interaction with SH3 domains mediated by a canonical PxxP motif located in the LCS-2 region of NS5A (binding site B3), we were able to identify two additional peptide regions in NS5A that interact with the four SH3 domains mentioned above (Figure 2B).
For a NS5A:SH3 ratio of 1:1 (yellow), chemical shift changes can mainly be detected close to the PxxP motifs.
Here we have shown that NS5A interacts with SH3 domains via three distinct binding regions, with one (B3) corresponding to the canonical PxxP motif and the other two (B1 and B2) not containing such a canonical SH3 recognition element.
More surprisingly, the hetNOE values of NS5A residues in the binding regions decrease upon interaction with SH3, in agreement with a more flexible structural ensemble. The interaction of NS5A with Bin1-SH3 via low-affinity binding sites B1 and B2 thus adds another example of a “fuzzy” complex(34-36) formed between a globular protein domain and an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP).
Consequently, at an equimolar mixture of the two proteins at 100 μM concentration, this high-affinity NS5A(191–369) binding site is saturated, and only peaks from the bound state were observable in the NMR spectra.

Backbone chemical shifts of free YopE were compared with those expected for a random coil state. The deviations from random coil values of secondary chemical shifts (Δδ) in 15N, 1H, and 13C dimensions of the chaperone binding (Cb) region of free YopE were found to be close to zero, indicating that this region was in a random coil state.

In contrast, when SycE was bound, these same residues of YopE had values significantly different from those typical for a random coil state. These results provide evidence for SycE promoting a transition in the Cb region from an unstructured state to a structured conformation.
Chaperone dimers provide rigid and globular surfaces, around which effectors wrap an ∼25–100-residue chaperone-binding (Cb) region in strikingly extended conformation. SycE binding brought about a pronounced disorder-to-order transition in the Cb region but had no effect on other portions of YopE.

By contrast the far-UV CD spectrum of SpoIISB has less pronounced features with a shallow minimum at 200 nm. This spectrum is barely distinct from the CD spectrum of a control sample containing buffer alone. We deduce from this spectrum that SpoIISB is natively disordered.
The addition of SpoIISB leads to an increase in the molar ellipticity of the sample at 190–200 nm and a decrease in the molar ellipticity over the wavelength range 205–225 nm. This indicates that the addition of SpoIISB to His6-CSpoIISA leads to an increase in the amount of protein that has secondary structure. Because the CD spectrum of SpoIISB alone indicates that this protein is unstructured, we conclude that CSpoIISA induces structure in SpoIISB as the two proteins form a complex.

These observations are consistent with the crystal structure, which shows that SpoIISB exhibits secondary structure in the complex that is dependent on extensive packing against SpoIISA.
Surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed that the CSpoIISA·SpoIISB complex is stable with a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range.
Here, the crystal structure of a cytoplasmic fragment of SpoIISA (CSpoIISA) in complex with SpoIISB has been determined by selenomethionine-multiwavelength anomalous dispersion phasing to 2.5 Å spacing, revealing a CSpoIISA2·SpoIISB2 heterotetramer. CSpoIISA has a single domain α/β structure resembling a GAF domain with an extended α-helix at its N terminus. The two CSpoIISA protomers form extensive interactions through an intermolecular four-helix bundle. Each SpoIISB chain is highly extended and lacking tertiary structure. The SpoIISB chains wrap around the CSpoIISA dimer, forming extensive interactions with both CSpoIISA protomers.

Surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed that the CSpoIISA·SpoIISB complex is stable with a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range.
High affinity binding of CSpoIISA to SpoIISB is largely conferred by the low rate of complex dissociation, reflected in the slow release of bound SpoIISB from the sensor chip after the end of the injection (Fig. 2B). This could have biological implications in effective blocking of SpoIISA by SpoIISB in vivo under conditions of limited renewal of the available SpoIISB pool in the cell.

Inappropriate spoIISA expression causes lysis of vegetatively growing B. subtilis cells and Escherichia coli cells when expressed heterologously, effects that are countered by co-expression of spoIISB, identifying SpoIISA-SpoIISB as a toxin-antitoxin system.
However, when spoIISA was co-expressed with spoIISB deletants encoding proteins in which 3 or 12 N-terminal residues were replaced by Met-Ala and Met-Ala-Ala, respectively, the sporulation efficiencies of the strains were similar to the wild type strain (2.9 × 108 and 8.4 × 108 spores/ml; Fig. 4A). These results suggest that the N-terminal 12 residues are dispensable for the antitoxin activity of SpoIISB in vivo. Because the missing residues include Cys9′, the disulfide bridge is probably not critical for the antidote function. The sporulation efficiencies of strains encoding SpoIISB proteins with C-terminal deletions of 16, 12, 8, and 4 residues were 9.5 × 103, 5.7 × 103, 6.6 × 103, and 4.8 × 103 spores/ml, respectively. These are similar to the sporulation efficiency of cells in which the entire spoIISB gene has been deleted. Thus, C-terminal deletion of four or more residues leads to a loss of the capacity of SpoIISB to overcome SpoIISA toxicity.
Whereas ExsE is rapidly degraded to small undetectable peptides by SDS-PAGE following a brief treatment with subtilisin. The limited stability of ExsE towards proteolytic digestion suggests that it either lacks of stable tertiary fold or adopts a highly dynamic structure.
ExsE lacks stable secondary structures, and resembles random coil conformations in solution based on circular dichroism.
ExsE interacts with the secretion chaperone ExsC.
ExsE interacts with the secretion chaperone ExsC.
We identified regions that are partially ordered in the largely unstructured ExsE polypeptide. We found that these regions are correlated with those that adopt secondary structures when ExsE binds to ExsC. In the stable ExsE-ExsC interface, ExsE is in the fully extended conformation, and two signature β strands at both the N- and C-termini of the ExsE polypeptide pair with two symmetry-related five-stranded β sheets of dimeric ExsC. These findings suggest the importance of pre-existing ordered structured in binding of intrinsically disordered proteins to their targets.
The 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra showed that the amide proton chemical shifts of ExsE collapse in a narrow range of 7.8-8.6 ppm, consistent with the absence of secondary structures in ExsE. ExsE is highly dynamic throughout the polypeptide chain, as indicated by backbone dynamic analysis on relaxation times T1 and T2 of 15N and the {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOEs. Some local regions in the globally unstructured ExsE may possess residual or transient structure.
The 1H–15N HSQC spectrum showed signals with narrow lines and limited dispersion. In total, the δ2D prediction suggests that 29% of the residues in IF7 adopt helical conformations (helical percentages of >10%) and 71% of them populate random-coil conformations.
The activity of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 glutamine synthetase (GS) type I is controlled by protein–protein interactions with two intrinsically disordered inactivating factors (IFs): the 65-residue (IF7) and the 149-residue one (IF17).
Glutamine synthetase (GS) is controlled by a post-translational regulatory mechanism involving protein–protein interactions with 65-residue (IF7) and 149-residue (IF17) inactivating proteins.
The CD spectrum showed a single minimum at approximately 200 nm (Fig. 2A) that is indicative of random or disordered secondary structure. 
The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of BECN1(1–150)[4CS]Y (Fig. 2B) displayed very narrow chemical shift dispersion (between 7.7 and 8.7 ppm) on the 1H dimension that is a characteristic feature of intrinsically disordered proteins.
Experimentally observed backbone chemical shifts of BECN1(1–150)[4CS]Y were then used to evaluate its secondary structure with the improved version of Chemical Shift Index software (CSI 2.0)34 which makes use of all 6 backbone chemical shifts (13Cα, 13Cβ, 13C, 15N, 1HN, and 1Hα), along with sequence-derived features. This analysis confirmed that BECN1 is disordered throughout its entire N terminus (1 to 150) except for a potential half-helical turn involving residues A44 and P45 (Fig. 2C).
Previously reported backbone chemical shifts of BecN-150CSY (http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu, Accession code: 25384) [16] were further analysed using the δ2D method [30] and the results are summarized in Figure 2. As expected, BecN-150CSY is predominantly random coil (Fig. 2A) which is consistent with results from Chemical Shift Index analysis using CSI 2.0 [15] as reported previously [16], though a slightly higher propensity of α-helical conformation was observed for residues adjacent to the BH3 domain (Fig. 2B) when compared with the rest of BecN-150CSY.
Using dioxane with a hydrodynamic radius of 2.12 Å as an internal reference (Eq. 2 [29]), Rh values for BecN-150CSY were calculated to range from 29.5 to 31.4 Å across the temperature range studied, with a mean value of 30.54 ± 0.68 Å. This Rh value of BecN-150CSY is in very good agreement with those reported previously for IDPs of approximately the same size, such as α-synuclein (140 amino acid residues, Rh ~ 29 Å [36]) and MSP2 (229 amino acid residues, Rh ~ 34 -39 Å [37]). Similarly, using the relationship between Rh and the number of residues, N, for IDPs, Rh IDP = 2.49 N 0.509 as reported by Marsh and Forman-Kay [38], an expected value of 32.3 Å for BecN-150CSY was obtained which again is in excellent agreement with Rh values derived from the PFG-NMR measurements.
As the temperature coefficients of backbone amide protons over the entire BecN-150CSY were well below -4.5 ppb K -1, this indicates that the backbone amide protons are not involved in any stable hydrogen bonds [40-42] and is in agreement with the characteristics of an intrinsically disordered protein
Unlike globular proteins, where amide protons involved in hydrogen bonding will display slow solvent exchange with the solvent (in the order of minutes or slower) and typically have a temperature coefficient more positive than -4.5 ppb/K, [41], no simple correlation between relatively rapid solvent exchange rates (Fig. 5B) and the measured temperature coefficients (Fig. 3C) were observed in the present study. Even in the presence of a 14 amino acids N-terminal purification tag, the residues that undergo the most significant exchange with the solvent water are near the N-terminus of BecN-150CSY. Notably, no significant difference in solvent exchange was observed for residues within the BH3 domain, hence, the degree of surface exposure, compared to the rest of the N-terminal domain.
Upon gel-filtration chromatography, the major protein-containing peak eluted at an earlier retention time than expected for a protein of the calculated molecular mass based on the amino acid sequence (Fig. 1B). 
These data demonstrated that the protein exists as a 1.2S monomer (Fig. 1C), hence the behavior on gel-filtration is indicative of the protein being intrinsically disordered rather than oligomeric.
The highly elongated shape of the molecule, as determined by its high frictional ratio in the sedimentation velocity experiment (f/f0: 2.2), is also a characteristic of an intrinsically disordered protein.
The slightly anomalous migration on SDS-PAGE is likely due to the high positive charge content of the molecule, another characteristic of an intrinsically disordered protein.
In solution competition assays, the IC50 (2.0 μM) value of BECN1(1–150)[4CS]Y was similar to that of a synthetic peptide whose sequence overlaps with the BECN1(BH3) domain (IC50 2.9 μM) and consistent with previously published binding data on BECN1(BH3) domain peptides.10,12,16 The similarity in the values between the BECN1(BH3) peptide and the entire N-terminal domain suggests the protein produced is fully functional and that regions outside of the BH3 domain are not involved in interactions with BCL2 family members.
BH3 domain of Beclin-1 corresponds to the region 105-130
When BCL2L1ΔC25 was titrated into the BECN1(1–150)[4CS]Y sample, only resonances located within or adjacent to the BH3 domain (residues 98 to 132) were significantly perturbed (Fig. 3A to H) with only a small number of new resonances detected in the BCL2L1ΔC25-bound form (highlighted in cyan circles in Fig. 3A). This indicates the exchange between the free and bound conformations of BECN1(1–150)[4CS]Y is intermediate (in the millisecond range) on the NMR chemical shift timescale.
BH3 domain of Beclin-1 corresponds to the region 105-130
Interestingly, the large majority of resonances of BECN1(1–150)[4CS]Y were completely unaffected (both peak intensity and linewidth) by the binding of its BH3 domain with BCL2L1ΔC25 (except for a small loss in intensity in residues adjacent to Q40, Fig. 3B), indicating that nearly all residues outside of the BH3 domain are tumbling as freely when bound to BCL2L1 as in the unbound form, and do not adopt any secondary or tertiary structure elements that are not present in the free form.
In addition, the BH3 domain α-helix induced upon interaction with BCL2L1 reverts to a disordered state when the complex is dissociated by exposure to a competitive inhibitor.
More importantly, our NMR analysis showed that upon binding to BCL2L1, the whole of the N-terminal region except the BH3 domain remains unstructured, suggesting that this interaction does not “nucleate” additional structural transitions beyond the formation of the α-helical BH3 domain.
In addition, the BH3 domain α-helix induced upon interaction with BCL2L1 reverts to a disordered state when the complex is dissociated by exposure to a competitive inhibitor.

As expected for disordered peptides,23, 24 the 1D-1H NMR spectra (Figure 3A) measured for the BH3D lacked peaks upfield of the strong methyl peaks at 0.8 ppm; contained broad peaks at about 8.3 ppm, the region characteristic for amide groups in random-coil conformation; and had little signal dispersion visible downfield of ~8.5 ppm, with the few peaks visible below 8.5 ppm being attributable to Trp sidechains.
The BECN1 BH3D CD spectra showed a large single negative transition at ~195 nm, indicative of a random coil conformation (Figure 3B); compared to the CD spectra of α-helical polypeptides which are expected to display a positive band at ~192 nm and a large negative split transition at 208 nm and 222 nm; and of β-strand polypeptides which would show a positive band at 195 nm and a negative band at 218 nm.
In contrast to the isolated BH3D, the molar ellipticity at 222 nm indicated that a BECN1 BH3D+HD+CCD construct has a much higher helical content, although not as high as that observed for a HD+CCD construct. This reduction in helical content suggests that the BH3D is disordered even when attached to the helical domains that follow it.
ITC measurements indicate that the BECN1 BH3D binds to BCL2 with a Kd of 10.4 μM (Table IV). Binding is abolished by Ala substitutions of the single residues L112, L116, or F123, as well as the double G120E+D121A substitution (DS).
This secondary structure content is unchanged upon addition of equimolar or 0.5-fold molar BECN1 BH3D, suggesting that the BH3D folds into a helix upon binding (Table III).
This secondary structure content is unchanged upon addition of equimolar or 0.5-fold molar BECN1 BH3D, suggesting that the BH3D folds into a helix upon binding (Table III). However, addition of a 10-fold molar excess of the BH3D reduces the helical content of the sample to 76%, consistent with a significant population of BH3D molecules being in a random coil conformation. In contrast to the BH3D, addition of equimolar or 10-fold excess molar DS BH3D peptide dramatically reduces the helical content of the sample to ~67% and ~45% respectively, indicating that there is no change in the secondary structure of the DS BH3D peptide, consistent with lack of binding to BCL2s.
Thus, the combined information from IDR predictions, CD, NMR and co-complex crystal structures indicates that the BECN1 BH3D undergoes a disorder to αhelix transition upon binding.
Electron density corresponding to residues 141–156 is missing, suggesting that similar to the BH3D preceding it (16), this region may be unstructured in certain physiological contexts.
A 72 residue fragment (residues 104–175) in the N-terminal region of Beclin-1 was found to bind robustly to Bcl-xL in a pull down assay (Figure 1(a)). Deletion of residues 104–131 eliminated interaction between Beclin-1 and Bcl-xL (Figure 1(a)), indicating that this 28 residue fragment of Beclin-1 is required for the protein to interact with Bcl-xL.
We further noted that Trx-Beclin-1 (104-131) binds to GST-Bcl-xL in a similar manner when compared to Trx-Beclin-1 (104-175), suggesting that the 28 residue fragment of Beclin-1 (residues 104–131) is likely to be sufficient for binding to Bcl-xL.
Mixing a peptide fragment encompassing Beclin-1 (104-131) (Figure 1(d) and (e)), but not its immediate C-terminal fragment (residues 132–175, data not shown), with Bcl-xL induced large chemical shift changes to a subset of resonances in the 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of 15N-labeled Bcl-xL, further supporting that the 28 residue fragment of Beclin-1 (residues 104–131) binds to Bcl-xL specifically. 
We found that Bcl-xL binds to Beclin-1 (104-131) with a relatively high affinity (Kd ∼1.4 μM) (Figure 1(c)). Longer Beclin-1 fragments with extensions in both the N and C termini of this 28 residue peptide did not increase the binding affinity of Beclin-1 to Bcl-xL (data not shown), further demonstrating that the 28 residue peptide fragment identified here represents the complete Bcl-xL-binding domain of Beclin-1.
Analysis of these NMR spectra showed that binding of the Beclin 1 BH3 domain affects extensive regions of M11, including not only residues of the hydrophobic groove and those that undergo conformational changes, but also residues from other regions of M11 (Fig. 2A). 
Our 2.5 Å crystal structure of the M11-Beclin 1 BH3 domain complex (Fig. 1) shows that the Beclin 1 BH3 domain binds to a hydrophobic surface groove on M11, similar to the binding of BH3 domains of proapoptotic proteins to other antiapoptotic Bcl-2s.
The Beclin 1 (1–135) fragment binds to γHV68 M11 with approximately 40-fold higher affinity than cBcl-2 and 65-fold higher affinity than KSHV Bcl-2 (Table 1).
The Beclin 1 (1–135) fragment binds to γHV68 M11 with approximately 40-fold higher affinity than cBcl-2 and 65-fold higher affinity than KSHV Bcl-2 (Table 1).
Thus, compared to the Beclin 1 BH3 domain, the 1–135 fragment binds approximately five-fold more strongly to M11, but does not bind significantly better to either cBcl-2 or KSHV Bcl-2.
Beclin 1-dependent, starvation-induced autophagy levels are downregulated by cBcl-2 (p < 0.001 for cBcl-2 versus empty vector), and even more potently by KSHV Bcl-2 (p < 0.0003 for KSHV Bcl-2 versus empty vector).
Transient expression of Beclin 1 in MCF7 cells leads to a marked increase in autophagy upon starvation (p = 0.0007 for starved versus unstarved cells), and this starvation-induced, Beclin 1-dependent autophagy is significantly downregulated by M11 expression (p = 0.00002 for M11 versus vector; Fig. 4F–H). As expected, the downregulation of starvation-induced autophagy by M11 is abrogated by coexpression of M11 and either L116A Beclin 1 (p = 0.00004 for mutant versus wt Beclin 1) or F123A Beclin 1 (p = 0.0002 for mutant versus wt Beclin 1; Fig. 4F–H); the Beclin 1 mutants that do not bind to M11.
Authors claim that the gamma-herpesvirus 68 Bcl-2 homolog M11 suppress Beclin-1 mediated autophagy, through its binding with the 1 - 135 region.
We first solved a structure of BCL2 bound to wild-type BECN1 BH3 (PDB code 5VAU, Table 2). This structure has four molecules in the asu, affording four views of the interaction (Figure 3(a)).
The wild-type BECN1 BH3 yielded IC50 values consistent with what we and others have reported previously for binding to BCL2L1 [3,4,18–20], while the p-T108 peptide bound slightly, though significantly, tighter (2.0 μM versus 1.2 μM, p < 0.0001) (Table 1, Figure S1(a,b)).
PIK3C3, BECN1 and ATG14 WT LIR motifs bound to GABARAPL1 in and extended conformation with the two core hydrophobic residues in position 0 and +3 deeply bound to the hydrophobic pockets HP1 and HP2.
The specific interactions observed in WT BECN1 structures were: 1) Hydrophobic contact between L99 (BECN1) in position +2 and the edge of HP2; 2) two hydrogen bonds between the guanidine of R28 (GABARAPL1) and the carbonyls of G101 (BECN1)-L100 (BECN1), as well as a third one between the carbonyl of N95 (BECN1) (or the side chain of S96 for the peptide structure) and the side chain of K48 (GABARAPL1) (Figure 5(a,b)).

Although none of these IDRs have a helical content sufficient for formation of a stable helix in the absence of TFE, addition of TFE induces a significant disorder-to-helix transition in all three IDRs (Table 4).
The putative core motif of BECN1 (FTLI amino acids F97-I100) was also mutated (F97A, I100A) and tested for interaction with the recombinant GST-Atg8 homologs. The mutations significantly reduced binding and confirmed a functional LIR motif in BECN1 (Figure 2).
BECN1 only bound with significant affinity to GABARAP and GABARAPL1.
The region includes the canonical LIR motif "FTLI"

Binding of the NCBD to 15N‐labeled AdV5 E1A(53–91) leads to large, fast exchange shifts of E1A cross peaks (Supporting Information Fig. S11); the chemical shift changes are considerably larger than for the corresponding AdV12 E1A(52–81) construct [Fig.3(C)]. This may reflect local sequence differences or, more likely, the presence of additional hydrophobic residues beyond the C‐terminus of the AdV5 CR1 motif that are absent from AdV12[Fig.1(A)].
The AdV5 E1A constructs are intrinsically disordered, with chemical shifts that deviate little from random coil values except for residues E13‐D21, which have a small propensity to form helical structure (∼30% population)
Titrations were performed in which aliquots of the unlabeled NCBD were added to 15N‐labeled AdV5 E1A(1‐91) and AdV12 E1A(1‐81) in order to map the NCBD binding sites (Supporting Information Figs. S13 and S17).
The chemical shift perturbations reveal three NCBD binding sites in homologous regions of AdV5 and AdV12 E1A; for AdV12, the NCBD binding sites are located between residues L10‐V30, S40‐L47, and V61‐F78 ​[Fig.3(B)].
Thus the interaction between E1A and TAZ2 can be characterized as a partly “fuzzy” complex, with one portion of the E1A sequence participating in a strong interaction with TAZ2, while the other portion, corresponding to the N‐terminal region, participating in an interaction characterized by multiple states in intermediate exchange on the NMR time scale.
For AdV5 E1A, the precise boundaries of the NCBD binding sites were more difficult to identify due to cross peak overlap and because of differences in the exchange regime, with many AdV5 E1A residues exchange broadened or in slow exchange on the chemical shift time scale.
More dramatic differences are observed between
the HSQC spectra of free and bound E1A (Fig. 2B). E1A is
largely unstructured in the free state as seen by the limited
chemical shift dispersion in the 1H dimension; backbone resonances
of both E1A(53–91) and E1A(1–139) show little deviation
of chemical shifts from random coil values (Fig. S2 A and
B)

HSQC cross peaks associated with these residues are broadened and/or shifted upon binding of pRb to E1A(27–91) or E1A(53–91) (Fig. S4C).
As expected (16), the LXCXE motif
in CR2 binds with high affinity to pRb; there is a large increase
in dispersion of the HSQC spectrum of E1A(106–139) in the
presence of pRb and exchange is slow on the chemical shift
timescale (Fig. S4A).
Interactions between the pRb pocket domain and 15N-labeled E1A peptides were examined using HSQC titrations (Fig. S4). As expected (16), the LXCXE motif in CR2 binds with high affinity to pRb; there is a large increase in dispersion of the HSQC spectrum of E1A(106–139) in the presence of pRb and exchange is slow on the chemical shift timescale (Fig. S4A).
Efficient displacement of p53 likely requires E1A to compete with both the AD1 and AD2 motifs for binding to NCBD, which would be favored in E1A constructs containing two or three NCBD binding sites. By competing for binding of p53, E1A may interfere with p53‐activated transcriptional programs that are mediated through interactions with the NCBD (also called IBiD) domain of CBP/p300,25 providing a plausible structural insight into the means whereby E1A might repress p53‐mediated apoptosis by inhibiting binding of p53 to both the NCBD and TAZ2 domains of CBP/p300.
Increased competition efficiency was observed for the longer CR1 constructs (AdV5 E1A(36–91) and AdV12 E1A(35–81)), which contain two NCBD binding sites, and the highest efficiency was observed for AdV5 E1A(1–91) and AdV12 E1A(1–81), an indication that both the N‐terminal and CR1 regions are required for efficient competition with p53 for the NCBD.
To test the hypothesis that E1A and p53 compete directly for TAZ2, p53(13–61) and E1A(53–91) were titrated into 15N-labeled TAZ2 and HSQC spectra were recorded.
Addition of equimolar E1A to the TAZ:p53 complex causes all TAZ2 cross peaks to shift to their characteristic positions in the HSQC spectrum of the binary TAZ2:E1A complex (Fig. 4A, Fig. S3C), indicating that E1A displaces the p53 TAD from TAZ2.
A well-defined α-helix is formed by residues E59–I65, with shorter helical turns between L72–V74 and L80–T82, and a compact loop between F66–A73.
Upon interaction with TAZ2, there are large changes in the E1A chemical shifts (Fig. S2C) indicative of coupled folding and binding.
E1A binds in a deep hydrophobic groove in the surface of TAZ2, formed at the interfaces between helices α1/α2 and α1/α3, and buries ≈1400 Å2 of the TAZ2 surface (Fig. 3 B and C).
Upon titration with pRb, the A53 cross peak shifts in slow exchange from its position in the spectrum of the TAZ2 binary complex to its position in the binary E1A(27–91):pRb complex (Fig. 5B) while the cross peaks of many residues in the region 39–51 are broadened (Fig. S5), confirming binding of pRb to its cognate site. Thus, despite the close proximity of the pRb and CBP/p300 binding sites in the E1A CR1 region, the NMR data provide unequivocal evidence that both TAZ2 and the pRb pocket domain can bind simultaneously to form a ternary TAZ2-E1A-pRb complex.
The 1H‐15N heteronuclear single‐quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of the unbound 15N‐labeled NCBD and 15N‐labeled E1A constructs are poorly dispersed​(Fig.2,2, black), especially in the 1H dimension, since both proteins are intrinsically disordered.
Titrations were performed in which aliquots of the unlabeled NCBD were added to 15N‐labeled AdV5 E1A(1‐91) and AdV12 E1A(1‐81) in order to map the NCBD binding sites (Supporting Information Figs. S13 and S17).
The chemical shift perturbations reveal three NCBD binding sites in homologous regions of AdV5 and AdV12 E1A; for AdV12, the NCBD binding sites are located between residues L10‐V30, S40‐L47, and V61‐F78 [Fig.3(B)].
Thus the interaction between E1A and TAZ2 can be characterized as a partly “fuzzy” complex, with one portion of the E1A sequence participating in a strong interaction with TAZ2, while the other portion, corresponding to the N‐terminal region, participating in an interaction characterized by multiple states in intermediate exchange on the NMR time scale.
The large shifts of E1A HSQC cross peaks upon binding to the NCBD reflect formation of structure in the bound state. The secondary structure of AdV12 E1A in complex with the NCBD was predicted from the bound E1A 1H, 13Cα and 15N chemical shifts using the program TALOS+.33 The results ​[Fig.3(D)] show that, upon binding to the NCBD, AdV12 E1A folds to form local helical structure between residues Q13 and F27 in the N‐terminal region and between residues E67 and A73 in the C‐terminal part of the CR1 region.
Efficient displacement of p53 likely requires E1A to compete with both the AD1 and AD2 motifs for binding to NCBD, which would be favored in E1A constructs containing two or three NCBD binding sites. By competing for binding of p53, E1A may interfere with p53‐activated transcriptional programs that are mediated through interactions with the NCBD (also called IBiD) domain of CBP/p300,25 providing a plausible structural insight into the means whereby E1A might repress p53‐mediated apoptosis by inhibiting binding of p53 to both the NCBD and TAZ2 domains of CBP/p300.

A 2D-NMR [15N,1H]-HSQC spectrum confirmed the intrinsically disordered character of Nogo-A-Δ20, as deduced from the low chemical shift dispersion in the 1H dimension. Using triple resonance experiments, 94% of the non-proline backbone residues were assigned. While secondary structure analysis and relaxation measurements highlighted the intrinsically disordered character of Nogo-A-Δ20, three stretches comprising residues 561-EAIQESL-567, 639-EAMNVALKALGT-650, and 693-SNYSEIAK-700 form transient α-helical structures.
Nogo-A-Δ20 interacts with sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) and tetraspanin-3. Extracellular loops 2 and 3 of S1PR2 were concluded to be the primary binding sites for Nogo-A-Δ20, binding occurred with affinities in the nanomolar range.
The CD spectrum of Nogo-A-Δ20 with its minimum at around 200 nm suggests a high proportion of unstructured regions, with some residual secondary structure.
This poly-E region is inferred by the curator to be disordered, based on MobiDB-Lite and according to experimental evidence demonstrating that poly-E repeats display random-coil-like conformation (PMID:16949547)
The low signal dispersion of the NORS region indicates already that it is indeed a natively disordered protein (IDP) region. 
The NORS region (approximately residues 1–75) shows strongly negative 13Cα secondary shifts for residues preceding a proline.
Overall, the NORS region appears, as predicted, natively disordered.
The presented NMR structural and dynamic data for the NORS region (His-PknG1–75; Fig. 1, C and D, and supplemental Figs. S2 and S3A) demonstrate that the NORS region is indeed rather unstructured and dynamic.
The N-terminal about 75 residues were predicted to show no regulatory secondary structure (NORS) but harbor the major in vivo phosphorylation site, namely threonine 63. Autophosphorylation in the N-terminal tail does not affect kinase activity but is required for the survival of the mycobacteria within host macrophages.
The obtained 13Cα,β chemical shifts were then compared with random-coil values in order to estimate secondary structure propensities. The reduced lunasin form shows some residual secondary structure. The calculated Δδi values are small, as compared to the characteristic values for structured regions in proteins (|Δδi| > 1 ppm), indicating that there is a reduced population of the secondary structures in solution because of an equilibrium with unstructured conformations.
Both, the helical region (Glu23-Ile30) as well as the 22 residues of the N-terminus were found to facilitate the binding to deacetylated N-terminal tail of histone H4.
Nearly all of the amide peaks in the previously assigned σ54(60-135) spectrum perfectly match the peaks in the σ54(1-135) spectrum. Almost all of the additional peaks in the σ54(1-135) spectrum have low dispersion of chemical shifts in the 1H dimension. These peaks correspond to the first 60 residues of σ54 and the low shift dispersion is characteristic of an unfolded protein segment.
The N-terminal activator interacting domain (AID) of σ54/rpoN binds the transcriptional activator NtrC1. σ54 only binds the transcriptional activators with significant affinity when the activator subunits are primarily in the ATP state.
The σ54 AID becomes structured after associating with the core loops of the transcriptional activator NtrC1C in its ATP state and the primary site of the interaction is the first predicted helix (residues 6-12).
The circular dichroism spectra of unbound ProTα and H1 reflect the low secondary structure content of each individual IDP, except for the small helix-turn-helix domain of H.
The binding of H1 to ProTα has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. However, the high net charge, low hydrophobicity and pronounced disorder in the free proteins raise the question of how much structure is formed when they interact. The circular dichroism spectrum of an equimolar mixture of the two proteins can be explained by the simple sum of the individual spectra, indicating that complex formation entails minimal changes in average secondary structure content.

To obtain residue-specific information, we employed NMR spectroscopy. 1H–15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of the individual proteins exhibit low dispersion of the 1H chemical shifts, as expected for IDPs. Only the globular domain of H1 (23-104), which is stably folded even in isolation, shows the large dispersion of resonances characteristic of tertiary structure.
The binding of H1 to ProTα has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. However, the high net charge, low hydrophobicity and pronounced disorder in the free proteins raise the question of how much structure is formed when they interact. The overall peak dispersion remains unchanged on complex formation, confirming that no pronounced tertiary structure is formed on binding. Nevertheless, small but clearly detectable peak shifts observed for ProTα and H1 indicate changes in the average chemical environment of the corresponding residues, as expected on interaction with the large opposite charge of the other IDP. For ProTα, 95% of the amide backbone nuclei could be assigned, which enabled a residue-specific analysis: the Cα secondary chemical shifts of ProTα show no evidence for the induction of persistent or transiently populated secondary structure on complex formation. The pronounced overlap in the NMR spectra of the unstructured parts of H1 precluded residue-specific assignments, but the clusters of Hα–Cα peaks in the 1H–13C HSQC spectrum from the lysine-rich disordered regions of H1 do not exhibit detectable chemical shift perturbations on titration with ProTα, and additional resonances do not emerge. We therefore have no indications of changes in secondary structure content in H1 on ProTα binding.

We examined the secondary structures of the isolated H2A-H2B heterodimer by TROSY-NMR. Almost all of the main-chain signals (i.e., HN, N, Cα, Cβ and C’ signals) could be assigned (96% for H2A; 95% for H2B). As shown in the experimental chemical shift indices obtained from the Cα and Cβ chemical shift values, both H2A and H2B contain a core histone fold comprising four α-helices together with two β-strands—namely, α1–β1–α2–β2–α3–αC, much as is observed for their counterparts in the nucleosome. Outside the histone fold of H2A, however, the N-terminal αN helix and the C-terminal β3 strand and 310 helix observed in the nucleosome are entirely disordered in the isolated H2A-H2B heterodimer.
Histone proteins have N-terminal and/or C-terminal flexible tails, which are modified by methylation and acetylation, and influence chromatin remodeling.
Histone tails play important roles in the dynamic functions of chromatin through posttranslational modifications such as acetylation, phosphorylation and methylation.

We have determined the tertiary structure of the full-length H2A-H2B in isolation by NMR coupled with the CS-Rosetta procedure. The isolated H2A-H2B heterodimer comprises 256 amino acids with long disordered tails, which is big enough for the CS-Rosetta calculation. The calculated structures show that both histones contain a four-helix core, arranged as α1–β1–α2–β2–α3–αC, similar to their corresponding structures in the nucleosome, together with the long disordered N- and C-terminal H2A tails and the long N-terminal H2B tail.

The far-UV CD spectrum of NUPR1L at pH 7.5 had minima at 210 nm, and a wide shoulder around 222 nm, which suggest the presence of helix- or turn-like conformations. This spectrum is different to that observed for NUPR1, with a minimum at around 205 nm, which was characteristic of random-coil conformations. However, as NUPR1L has one Trp, five Tyr, one Phe and two His, we cannot rule out the absorbance of aromatic residues, which also occur at these wavelengths. As it happened with the thermal denaturations followed by fluorescence, the transitions followed by the ellipticity at 222 nm did not show any sigmoidal behaviour, suggesting that possible helical or turn-like conformations were not rigid. We conclude that NUPR1L was an IDP on the basis of two pieces of evidence. The absence of sigmoidal transitions in fluorescence and CD thermal and in the fluorescence chemical denaturations indicates the lack of secondary and tertiary structures. Although such absence is one of the features to assess protein disorder, it could be argued that non- sigmoidal denaturation curves are also due to non-cooperative transitions. However, it would be highly unlikely that non-cooperative transitions for the same protein were observed in chemical and thermal denaturations.
Thermal denaturations of NUPR1L at several pH values (3.0, 5.5, 7.0, 8.4 and 13.0) were carried out by following the changes in the intrinsic fluorescence. At all pH values explored, we did not observe any sigmoidal transition, and protein precipitation was observed at acidic pH. Thermal denaturations of isolated NUPR1 do not show any sigmoidal transition. We also tried to follow the denaturation of NUPR1L in the presence of urea by excitation either at 280 or 295 nm. However, as it happened with the thermal denaturations, no sigmoidal curves were observed at any of the two excitation wavelengths. A similar behaviour has been reported in the chemical denaturations of isolated NUPR.
We acquired a 1D 1H NMR spectrum at very low NUPR1L concentration (9 μM, in protomer units) at pH 8.0, in the presence of 500 mM NaCl and 1 mM β-ME. In the up-field region of the spectrum, all the methyl protons appeared clustered around 0.9 ppm, as they are expected in a polypeptide chain devoid of rigid secondary and tertiary structures. On the other hand, in the amide region a very low signal intensity was observed and very broad peaks were detected (the sharp peaks are due to the aromatic protons of the His-tail (around 8.5 ppm) and the presence of protons of the bases of deoxy-oligonucleotides); furthermore, no signal, around 10.20 ppm, was observed for the indole moiety of Trp62, where it should be observed for a disordered polypeptide chain [61]. These results can be explained as due to: (i) the presence of slow-to-intermediate conformational exchange in NUPR1L involving such aromatic ring, which broadens the signal; or alternatively, (ii) signal broadening due to presence of large molecular weight species. The latter explanation agrees with the experimental observation that Trp62 was involved in the self-association equilibrium of NUPR1L as shown by the quenching results. Then, the NMR indicates that NUPR1L was a disordered protein.
We have shown that NUPR1L was capable of interacting with the same partners of NUPR1, namely, prothymosin α and C-RING1B. However, while the affinity for prothymosin α was the same, within the uncertainty, for both protein isoforms, in the case of C-RING1B the apparent affinity of NUPR1L was smaller (i.e., larger Kd) compared to that of NUPR1: 60 μM versus 10 μM. This difference is due to the self-association of NUPR1L, since the reported constants should include the dissociation of both C-RING1B and NUPR1L, unless the complex involves the formation of a higher-order state between the oligomeric species of both proteins, in which case the real affinity between the two proteins must be lower.
The sequence-based analysis of PtkA (30.6kDa, 291 amino acids) predicts a high disorder tendency for the N- terminal part comprising 80 amino acids. Our NMR data confirm the prediction, showing that PtkA consists of a well-folded kinase core domain (KCD) and an intrinsically disordered domain (IDD). The 2D-(1H,15N)-TROSY spectrum of the full-length PtkA shows in total 231 out of 270 expected amide resonances. Two subsets of signals can be clearly observed: (i) a set of well dispersed peaks, typical for a well-folded structure, and (ii) another set of signals with high intensity, which are clustered in the center of spectrum (8.5-7.7 ppm 1Hppm), indicative of unstructured regions within the full-length PtkA.
We characterized the structure of PtkA and investigated its interactions with MptpA in detail using NMR spectroscopy. The structural architecture of PtkA deviates from other bacterial kinases, as it contains an N-terminal intrinsically disordered domain (IDD), which is linked to the well- folded kinase core domain (KCD). The dynamic properties of both domains are very different and suggest the possibility of an inter- domain controlled regulation of PtkA activity. The IDD is unstructured and highly dynamic, allowing for a “fly-casting” like mechanism of transient interactions with the rigid KCD. This interaction thereby regulates the accessibility of the KCD active site (which is involved in auto- phosphorylation). The decrease of the PtkA activity in presence of IDD suggests an inhibitory effect of the disordered domain during the auto- phosphorylation. Spin label studies indicated the existence of residual long-range transient interactions of the IDD with the KCD.
The structure covering the WD40 domain part of human PRFP19 (residues 169–504 ) has been solved. Residues 169-194 was invisible in the structure.
Structure and Dynamics of an Intrinsically Disordered Protein Region
That Partially Folds upon Binding by Chemical-Exchange NMR
The first 40 residues of MYPT11-98, the disordered region, are intrinsically disordered and highly dynamic
The most prominent structural feature of the MYPT1(1-98) ensemble is a 25% populated transient α-helix in the disordered region of MYPT1(1-98). This α-helix becomes fully populated when bound to PP1 and, as we show, likely plays a central role in the formation of the MYPT1-PP1 holoenzyme complex.
Using size exclusion chromatography, we observed a low level of compactness for ASPP2331–692, indicative of an extended conformation of this domain, typical of intrinsically disordered proteins.
We also analyzed ASPP2331–692 by far-UV CD and observed a spectrum that consisted mainly of a minimum at 200 nm, indicative of a high content of unstructured protein .
An Intrinsically Disordered Region in the Proapoptotic ASPP2 Protein Binds to the Helicobacter pylori Oncoprotein CagA
Finally, we analyzed ASPP2331–692 by NMR spectroscopy. The HSQC-TROSY spectrum of 15N-labeled ASPP2331–692 exhibited a pattern typical for disordered proteins (Figure 2E), in which the observed resonances of the amide protons are dispersed in a narrow cluster ranged from δ1H 7.7 to 8.5 ppm (Δ = 0.8 ppm), unlike wider distributions typical for structured proteins.
An Intrinsically Disordered Region in the Proapoptotic ASPP2 Protein Binds to the Helicobacter pylori Oncoprotein CagA
The ASPP2 Pro domain eluted earlier than predicted from its molecular mass, and its apparent molecular mass estimated from the calibration curve was ∼130,000 Da (Fig. 2A), a value five times higher than the theoretical value of 24,500 Da. This early elution in the gel filtration may be attributed to an extended or unfolded native structure of the protein (39) or to putative oligomerization.
To determine the basis for the early elution of ASPP2 Pro in the gel filtration experiments, we analyzed its secondary structure using CD spectroscopy. The far-UV CD spectrum of the recombinant purified protein exhibited a minimum at only ∼200 nm (Fig. 3A), suggesting a highly unstructured conformation.
Additionally, a stretch of
37 residues between helix C and strand d (from 109 to 146) is
also disordered in the crystal. This region contains the predicted
nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence PGRKRKW
and two putative phosphorylation site serine residues (Ser-109
and Ser-136)
SopB was quickly digested to a 40 KDa protease-resistant fragment. This resistant fragment was identified by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectroscopy. It starts at residue E149. Thus the ~150 first residues of SopB are accessible to protease and may contain the Chaperone Binding Domain (CBD) of SopB.
For the CBD alone we obtained values of Rg (26.3–28.7 Å) and Dmax (125 Å) larger than those obtained with the chaperone alone, suggesting a partially disordered structure. The corresponding Kratky plot showed an elevated baseline at high q values, confirming the typical elongated shape consisting of a globular part appended by a disordered region.
The N-terminal Chaperone Binding Domain (CBD) of SopB has been shown to be implicated in many aspects of the infection cycle by interacting with several different protein partners and that those interactions are crucial for SopB activity: interaction with SigE in bacteria cytosol, Cdc42 and ubiquitination enzymes in the host cell.
After translocation into the eukaryotic cell, together with effectors SopE and SopE2, SopB interferes with cellular functions by activating the host Rho GTPase Cdc42.
The structure of the N-terminal domain of SopB (residues 29–181) in complex with Cdc42 has recently been solved. Analysis of this structure shows no electronic density for residues from 29 to 45 and 171 to 181 suggesting that these fragments don't have a stable conformation in the complex.
Analysis of this structure shows no electronic density for residues from 29 to 45 and 171 to 181 suggesting that these fragments don't have a stable conformation in the complex.
Residues 1-54, 202-211, and 357-379 were not observed or were poorly defined by the electron density.
A fragment (residues 126–147, including several highly conserved residues) is severely disordered, except for in chain B of an alternative substrate-free structure (PDB ID code 5UNM), where it folds into an extended loop
The σ54(106-269) peaks are well-dispersed and nearly all of them overlay with a peak in the σ54(1-269) spectrum. The extra peaks in the σ54(1-269) construct, which must correspond to the first 105 residues of E.c. σ54, are poorly dispersed and in the region of the spectrum that corresponds to unfolded residues. Other constructs of E.c. σ54 were also studied, including the full length protein (residues 1-477), the AID-linker-4 helix bundle σ54(1-186), the AID alone σ54(1-62), and a segment of the AID alone σ54(11-48). In all of these the pattern of poorly dispersed peaks associated with the AID, with 1H shifts between 8 and 9 ppm, occurs.
A segment of the AID drives complex formation with the activator ATPase domain NtrC1C in its ATP state.
We performed similar experiments with full length 15N-labeled E.coli σ54 and RNA polymerase. With excess core RNAP present most of the peaks corresponding to the AID and linker are broadened. The ~10 remaining peaks likely correspond to the N-terminal residues before the start of, and possibly including, the N-terminal helix of the AID. So the σ54 AID is an unstructured, intrinsically disordered domain in σ54 alone, with most of it becoming ordered when in complex with core polymerase.
The spectrum of TAF4N/C was represented by a large minimum at 205 nm, suggesting that the molecule was largely disordered. However, a careful observation revealed that the spectrum showed a small, but significant shoulder at approximately 220 nm. This suggests that some part of TAF4N/C may adopt an α‐helical conformation. Nevertheless, the spectra indicated that most of the molecule was largely disordered, consistent with NMR observations.
From the Guinier plot the Rg value for TAF4N/C was estimated to be 49.0 ± 7.4 Å. Although this was significantly smaller than that is expected for the urea‐denatured state of a protein with 431 amino acid residues (∼70 Å) it is consistent with the CD spectrum, suggesting possible formation of α‐helical structure in some parts of TAF4N/C. The Kratky plot did not show any clear peaks, suggesting that the protein is largely disordered.
All resonance peaks were poorly dispersed along the 1H chemical shift axis and appeared within the range of 8.5 and 7.5 ppm, indicating that the protein had neither secondary nor tertiary structures that were stabilized by regular hydrogen bonds and the rigid packing of side chains. This result suggests that the central region of TAF4, which contains all the Q‐domains, is intrinsically disordered under physiological conditions.
Biochemical and genetic approaches have shown that the promoter‐specific transcriptional activator Sp1 has the ability to interact with one of the components of TFIID, the TBP‐associated factor TAF4. Quantitative analysis of the interaction between the disordered Q‐domains of Sp1 and TAF4 by NMR and surface plasmon resonance showed a weak but specific association between them.
The spectra of region 201-268 (W7) in the <210 nm range resemble those expected for a random coil conformation.
The CRIB/GBD motif of WASP mediated binding to Cdc42.
The binding of Cdc42 induces a structural rearrangement of residues in the GBD/CRIB motif, or alternatively, the Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein fragments have an ensemble of conformations, one of which is stabilized by Cdc42 binding.
Short and medium range NOEs were analyzed to characterize the secondary structure of W7. Surprisingly, considering the tight binding of W7 to Cdc42, amino acid regions in the N-terminal part of W7 including the GBD/CRIB motif itself do not show any obvious secondary structure. Only the region from Trp-252 to Asp-264 shows NOEs typical of an α-helical conformation.
The CD curve of WIP-N (res2-101) exhibits a minimum at 195 nm and a weak shoulder at 220 nm, characteristic features of an unstructured protein.
WIP interacts with actin through its N‐terminal domain that contains two canonical actin binding motifs (ABMs).
For the ABM the disordered to folded transition involves a gain of stabilizing interactions with actin at the price of a decrease in its entropy; by partially mirroring the future bound state the ABM can limit this entropic loss and increase its binding affinity.
One- and two-bond J(15N,13Cα) couplings were acquired for WIP residues 2-65 at various temperatures, and in denaturing and crowding environments. Under native conditions fitted J-couplings identified in the WIP conformational ensemble a propensity for extended conformation at residues 16-23 and 45-60, and a helical tendency at residues 28-42. These findings are consistent with a previous study of the based upon chemical shift and RDC data and confirm that the WIP2-65 conformational ensemble is biased towards the structure assumed by this fragment in its actin-bound form.
The comparison between the 2D 1H‐15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum and the 2D in‐phase anti‐phase (IPAP) 13C‐15N (CON) spectrum of WIP-N further corroborates our identification of WIP-N as a disordered domain. The CON spectrum displays significantly advantageous spectral dispersion which is characteristic of disordered proteins. As expected, secondary chemical shifts in WIP-N are generally small, in the ±0.5 p.p.m. range. However, they are revealing in that they identify structural tendencies in the disordered state of WIP-N or regions for which the multi‐conformational average differs from random coil. In both prediction methods residues 30–42 exhibit a helical propensity, and residues 45–62 demonstrate a β‐strand propensity. Furthermore, a third region with β‐strand structural propensity, albeit lower than that of residues 45–62, is clearly revealed for residues 17–25. The ensemble‐based analysis of RDCs confirms our previous results, finding that in WIPN the multi‐conformational average for the N‐terminal ABM exhibits the characteristic helix‐β‐strand motif, and that it is preceded by an additional segment with β‐strand structural propensity. In addition, it shows that the ABM does not exhibit tertiary structure or even partial long‐range order and should be considered as an array of independent structural elements.
Regions that were most protected from solvent exchange, exhibiting negligible recovery after 20 ms, included residues 440–468, spanning the rigid VCR domain, and residues 475–479, both consistent with structural elements delineated by chemical-shift data. Low protection factors identified increased flexibility in two regions of WIPC, residues 470–474 and 481–490, which exhibited recovery rates of 5–10% and 10–25%, respectively.
The transiently structured regions are connected by unstructured linker segments, as could be deduced from minimal secondary structure, low transverse relaxation and hetNOE rates, minimal IRCS values, and exposure to solvent exchange.
WASp-interacting protein (WIP) acts as the cellular chaperone of WASp, conveys WASp to areas of active actin assembly after antigen-receptor and chemokine receptor signaling (3,4), and stabilizes WASp by shielding it from cellular degradation systems. The C-terminal segment of WIP contains the verprolin conserved region (VCR; residues 444–478) that is capable of binding the N-terminal EVH1 domain of WASp.
WASp-interacting protein (WIP) acts as the cellular chaperone of WASp, conveys WASp to areas of active actin assembly after antigen-receptor and chemokine receptor signaling (3,4), and stabilizes WASp by shielding it from cellular degradation systems. The C-terminal segment of WIP is capable of binding  and chaperoning the N-terminal EVH1 domain of WASp.
One such region of interest is the phosphorylation site of residues 484–492, whose flexibility is consistent with its need to be sufficiently exposed to allow access to the phosphorylating enzyme PKCθ.
Thus, contributing to the formation of the WIP/WASp complex are preformed motifs at residues 462–465 and 474–478, and a third motif (residues 457–461) whose structure is formed only in the presence of WASp.
The protein eluted from the SEC column at a volume corresponding to an apparent molar mass of 28 kDa. The mass derived from MALS data is 11.7 kDa, however, demonstrating that Kiss1 is monomeric. These inconsistent results indicate that Kiss1 is either folded with an elongated shape, or flexible and disordered.
The low dispersion of the backbone 1HN chemical shifts observed in the HSQC spectrum indicates that KISS1 is largely disordered and flexible under native conditions. Analysis of chemical shift deviations and 15N T2 relaxation times does not provide clear evidence for any conformational preference, suggesting that KISS1 behaves as a random coil polypeptide.
After secretion KISS is processed by the furin endoprotease. This enzyme recognizes dibasic cleavage sites on the amino acid sequence and, after the action of carboxypeptidases and peptidyl-glycine-α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), generates a fragment of 54 residues known as Kisspeptin54 (KISS1 residues 68–121). Kisspeptin54 can be further cleaved into smaller 14, 13 and 10 residue fragments, or kisspeptins, which are ligands of the seven-transmembrane helix G protein-coupled receptor GPR54, also named KISS1R.
Phosphorylated at residue Y110.
C-terminal amidation by peptidyl-glycine-α-amidating monooxygenase.
KISS1 and its fragments interact with KISS1R, their GPCR receptor.
The thermal denaturation curve of Kiss1 followed by the changes in the CD signal at 222 nm does not show any cooperative folding-unfolding transition, indicating that KISS1 lacks a defined tertiary structure.
The far-UV CD spectrum of Kiss1 shows a minimum at 198 nm and a shoulder at 226 nm, consistent with a predominantly random-coil protein with little secondary structure.
The Kratky representation is typical for a disordered protein, with a monotonic increase of I(s)s2 with the momentum transfer s. An analysis of the smallest angle data by Guinier’s approach for a momentum transfer range s·Rg < 1.3 (where Rg is the radius of gyration) indicates that KISS1 has an average radius of gyration of 34.7 ± 0.5 Å. This value is slightly larger than expected for an IDP of 120 residues (RgRC = 30.1 Å), suggesting that KISS1 could transiently adopt more extended structures.
The narrow chemical shift dispersion in the 1H dimension of the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum, suggests that the KLF41–130 fragment is intrinsically disordered. Analysis using the secondary structure propensity (SSP) algorithm (Marsh et al. 2006) indicates that most of KLF41–130 is disordered, however there are two continuous regions with >20% helical propensity spanning residues Asn42-Met51 and Asp104-His115 (Fig. 2). 
Chemical shift index predictions of secondary structure and the lack of medium- and long-range NOE connectivities observed in the 1H–15N NOESY-HSQC and 1H-13C-NOESY spectra are consistent with the prediction of an intrinsically disordered structure for the Cx37CT.
The CT plays a role in the trafficking, localization, and turnover of gap junction channels, as well as the level of gap junction intercellular communication via numerous post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions.
The CT plays a role in the trafficking, localization, and turnover of gap junction channels, as well as the level of gap junction intercellular communication via numerous post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions.
Analysis of the 15N-NOESY spectra did not produce NOEs consistent with any secondary structure. The intrinsically disordered structure for the soluble Cx32CT domain as determined by CD is consistent with the narrow 1H chemical shift dispersions (<1 ppm) observed in the 15N-HSQC.
Cx32CT domain interacts with the protein partners synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97) and calmodulin (CaM).
The soluble Cx32CT showed a peak minimum near 198 nm and little ellipticity at 222 nm, characteristic of a flexible, intrinsically disordered protein.
The backbone and sidechain resonances were assigned using three-dimensional NMR spectra of the monomer, following standard procedures. Solely, the prolines, the C-terminal His6-tag and three residues at the N terminus remained unassigned. Eventually, 79% of protons and more than 69% of heteroatoms could be assigned. The structure was calculated with a total number of 1027 NOE restraints out of which 12% could be assigned to long range distance restraints. The structure of CsgF consists of three independent elements: An N-terminal unstructured region, a 21-residue a-Helix and a C-terminal antiparallel b-sheet made of four strands. Almost all long range restraints were found to deﬁne the b-sheet. The bundle of the lowest energy structures demonstrates that no unique arrangement between the three regions could be determined due to the absence of interdomain NOE restraints.
Thermal stability is a key feature of mostly disordered proteins. Due to their specific amino acid composition and their inherent lack of structure, no aggregation occurs at high temperatures. According to our expectations, the level of intact hNopp140 has not changed after 10 min of boiling, while the globular control BSA aggregated and
precipitated.
The spectrum of hNopp140 has a characteristic peak with a minimum at 203 nm tending to disappear at 220 nm. This resembles the CD spectrum of IDPs that are characterized with a minimum at 200 nm, and an approximately zero value at 220 nm.
Previously it was shown that the phosphorylated form of hNopp140 preferentially binds to CK2, suppressing the catalytic activity of the enzyme. This enzyme is highly conserved in eukaryotes and is implicated in cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. In fact, CK2 was found to be primarily responsible for extensive phosphorylation of hNopp140.
Protease sensitivity is another important marker of disordered proteins, because their extended structure makes them fully accessible to the action of proteases. In accord, hNopp140 proved to be highly sensitive to proteolysis which is another piece of evidence underlining its disordered status. The level of intact BSA has hardly changed in the
time-scale used in our experiment, while hNopp140 was degraded promptly by both proteinase K and trypsin. After only 30 s there was practically no detectable hNopp140 left,while the level of BSA stayed stable even after 1 min
As further evidence for the absence of folded structure, the proton 1D spectrum is concentrated to a relatively narrow ppm region. The reason for this is that the similar chemical environment of the protons in the same chemical group results in very similar chemical shifts. The proton 1D spectrum of globular proteins spreads over a much wider
range due to the very big differences in the local magnetic environments. 1H-NMR spectra of hNopp140 is characterized by line narrowing and lack of resonance dispersion typical of a disordered protein.
Most serine residues are phosphorylated by casein kinase 2 (CK2), which makes hNopp140 one of the most highly phosphorylated proteins in the cell with approximately 80 phosphates per molecule. Several other kinases such as PKA, PKC and cdc2 kinase, are able to phosphorylate Nopp140 underlining the importance of the phosphorylation in the regulation of the function of the protein and it was also shown that PKA and not CK2 phosphorylation was necessary for the rat Nopp140 to be able to activate agp gene expression.
Protein disorder also manifests itself in other physical characteristics, such as aberrant mobility in gel filtration. Most IDPs elute at two to six times higher molecular weight than their actual size. The apparent molecular weight of hNopp140 extrapolated from the data of four protein standards is 511.0 kDa in contrast to the 75.58 kDa
calculated from its amino acid sequence, resulting in an apparent molar weight 7 times higher than the actual size of the molecule.
The hydrodynamic radius of hNopp140 was also determined in this
experiment and gave a result of 5.7 nm. Based on the classification of
unfolded proteins according to their compactness [42], hNopp140 falls
somewhere between random coil and premolten globule, but it is closer
to the latter category (Fig. 3B).
Triple-resonance NMR spectra showed significant peak-broadening in the N-terminal region of both variants, as also reported in a recent NMR analysis of RCD1-RST468-589 (Tossavainen et al., 2017).
Although sequential assignment was possible in the free state, structure elucidation was impeded by general peak-broadening, particularly in the N-terminal region.
This  suggests  that  the  flanking  regions induce  a  conformational  state  mimicking  the  bound  state.  In  support  of  this,  amide  CSPs  of  RCD1-RST487-589 correlated well with those of DREB2A-bound RCD1-RST499-572, when using unbound RCD1-RST499-572 as reference (Fig. 1D, top, S1A, Pearson’s r = 0.84).
The amide resonances of this variant overlapped with those of RCD1-RST487-589 confirming the C-terminal tail as the source of the induced changes (Fig. 1C).
They reported the crystal structure at 1.75 Å resolution of a complex between CnrH and the cytosolic domain of CnrY (CnrYc peptide).  Mass spectrometry analyses identified products matching the CnrYc peptide (residues 2-38). The structure of CnrH:CnrYc shows that CnrYc has no hydrophobic core.
"The lack of a hydrophobic core in CnrYc suggests that the cytosolic domain of CnrY is intrinsically unfolded"
The crystall structure of CnrH ( residues 5–91 and 123–189) and CnrYc (residues 2–30) has been solved.
CnrH inhibition by CnrYc.
"CnrYc stabilizes a conformation of CnrH that cannot bind the promoter − 10 element and it occludes the RP core-binding determinants on σ2 and σ4."
"The final 1.75-Å-resolution model consists of residues 5–91 and 123–189 of CnrH, and in residues 2–30 of CnrY"
Electron density is not discernible for part of the SCD1 domain (residues
1−14), part of the loops of the FHA1 domain (residues 79−86 and 135−137), the linker region between the FHA1 and kinase domains (residues 165−190), part of the activation segment (residues 344−356)

No discernable electron density was observed for a number of loop regions, including the N-terminal 21 residues preceding the kinase domain (170 to 190), residues 347 to 357 of the activation segment, residues 369 to 381 of loop alphaEF-alphaF, and the C-terminal 16 residues (497 to 512).

The crystal structure reveals a head-to-tail, face-to-face mode of dimerization that is necessary for autophosphorylation of Thr354 on the Rad53 activation loop, as confirmed by in vitro and in vivo functional analyses.

Furthermore, it is also lacking of any tight

narrow spectral dispersions on both 1H and 15N dimensions
In the present study, we first experimentally demonstrate that
the N-terminal regulatory domain sufficient for auto-inhibiting
PAK4 and binding Cdc42 isintrinsically unstructured.
As judged from its far-UV spectrum with the maximal negative
signal at 201 nm (Fig. 1B), the domain is predominantly
unstructured in the free state, without any stable secondary
structures
The A43 tip loop is flexible in the crystal structure (Figures 3B and S4), but is likely folded upon binding to the Pol I core.
Here, we report the resolution of the 3D structure of full-length JCV agnoprotein by NMR, which not only confirmed the existence of the previously reported major α-helix domain at the same position but also revealed the presence of an additional minor α-helix region spanning amino acid residues Leu6 to Ala10. The remaining regions of the protein adopt an intrinsically unstructured conformation.
Average structure of agnoprotein contains two α-helical structures Leu6- Lsy13 and Arg24-Phe39 (colored green) and two principal unstructured regions spanning residues Val14-Lys23 and Cys40-Thr71 (colored red).

Agnoprotein contains several potential phosphorylation sites, including Ser7, Ser11, and Thr21, which are potential targets for the serine/threonine-specific protein kinase C (PKC). In this study, we investigated the functional significance of these phosphorylation sites for the activity of agnoprotein. In vitro and in vivo kinase assays demonstrated that agnoprotein is a target for phosphorylation by PKC. In addition, each of the PKC phosphorylation sites was mutated to Ala singly and in combination, and the effects of these mutations on the JCV life cycle were analyzed.
Evidence corresponding to Thr21.
Agnoprotein phosphorylation mutants were unable to sustain infection cycle.
As shown in Fig. ​Fig.3A,3A, as expected, WT virus replicated efficiently during the infection cycle, and its level of replication increased gradually but significantly toward 21 day posttransfection (lanes 2 to 4). However, it was surprising that all three phosphorylation mutants of agnoprotein showed replication only during the early phases of infection cycle (lanes 5, 8, and 11) and were unable to sustain replication cycles at later time points. It was also evident from our results that mutation at Thr21 alone or those at Ser7 and Ser11 were sufficient to cause this effect.
In the present study, we investigated the functional importance of phosphorylation sites of agnoprotein (Ser7, Ser11, and Thr21) by genetic and biochemical approaches and demonstrated that the phosphorylation of respective target sites on agnoprotein by PKC (Ser7, Ser11, and Thr21) is critical for virus propagation.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that agnoprotein is phosphorylated by PKC and viruses containing phosphorylation mutants of agnoprotein do not propagate after the first round of the infection cycle.
Evidence corresponding to Thr21.
Disordered in the Rpb4/7 structure are the Rpb7 tip loop (residues 57– 68)
The Rpb7 tip domain binds to the Pol II core with the helical turn K1 and with the highly conserved “tip loop,” which is disordered in the free Rpb4/7 structure but folds upon core binding.
Figure 2D. Calpha secondary chemical shifts of Dss1 confirm the predominantly disordered structure.
Dss1 is intrinsically disordered with a single, transiently populated alpha helix from F55 through K66.
Titration analyses with increasing amounts of ubiquitin disclosed the strongest binding to ubiquitin by binding site I (UBS-I), which is located at D38-D49 and disclosed the second and weakest site, UBS-II, located at D16-N25.
Comparison of the NMR peak intensities of 15N-Dss1-N71C with and without MTSL indicated transient long-range effects from the C-terminal spin label (N71C) to regions >30 residues away. Thus, the C terminus was observed to be close to binding site I (BS-I) as well as to the linker between BS-I and BS-II (Figures 1C and S1C).
Because the PREs, the chemical shifts effects, and the population of the helix are all less than maximal, the helix of Dss1 is not tightly anchored but rather forms a “cloud” that dynamically shields access to the helix itself and to BS-I (Figure 1E). Such equilibrium between open and closed conformations may have consequences for how, and to which extent, the binding sites in Dss1 are available.
For wild-type Dss1, GFP-Dss1 preparations were enriched in 263 proteins (Figure S3B).
Comparison of the GFP-Dss1 and GFP-Dss1Δhelix interactomes revealed that most interactions (Figures S3D–S3F) occurred independently of the helix (Figure 2D, green points). This agrees with previous reports that most binding to Dss1 is confined to the disordered region (Kragelund et al., 2016).
We included the highly multispecific yeast protein DSS1wt, which has a high κ-value, indicating regions of repetitive charged residues of the same charge. In this case, we found two regions of higher CSPs, one between residues S8 to D14, and one between residues T39 to N43 (Figure 1D). Although these regions had the highest CSP, we observed generally high CSPs throughout the protein, i.e., S8–D14, D18–E32, and T39–N43. 
DSS1wt binds calcium at a higher ratio of 1:4 (Figure 1G,I), which may cause overlap within the regions with high CSPs. The overall affinity of DSS1wt for calcium was measured to be ~70 μM (Figure 1H). 
We next acquired DOSY spectra for DSS1wt and its mutants, finding that both DSS1wt and DSS1D became more compact upon calcium binding (25.7% and 17.6%, respectively).
S5a (196-306) contains three a-helices that are connected by flexible regions.
S5a (196-306) contains three well-structured regions spanning residues P214-E245, D257-E269, and L278-Q296 (Figure 1(b)–(e)). Flexible, randomly coiled linker regions connect the structured elements and prevent them from being defined relative to each other. This lack of higher-order structure within these regions is supported by their chemical-shift assignments,26 lack of long-range nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) interactions, and NMR relaxation data (data not shown).
Between the UIMs of S5a is a second α-helix with flexible linker regions at either end (Figure 1).

Here, we identify a region at the C-terminal end of hRpn10 that forms a binding site in the proteasome for E6AP. By using biophysical techniques including NMR spectroscopy, we find this region to be disordered when unbound
Comparisons of our NMR data acquired on free and AZUL-bound RAZUL indicate that RAZUL acquires helicity upon binding to AZUL. Carbonyl and Cα values when compared with random coil taking into account amino acid type yields a chemical shift index (CSI) that informs on secondary structure; these values shift to reflect greater helicity for RAZUL when bound to AZUL (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 6b). Moreover, intramolecular interactions characteristic of helicity were observed following AZUL addition, but not for free RAZUL (Supplementary Fig. 6c, d). Overall, our NMR data indicate that RAZUL switches from a poorly ordered state to a well-defined helical state following AZUL binding.
RAZUL binds the AZUL helices from the opposite direction compared with the Zn finger. In this complex, two α-helices are formed in RAZUL that span P332–N341 (α1) and E350–S361 (α2). Directly N-terminal to RAZUL α1 is a single turn of a 3 10 -helix that spans V328-Q330.
RAZUL α1 is centered between the two AZUL helices by hydrophobic interactions involving F334, L335, V338, and L339 as well as L342 and V345 from the RAZUL α1/ α2 loop. From the 3 10 -helix, V328 and M329 form hydrophobic interactions. RAZUL α2 is more peripheral compared with α1, with A351, I352, A355, M356, and L359.
E6AP AZUL binds to hRpn10 RAZUL at the proteasome.

Overall, our NMR data indicate that RAZUL switches from a poorly ordered state to a well-defined helical state following AZUL binding.
CD measurements indicated 7% and 46% helicity, respectively, for unbound RAZUL (blue) and AZUL (green), and a theoretical spectrum (gray dashed line) for the mixture with markedly less spectral features of helicity compared with the recorded experimental spectrum (orange, Fig. 5d). Overall, 35% helicity is indicated from the experimental CD data recorded on the complex, consistent with the 36% helicity determined by NMR (Fig. 5b). The AZUL secondary structure is unaltered by binding to RAZUL (Supplementary Fig. 6a), leading us to conclude that the observed difference between the theoretical and experimental CD spectra reflects increased helicity for RAZUL, consistent with the NMR data (for example, Fig. 5c).

Expression of full-length (lane 7) but not RAZUL-truncated hRpn10 (lane 6) resulted in observable E6AP co-immunoprecipitation with proteasomes isolated from ΔRAZUL cells (Fig. 4a); we attribute the lower amounts of E6AP co-immunoprecipitated with proteasomes of hRpn10full-length-expressing ΔRAZUL cells to the reduced abundance of endogenous E6AP in this cell line, as described above (Fig. 2b). This experiment indicates that the hRpn10 RAZUL recruits E6AP to the proteasome.
To assess the strength of hRpn10(305–377):AZUL interaction, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) with the AZUL added incrementally to hRpn10(305–377); a Kd value of 11.6 + 3.3 nM was measured (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2f), indicating similar strength to hRpn13 interaction with the proteasome.

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) similarly revealed a Kd value of 8.1 + 1.4 nM for GST-hRpn10(305–377) binding to AZUL (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 2g).

The AZUL secondary structure is unaltered by binding to RAZUL (Supplementary Fig. 6a), leading us to conclude that the observed difference between the theoretical and experimental CD spectra reflects increased helicity for RAZUL, consistent with the NMR data (for example, Fig. 5c).
(residues 420 to 451), which is highly flexible ​[Fig.1(A)]. The Cα and Cβ chemical shift values and the sequential and medium range NOEs of the backbone amide protons confirmed that this N-terminal region also contains a well-defined helical structure [residues 431 to 442]
If the unsolved regions in the EspA–CesA complex structure are disordered, the a-helical content of EspA should be 37.5%. This value is highly consistent with the a-helical content estimated here from far-UV CD spectra of EspA at pH 7.0 (39.6%). It is generally considered that the native-like secondary structures are present in the partially folded state of a protein.
EspA is shown to spontaneously associate into oligomeric structures at neutral pH. However, two distinctive partially unfolded species occur at lower pH. Based on these results, a phase diagram, illustrating potential EspA conformational transitions, was constructed.
The experimental electron density map only showed clear density for the N-terminal region (Asp31–Leu59) and the C-terminal region (Leu148–Leu190) of EspA.
CesA is the recently proposed chaperone of EspA,
and we demonstrate that CesA traps EspA in a monomeric state and inhibits its polymerization. Crystallographic analysis of the
heterodimeric CesA–EspA complex at a resolution of 2.8 Å reveals that EspA contains two long -helices, which are involved in
extensive coiled-coil interactions with CesA.

The linker region (residues 217 to 267) is not visible due to structural disordering.
We made a synthetic peptide corresponding to this WH2, comprising amino acids Asp 724 to the C-terminus (Ser 755) of human MIM. The structure of the WH2 of MIM can be conceptually subdivided into two parts, an N-terminal amphiphilic α-helix, comprising amino acids Gly 728 to Gly 738, and a C-terminal extended region from Val 739 to Arg 753.
The crystal structure of this WH2 was determined as a ternary complex with actin-DNase I.
No electron density was
observed for the N-terminal 14 and C-terminal 12 residues, the residues 165 to 172 in Sec13,
and the N-terminal 6 residues of Nup145C. These residues are presumed to be disordered and
therefore have been omitted from the final model

A putative loop L2 (amino

on of the G-domain is not visible in our 
structure.
The 40 
amino acid long loop L4 (residues 532-572) is at

PH domain of dynamin
 and is absent in our model. L4 is 
predicted to be unstructured 
and was previously shown to

Secondary structure analysis by NMR spectroscopy revealed severaltransient helices (THs) in the intrinsically disordered NHE1cdt
Thesewere located at P694-R700 (TH1), P727-G743 (TH2), D758-S766 (TH3), andP786-L795 (TH4), where TH1 and TH4 were rather short and lowly populated.
When presented as a Kratky plot, the SAXS profile of hNHE1 cdt increased throughout its range (Figure 2C), a pattern characteristic for unfolded proteins.
The secondary structure and overall fold analyses of hNHE1 cdt by far-UV CD spectroscopy showed a distinct minimum at ~200 nm and a shoulder at 220-230 nm, indicating the absence of regular secondary structures (Figure 2B).
The Δδircfor the phosphorylated state showed similar proﬁle as for the unphosphorylated state,but with increased helicity for TH4.
To assess whether the local sequence is responsible for the stabilizing eﬀect of phosphorylation and whether it is independent of the nearby T779 phosphorylation we next assigned the NMR chemical shifts of the TH4pepWTwith and without phosphorylation by natural abundance NMR spectroscopy.
Finally, the [1H, 15N]-HSQC NMR spectrum of hNHE1 cdt showed a significant lack of dispersion in the proton dimension (Figure 2D), demonstrating in unison with the other data that the regulatory distal domain of NHE1 is intrinsically disordered.
While for all variants, including the WT peptide, the ellipticity at 190 nm increased uponphosphorylation, indicating less disorder, the negative ellipticity at 222 nm,indicating an increase in helicity, was only increased for the WT and theD784A variants. 
change at 222 nm clearly indicated R790 to be important for conferring the phosphorylation-induced helix stabilisation.
We found that the Rh of NHE1 reduced more severely by ~8 Å (25.6%) upon calcium addition (Figure 4C), again related to the position of the binding site at mid-sequence.
These data suggest that in some cases, the position of the Ca2+-binding site can affect the extension of the IDP by inducing a conformational shift, seen here for both NHE1 and ANAC046
NHE1680-815 similarly bound calcium at a 1:1 ratio (Figure 1G,I), again with micromolar affinity (~130 μM; Figure 1H).
Subsequently, we used the C-terminal disordered tail of the sodium-proton exchanger 1 (NHE1680-815) to address the interaction between calcium and a protein with high negative charge at the center of the sequence, finding that this was indeed the region (S745–S766) with the highest CSPs (Figure 1C).

residues of Tah1 (residues 92–111) are unstructured

Tah1 folds upon interaction with Pih1.
the
short unstructured C-terminal region of Tah1 was sufficient to
bind Pih1 and the strength of the interaction was similar to that
for full-length Tah1.
Most residues in the structures have a good electron density and are traced without ambiguity, except for disordered residues 128–145, 395–406, and 436–445 in subunit A and residues 131–146, 209–217, 395–408, and 435–446 in subunit B in both structures. In addition, residues 89–100 in the PDE5A89 structure are disordered.

Residues 840–850 of the M-loop have not been modeled due to disorder and are indicated by a dotted line
The NMR structure of DENV-2 C protein (PDB ID: 1R6R) reveals a homodimer that contains a well-folded core domain (residues 21–100) and a conformationally labile N-terminal region (residues 1–20), which is absent from the reported coordinates.
The N-terminal tails of the DENV C protein are essential for efficient viral particle formation as well as for recognition of different ligands during the life cycle of the virus
The secondary structure of DEN2C is composed of four alpha helices. The most N-terminal helix (helix I, amino acids 26 to 31) is followed by a 14-residue loop and a second helix (helix II, amino acids 45 to 55). Helix II contains the start of an internal hydrophobic region that has been previously implicated in membrane association (underlined residues of DEN2C sequence in Fig. ​Fig.4B).4B). Following helix II is a loop region (amino acids 56 to 62) that is followed by helix III (amino acids 63 to 69) and then a fourth short loop region (amino acids 70 to 73). The longest helix in DEN2C (helix IV) occurs at the C terminus of the protein (amino acids 74 to 96). The N terminus of DEN2C (amino acids 1 to 21) does not appear to possess secondary structure.
The alpha-helical nature of the C protein was confirmed experimentally by far-UV circular dichroism (CD). The far-UV CD spectra of both YFC and DEN2C demonstrated characteristics of alpha-helical proteins with local minima at 222 and 208 and a maximum at 190 nm (data not shown). In addition, the far-UV CD spectra for DEN2CΔ1-13 was essentially identical to that for DEN2C, indicating that removal of the first 13 residues did not significantly perturb the secondary structure of DEN2C (data not shown).
The Hα chemical shift changes promoted by the presence of LDs were quantified, showing that the highest changes occurred for the resonances of Asn1, Met2 and Leu3.
To evaluate whether binding of pep14–23 to LDs was also dependent on a surface protein, LD limited proteolysis was performed before zeta potential measurements. As previously observed for C protein, LD trypsinization eliminated the ability of pep14–23 to interact with LDs (Figure 4).
Authors show this fragment binds to an unidentified  protein present in lipid droplets from BHK cells.
Mass spectrometry analysis of dissolved NS5MTaseDV crystals showed that the C-terminus missing in the structure is present in the crystallized protein. Thus, the C-terminal part appears to be flexible, probably due to the absence of the polymerase domain of NS5.
As shown in Fig 1A, NS3pro has very similar far-UV CD spectra in Milli-Q water (pH 4.0) and 5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), with the maximal negative signal at 200 nm and no positive signal below 200 nm, which is typical of a predominantly disordered protein without any stable secondary structure.
The NS3pro 14-185 region corresponds to the 1489-1660 region of the polyprotein.
Taken together, CD and NMR results define the 172-residue NS3pro domain to be an intrinsically disordered protein which is lacking of both stable secondary and tertiary structures in the absence of the NS2B cofactor [22,31–36].
Moreover, it has a HSQC spectrum with very narrow spectral dispersions at both 1H (~0.9 ppm) and 15N (~19 ppm) dimensions (Fig 1B), further indicating the absence of tight tertiary packing.

The NS3pro 14-185 region corresponds to the 1489-1660 region of the polyprotein.
The isolated NS3pro (14–185) and NS2B (48–100) are largely disordered in solution (Fig 3A) and the NS3pro alone showed no detectable catalytic activity even with a protease concentration up to 5 μM in buffers at pH 7.5 (Fig 3B). However, upon mixing them at an equal molar ratio in Milli-Q water at pH 4.0, the mixture has a CD spectrum for a protein with a substantial amount of secondary structures, which has a large positive signal at 190 nm and the maximal negative signal at 208 nm (Fig 3A).
The NS3pro 14-185 region corresponds to the 1489-1660 region of the polyprotein.
Unfortunately, HSQC peaks of the NS2B (48–100) are much more broadened than those of NS3pro, implying that the isolated NS2B (48–100) has dynamic aggregation or/and conformational exchanges on the μs-ms time scale, thus preventing from further high-resolution NMR studies
The NS2B 48-100 region corresponds to the 1393-1445 region of the polyprotein.
Interestingly, on the other hand, NS2B (48–100) has a CD spectrum with the maximal negative signal at 206 nm and positive signal at 190 nm, as well as an additional negative signal at 222 nm.
The NS2B 48-100 region corresponds to the 1393-1445 region of the polyprotein.

Full-length Hcn1 was co-crystallized with Cut9; however, only residues 1–24 are clearly visible in the electron density map, and thus the lack of density for residues 25–80 indicates structural disorder.
The Pro56Ser mutation in the human VAPB MSP domain causes a familial amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis.  We have successfully characterized the residue-specific conformation of the Pro56Ser mutant by CD and heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Our study thus implies that the Pro56Ser mutation might lead to ALS by eliminating the native MSP structure.
On the other hand, VAPB(1–150) has a far-UV CD spectrum similar to that of VAPB(1–125) which was previously characterized to adopt a β-dominant MSP fold [46]. This observation implies that the extra C-terminal 25 residues in VAPB(1–150) is largely unstructured and its presence does not alter the MSP-fold.
Furthermore, as shown in Figure 1d, most HSQC peaks of VAPB(1–125) are also superimposable to those of VAPB(1–150), indicating that the C-terminal 25 residues of VAPB(1–150) have no significant packing with the MSP fold assumed by the N-terminal 125 residues [46]. Taken together, CD and NMR results demonstrate that VAPB(1–195) is composed two structural domains, namely the well-folded β-dominant MSP fold and helical VAPB-CC linked by the flexible loop.
The 26 N-terminal residues of CXCR4 did not have interpretable density and are presumed to be disordered

In chains G and H, residues 241–258 and 241–249, respectively, are disordered, compared with residues 243–250 in chain A of pro-TGF-β1 alone (Fig. 3A). However, the positions of ordered residues 240 and 251–261 also differ markedly. Thus, residues 240–261 (22 residues) are capable of remodeling to extend away from pro-TGF-β1 and fit into the PC cleavage site.
To determine whether the two xLIR of TGF-β mediate LC3 interaction, we generated the W17A/V20A, F257A/L260A, and W17A/V20A/F257A/L260A mutants of TGF-β (Supplementary Fig. 7g). TGF-β interaction with recombinant LC3 (His-LC3) was reduced by W17A/V20A or F257A/L260A, and further decreased by W17A/V20A/F257A/L260A (Supplementary Fig. 7g), suggesting that both xLIR motifs are required for efficient LC3 interaction. In vitro experiments using recombinant GST-pro-TGF-β and His-LC3 confirmed their direct interaction, which was disrupted by W17A/V20A/F257A/L260A (Supplementary Fig. 7h).
The annotated region includes the LIR motif (FLLL) at positions 257-260.

The structure of HsP1•HsP2 heterodimer can mainly be divided into two domains–a N-terminal dimerization domain (residue 1–62 of HsP1 and HsP2) and a flexible C-terminal tail, which is composed of the hinge and the highly conserved C-terminal regions (residue 63–114 of HsP1 and 63–115 of HsP2). As a result, the flexible tails of P1•P2 can extend up to ~125 Å away from the N-terminal dimerization domain (Figure 1A).
we propose a model that recruitment of TCS to the sarcin-ricin loop required the flexible C-terminal tail, and the proline-alanine rich hinge region lengthens this C-terminal tail, allowing the tail to sweep around the ribosome to recruit TCS.
The final model is complete with the exception of the disordered Ku70 residues 1–33, 223–230, 533–609 (including the SAP domain), and Ku80 residues 1–5, 171–180, 546–565, plus the disordered final 3 bp of the G-rich stem that occupy a solvent space in the crystal

The C-terminal cytosolic region of NS2B is flexible and disordered as shown by the low NOE values (Figure 2A) of NMR experiments, which corresponds to residues 76-96 of NS2B. Only residues 45-76 are well ordered.
Conversely, residues S48 to D75 of NS2B appear stable in solution, as demonstrated by hetNOE values larger than 0.6 (Fig. 2a).
No electron density is visible for the first 18 amino acids of NS3 protease, indicating that after cleavage the N-terminal region of NS3 protease falls off from its own S′ pocket. Overall, the structure of eZiPro captures the post cleavage state of NS2B-NS3 protease.
We then collected the 15N T1, T2, hetNOE parameters and found that residues including S1-E17 and R170 to E177 of the N- and C-termini of NS3pro are highly dynamic in solution, characterized by low T1 and hetNOE values (<0.6) (Fig. 2a).
Residues V76-V87 of NS2B which form a β-hairpin in the crystal structure, are relatively flexible in solution and exhibit relatively broaden peaks, suggesting a dynamic sampling process of the NS2B cofactor binding to NS3 and forming the P2 pocket (Fig. 1b; Supplementary Fig. 6).

The PDB corresponds to the Uniprot A0A140DLX4 and shows disorder in the region 1503-1516. IDR is 100% identical to this Uniprot and comprises the residues 1499-1512.
The first 15 N-terminal and last 16 C-terminal residues are not visible in the electron density. Due to disorder, parts of loops 1 (residues 340–363), 3 (residues 408–417), 4 (residues 454–471), 5 (residues 533–542) and 6 (residues 576–606) are also missing in the model.

The CD spectrum of NS4A (1–48) is showing a minimum (negative peak) at 199 nm (Fig. 2), and the ellipticity value beyond 199 nm showing no signature peak that suggests missing helices and beta-strands. Shape of the spectrum and signature minima indicating the Far-UV CD spectrum of typically disordered (unstructured or natively unfolded) protein.
The 1-48 region of the NS4A protein corresponds to the 2116-2163 region of the Zika virus polyprotein.
The CD spectrum of NS4A (1–48) peptide is of disordered type as observed in the previous section, but when this peptide is mixed with lipid vesicles (DOPC or DOPS), it displays spectra of a helix (Fig. 5A and B).
While increasing SDS concentration up to 0.5 mM and beyond, a spectral shift was observed at 199 nm and 222 nm, indicating a transition from disordered to α-helix (Fig. 5D).

The SDS micelles further probed the structural transition in NS4A (1–48). SDS is an anionic detergent that, upon interaction, causes a conformational change in many proteins (Blinkhorn and Jones, 1973; Moriyama et al., 2008; Singh et al., 2008).

While 15N-labeled ZIKV NS2B in complex with unlabeled ZIKV NS3pro had a narrowly-dispersed HSQC spectrum with only ~29 peaks detectable (S2B Fig), Dengue NS2B in complex with Dengue NS3pro domain has a well-dispersed HSQC spectrum (S2C Fig) [21,30,31] which unambiguously indicates Dengue NS2B has a tight tertiary packing unlike the Zika one.
The NS2B peptide used corresponds to the 1416-1468 residues of the Zika virus genome polyprotein.
Our NMR results here indicated that only C-terminal residues of ZIKV NS2B remained disordered both in the complex form (Arg73-Lys100; Fig 2E) and in presence of BPTI (Leu86-Lys100; Fig 2F), and the conformation of these C-terminal residues in ZIKV NS2B in these two forms are similar to the uncomplexed form as their HSQC peaks are superimposable (Fig 2C).
The small absolute values of (ΔCα-ΔCβ) chemical shifts over the whole sequence clearly indicate that the isolated Zika NS2B (48–100) lacks stable secondary structure.

Disordered HsCen-2 N-terminal Residues—One aspect missing from the HsCen-2 structure is the sequence of amino acids numbered 1-22 from the N-terminal domain, which were determined to be disordered.
For both the RNA-free and RNA-bound Lsm complexes, the following regions have no clear electron density and are absent in the final atomic models: residues 1–26 and 106–115 of Lsm7. These sequences are all located on the surface and presumably highly flexible.

We were unable to detect density near either copy of the TAF6C homodimer for the N-terminal histone fold domain of TAF6, which forms a heterodimer with the histone fold domain of TAF9.
This result, which suggests that the TAF6 histone fold is flexibly attached and not critical to the structural integrity of the core TFIID, agrees with the finding that the human isoform TAF6δ, which lacks a critical part of its histone fold domain, integrates into an active TFIID complex that retains all TAFs except TAF9.
the C-terminal peptide (314–335) is not visible in the structure and is assumed to be disordered.
There is interpretable electron density for residues 175–189 of Knl1, whereas the rest of the polypeptide chain is presumably disordered in solvent and therefore invisible in the electron density.

Far-UV circular dichroism spectra reveal a predominantly disorder structure of Blinkin peptide S208-K226 in aqueous solutions.
Region 208-226 of the Isoform 2 (identifier: Q8NG31-2), used in this study, corresponds to the 234-252 region of the Isoform 1.
However, the structure reveals that this Blinkin region undergoes a dramatic disorder-to-order transition upon BUBR1 binding, a feature also observed in TFE-titration experiments of Blinkin mimic peptides monitored by circular dichroism (Figure 3C and inset).
Electron density of the Blinkin residues N211-G225 was clearly visible and unequivocally shows that the side chains of Blinkin residues I213, F215, F218, and I219 form part of a short α helix defined by residues F215-T224 (Figure 2D) that runs parallel to the long axis of BUBR1 TPR1 and TPR2.
Region 208-226 of the Isoform 2 (identifier: Q8NG31-2), used in this study, corresponds to the 234-252 region of the Isoform 1. The residues the authors are referring as visible are N237-251.
Nano-ESI MS of synthetic peptides that mimic Blinkin S208-K226 confirm the interaction while peptides harbouring site-specific substitutions indicate the hydrophobic residues I213, F215, F218 and I219 are critical for binding BUBR1.
Region 208-226 of the Isoform 2 (identifier: Q8NG31-2), used in this study, corresponds to the 234-252 region of the Isoform 1. In this sense, residues critical for the interaction are I239, F241, F244 and I245.
The micromolar binding affinity of Blinkin S208-K226 peptide for BUBR157-220 (9.3 μM ± 0.4 in 1:1 stoichiometry) reflects a relatively moderate interaction. Nano-ESI MS and 2D NMR titration data confirmed the 1:1 stoichiometry of the interaction.
The 2.2 Å Crystal Structure of the BUBR1-Blinkin Complex Reveals an Unexpected Mode of Binding
The carboxy-terminal acidic sequence segment of EB1c is disordered beyond Thr249
In free EB1c, the polypeptide segment 194–250 is predominantly structured in solution, whereas the segment 252–268 appears to be flexibly disordered. In complex with APCp1, residues 250–257 of EB1c become ordered (Figure 6B), and chemical shift changes indicate that these residues together with residues 213–225 and 247–249 of the hydrophobic cavity and the polar rim are the major interaction sites (Figure 6C; Figure S7).

no electron density was observed for two N-terminal residues, fourteen C-terminal residues, and eleven residues from two internal disordered regions.
Three regions of the constructed DH fragment were unobservable in the electron density maps: 1) the N-terminal histidine tag and H2362-A2365, (2) the C-terminal residues S2641-G2653, and 3) the loop P2582-G2585.

The main structural feature is an alpha-helix spanning residues 16-24. The rest of the peptide appears to be disordered
A noticeably different CD spectrum is apparent in the filtrate, which shows a strong minimum near 198 nm indicative of a predominantly disordered structure
Oxidation of Met35 thus causes a local and selective disruption of helix 2. In addition to this helix-coil rearrangement in  aqueous micelles, the CD data show that oxidation inhibits a coil-to-sheet transition in water.

this finding suggests a dynamic and disordered structure with a high degree of turns and twists but without a well-defined secondary structure.

The structure is well defined, except for the N terminus (residues 2–8), a segment comprising residues 90–109, and the C terminus (residues 409–425), for which the electron density is unclear due to structural disorder

residues 184–199 do not contribute to the interaction and are disordered in the structure.
Here we present structural evidence for a closed and open conformation of full length CHMP3, which confirms the activated state represented by the CHMP3 crystal structure. Both conformations do not reveal any changes in their secondary structure content or in their overall thermal stability, indicating that a first step in activation entails detachment of the C-terminal module from the N-terminal core.
Human RNA polymerase II CTD heptads 27-52 is predominantly disordered.
Figure 6 clearly shows that only the N-terminal α-helical parts of aIF2β (residues 5–17) retain their positions in all known structures. The conformations of the central parts and zinc-binding domains of aIF2β vary in each structure
Indeed, apart from the first few residues, the structure is well defined up to around residue 35 and does adopt an ICK structure.
The C-terminal region, including Phe44, is disordered.
Thus, even though the regions of conformational space sampled by the families of structures of ι-RXIA and ι-RXIA[l-Phe44] differ slightly in Figure 6, no conclusions can be drawn about the solution conformations of the C-terminal tail containing Phe44 other than that they are disordered in both cases.
A high level of disorder in dLBD is revealed by the limited amide proton chemical shift dispersion in 15N HSQC spectra.
We demonstrate that the long intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of ASCIZ binds LC8 to form a dynamic ensemble of complexes.
The dLBD CD spectrum has a large negative ellipticity at 200 nm, indicating that it is primarily disordered.
We similarly assessed the gel mobility of complexes formed by LC8 and the LC8-binding domain of human ASCIZ (hLBD).
Molecular sieving is the dominate effect on hLBD mobility as both hLBD and dLBD are disordered and highly extended.
hLBD:LC8 complexes form a dynamic ensemble....Titration of the hLBD with LC8 by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig 4d) supports our interpretation of the native gel experiments in Fig 4c.
Together with the CD data, this thus agrees with a model in which the VcHigA2 antitoxin has a well-structured dimeric C-terminal domain, as seen in the crystal structure, and ~36 amino acids long disordered N-terminal segment.
The CD spectrum of the N-terminal region in its native state (attached to the C-terminal domain) was estimated by calculating the difference spectrum between full length VcHigA2 and a truncate (VcHigA2ΔN) consisting of amino acid residues 37–104. The latter protein, which mirrors the residues seen in the crystal structure, is thermodynamically stable and shows a CD spectrum with essentially the same α-helical content as the full length protein (Figure ​(Figure2B). The difference spectrum is similar to the spectrum of the isolated peptide and suggests presence of the random coil structure (gray and blue curves, Figure2B).
The interaction between VcHigA2 and VcHigB2 is characterised by a very high affinity and by structuring of the antitoxin N-terminal domain. Coupled folding and binding is evident from the comparison of the CD spectra from free and the VcHigB2-bound VcHigA2.
Several lines of evidence suggest that the VcHigA2 N-terminal region (residues 1–36), which was not observed in the crystal structure of the free antitoxin, is intrinsically disordered in solution.
The CD spectrum of a peptide encompassing residues Asn3 to Asn33 is typical for a random coil polypeptide with a minimum below 200 nm and a very weak ellipticity above 210 nm.
The minimal element for toxin inhibition is the VcHigA2 peptide encompassing residues Asn3-Glu22, which corresponds to the segment that folds into an α-helix upon toxin binding (see below). Using an in vitro ribosome binding assay we also observe that the VcHigA23-22 peptide prevents VcHigB2 binding to the ribosomes (Figure ​(Figure3B).3B). Thus the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain is sufficient for VcHigB2 toxin regulation.
The dissociation constant of the VcHigB2–VcHigA2 complex is 50 pM.
The negative enthalpy change likely originates from the folding of the N-terminal domain (in particular the formation of an α-helix) and from specific interactions between VcHigB2 and VcHigA2.
The N-terminal region of VcHigA2 folds into an N-terminal α-helix (residues 3–22) followed by a short β-strand (residues 28–37).

MazE  is  an  82-amino  acid  protein  (98amino acids in the used His-tagged construct), but in our crystal structure only 44 residues located in the N-terminal half of the sequence are found ordered. SDS-gel analysis of redissolved crystals nevertheless indicated that in the crystal the protein is intact. Lack of structure of the C-terminal half is thus not a consequence  of  proteolytic  degradation  of  the  sample.  This makes  MazE  a  member  of  the  growing  class  of  intrinsicallyunstructured  proteins  that  become  structured  upon  binding their natural partners. 
Information about the dynamical behavior of both full-length and truncated EcMazEs in their free form was obtained by measuring {1H}-15N steady state NOEs (Supplementary Figure S2). Small and negative {1H}-15N NOEs are indicative of higher flexibility and they are observed mainly for the N-terminal residues (His-tag) and in the disordered C-terminal domain, in agreement with the lack of density in the crystal for the C-terminal tails of full-length EcMazE. Moreover, lack of chemical shift dispersion and high intensity peaks of the C-terminal domain in full-length EcMazE (Figure ​(Figure1B,1B, inset) confirms the high flexibility of this region.
Multiple complementary techniques including
NMR, SAXS and ITC show that the long intrinsically
disordered C-termini in MazE, required for MazF neutralization, does not affect the interactions between
the antitoxin and its operator. Rather, the MazE Cterminus plays an important role in the MazF binding,
which was found to increase the MazE affinity for the
palindromic single site operator
Structures 2MRU and 2MRN are of the MazE 1-50 structured region in isolation and bound to DNA, and were used to derive the disordered state of the C terminal tail in the NMR and SAXS experiments
The major source of variability required for a good agreement with the SAXS data is likely attributed to the flexible C-terminus.
None of the two normalized Kratky return to zero, indicating the presence of highly flexible regions in the scattering particle mainly due to the His-tag in both complexes and increased flexibility is even more present in the full-length EcMazE–DNA ‘a’ complex due to the extended disordered C-terminal tails, missing in the EcMazE1–50–DNA ‘a’ complex.
We determined an accurate structural model of the EcMazE–DNA complex using a combination of NMR and SAXS. This structure is in agreement with previous mutagenesis data and confirms that the C-terminal tail of EcMazE remains disordered and is not directly involved in DNA-binding upon interaction between the N-terminal EcMazE domain with DNA.
Complementary to validating our NMR EcMazE1–50-DNA structure, we aimed to investigate the structural dynamics of the DNA-binding domain and the extended toxin-neutralizing domain in the full-length protein (...) Furthermore, a comparison between the normalized Kratky plots of both EcMazE–DNA complexes (Figure
7D) reveals that the EcMazE1–50-DNA shows diminished internal flexibility compared to full-length EcMazE-DNA. This is in perfect agreement with our NMR relaxation data (Supplementary Figure S2), and can be explained by the absence of the long disordered C-terminal tail in the truncated EcMazE1–50.(....)

The C-terminal region, unstructured in the free form of MazE, becomes structured in complex with toxin MazF.
Interactions between MazE and MazF are primarily mediated by the C 
terminus of MazE, which wraps around the MazF homodimer crossing the edge of the MazF dimer interface and draping primarily over the medial MazF protomer (Figure 2).
MazE (antidote) and MazF (toxin) form a linear heterohexamer composed of alternating toxin and antidote homodimers (MazF(2)-MazE(2)-MazF(2)). The MazE homodimer contains a beta barrel from which two extended C termini project, making interactions with flanking MazF homodimers that resemble the plasmid-encoded toxins CcdB and Kid. The MazE/MazF heterohexamer structure documents that the mechanism of antidote-toxin recognition is common to both chromosomal and plasmid-borne addiction modules, and provides general molecular insights into toxin function, antidote degradation in the absence of toxin, and promoter DNA binding by antidote/toxin complexes.
Numerous van der Waals, polar, and salt-bridge interactions among conserved residues stabilize the conformation of residues 68–76 of MazE as it meanders across the basic underside of the MazF homodimer (Figure 5A).
Site 2 is almost exclusively hydrophobic in nature and represents the most extensive contact interface between MazE and MazF (buried solvent accessible surface area = 1170 Å2, Figure 5B). Residues 54–67 of MazE and three segments of the MazF polypeptide chain support interactions within site 2, including the S3-S4 loop, α helix H1# (# denotes the lateral MazF protomer), and the C terminus of α helix H3 (Figure 1B).
Site 3 interactions between MazE and MazF bury approximately 410 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface areas, and involve residues 48–53 of MazE plus the medial monomer of MazF. Within the site 3 segment of MazE (residues 51–54), Pro 51 and a conserved aromatic residue (Phe53) make van der Waals interactions with α helix H3 (residues Gln100, Leu101, and Ala104) of the medial MazF protomer as the polypeptide chain of the antidote meanders across the hydrophobic surface of the toxin homodimer Figure 4, Figure 5.
However, addition of a variable amount of EcMazF to a lower concentration of EcMazE (1 M), which is not sufficient to cause a shift of the DNA band by itself, results in an increase in affinity for EcMazE to DNA (Figure 3B).(...) Thus, EcMazF enhances the binding of EcMazE to their DNA operator fragment ‘a’ though its interaction with the C-terminal region of EcMazE.
Superposition of our
EcMazE–DNA complex on the crystal structure of the
EcMazE–EcMazF complex (32) (Supplementary Figure
S8C) indicates additional protein–DNA interaction via the
flanking basic regions of the EcMazF homodimer. This favors a model where the enhancement in DNA binding by
EcMazF is caused by co-operative binding of the antitoxin
and toxin to the DNA instead of an allosteric effect
Central in this regulation is an EcMazE-induced double conformational change as follows: a rearrangement of a crucial active site loop and a relative rotation of the two monomers in the EcMazF dimer. Both are induced by the C-terminal residues Asp-78–Trp-82 of EcMazE, which are also responsible for strong negative cooperativity in EcMazE-EcMazF binding
To investigate the interaction between EcMazF and residues Asp-78–Trp-82 of EcMazE, we determined the crystal structure of EcMazFE24A in complex with EcMazE(68– 82). In our structures, Pro-76–Trp-82 forms a -hairpin, the presence of which prevents loop 1-2 of both EcMazF monomers to adopt the catalytically competent conformation and simultaneously blocks both substrate-binding sites on the EcMazF dimer

E24A Mutation Does Not Affect Antitoxin Recognition—We next compared the binding of the intrinsically disordered domain of EcMazE (EcMazE(50– 82)) to EcMazF and EcMazFE24A using ITC (Table 2 and Fig. 6). We find that both EcMazF and EcMazFE24A possess two binding sites for EcMazE(50– 82). Binding is sequential and with strong negative cooperativity. The first EcMazE(50– 82) molecule binds with an affinity around 10 nM, although subsequent binding of the second EcMazE(50– 82) is 3 orders of magnitude weaker. This cooperativity is largely due to the C-terminal EcMazE residues Asp-78–Trp-82 (Table 2 and Fig. 6).

presumably disordered, likely due to their intrinsic flexibility.

Folding of an intrinsically disordered protein by phosphorylation as a regulatory switch
IDPs such as non-phosphorylated 4E-BP2 have intense peaks with narrow 1HN chemical shift dispersion26.
Here we show that multisite phosphorylation induces folding of the intrinsically disordered 4E-BP2, the major neural isoform of the family of three mammalian proteins that bind eIF4E and suppress cap-dependent translation initiation.
We demonstrate that phosphorylation at T37 and T46 induces folding of residues P18–R62 of 4E-BP2 into a four-stranded β-domain that sequesters the helical YXXXXLΦ motif into a partly buried β-strand, blocking its accessibility to eIF4E
We demonstrate that phosphorylation at T37 and T46 induces folding of residues P18–R62 of 4E-BP2 into a four-stranded β-domain that sequesters the helical YXXXXLΦ motif into a partly buried β-strand, blocking its accessibility to eIF4E.
Unlike other IDPs for which phosphorylation only causes downfield chemical shifts of phosphorylated residues27, 4E-BP2 phosphorylation induces widespread downfield and upfield chemical shifts for residues spanning T19–R62, suggesting folding upon phosphorylation (Fig. 1b).

 In its non-phosphorylated state, 4E-BP2 interacts tightly with eIF4E using both a canonical YXXXXLW motif (starting at Y54) that undergoes a disorder-to-helix transition upon binding and a dyna- mic secondary binding site7–11.
ITC (Extended Data Table 2 and Extended Data Fig. 7) and NMR data were obtained on 4E-BP2 variants to probe the role of electrostatics in folding and reducing eIF4E affinity.
Although dimeric Sc-BUB1(29-230) retains the folded state in the pH range of 7 to 10 as shown by far-UV CD, it is predominantly disordered at pH ≤ 5
2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc difference electron density maps showed that Tat-1 and Tat-3 peptides were well lodged in the antigen-binding site of Fab′ (Fig. 2c).
2Fo − Fc and Fo − Fc difference electron density maps showed that Tat-1 and Tat-3 peptides were well lodged in the antigen-binding site of Fab′ (Fig. 2c).
Thus, mAb 11H6H1 recognizes the full-length active Tat and the smaller 15-mer peptide (Tat-1) and 9-mer minimal epitope (Tat-3) with similar affinities, suggesting that the antibody/peptide interaction is close to that observed with the full-length protein. Moreover, the fact that the 9-mer peptide is recognized with the same affinity as the 15-mer peptide suggests that it indeed contains all the residues necessary for the recognition of Tat by 11H6H1. 
The crystal structures of this 9-mer peptide and of an overlapping 15-mer peptide were determined in complex with Fab′ 11H6H1 at 2.4 Å and 2.1 Å resolution, respectively.
The crystal structures of this 9-mer peptide and of an overlapping 15-mer peptide were determined in complex with Fab′ 11H6H1 at 2.4 Å and 2.1 Å resolution, respectively.
Although early NMR structural studies of Tat suggested that Tat was a globular protein devoid of secondary structural elements,19, 20, 21, 22 recent publications have demonstrated that Tat is in fact an intrinsically disordered protein in solution that is able to bind a wide variety of structurally distinct cellular and/or viral biological partners responsible for several biological functions.23, 24 This was further demonstrated by a recent crystallographic study of Tat in complex with the nuclear transcription factor p-TEFb, in which Tat appears elongated, except for short helices around its cysteine-rich domain.
Mass spectroscopy of dissolved crystals confirmed that only the full-length CP12 is contained in the crystals (H.M. and A.K., unpublished observation); therefore, the N-terminal region is largely disordered in the crystal
The GAPDH-CP12 complex structure reveals that the oxidized CP12 becomes partially structured upon GAPDH binding
The results obtained corroborated that both proteins are mostly disordered in solution over a wide range of temperatures (Fig. 2, A and B) and pH (data not shown), with the characteristic negative band for random coil structures around 198 nm.
TFE showed isodichroic points (Fig. 2, C and D), indicating that these proteins are able to adopt two structural conformations in equilibrium under these conditions: one mostly unstructured favored in aqueous solution (U4–2 and U4–5) and a second one with higher helicity promoted by increasing TFE concentrations (F4–2 and F4–5)
the CD analysis indicated that the recombinant AtHIRD11 was disordered because the large negative peak around 200 nm occurred
Full-length CDK2AP1 was analyzed by HDX-MS. The backbone amide groups in the entire N-terminal 60 residues of the protein exhibit rapid HDX rates characteristic of intrinsically disordered polypeptide segments
The far-UV CD spectrum of the NgBR ectodomain owned the largest negative signal at 198 nm and had no positive signal at 190 nm, indicating that it was predominantly unstructured.
It is highly possible that the NgBR cytoplasmic domain becomes well-folded upon binding isoprenyl lipids and/or prenylated proteins.
No significant difference was detected for its near-UV CD spectra in the absence and presence of 8 M urea , suggesting that the no tight tertiary packing existed in the NgBR ectodomain.
It is highly possible that the NgBR cytoplasmic domain becomes well-folded upon binding isoprenyl lipids and/or prenylated proteins.
1H–15N NMR HSQC spectrum of the NgBR ectodomain displayed very narrow spectral dispersions over both dimensions (∼0.75 ppm for 1H and ∼20 ppm for 15N) as well as NMR resonance peaks could be observed for almost all residues. These characteristics indicated that the NgBR ectodomain is highly disordered in the free state
It is highly possible that the NgBR cytoplasmic domain becomes well-folded upon binding isoprenyl lipids and/or prenylated proteins.
Within the X-ray crystallography derived maps, electron
density was not observed for ICP4 residues 258–286, a region
previously predicted to be disordered, with the possible
exception of F283 and T284 in chain
Analysis of 3D TOCSY-HSQC and NOESY-HSQC spectra allowed the amino acid type of 34 sharp backbone amide signals to be determined based on comparison with typical random coil chemical shifts. It was also possible to assign backbone amides to 21 residues within the N-terminal region 259–289, plus the C-terminal residues 485–487 (Figure 4E). While the remaining 10 peaks could not be attributed to specific sequence positions, their sidechain chemical shifts in the TOCSY spectra were characteristic of five arginines and five alanines, which matched the numbers of remaining unassigned residues scattered within regions 258–289 and 482–487.
1H-15N correlation NMR spectra acquired on ICP4NΔIDR contained broad and dispersed amide signals characteristic for a large globular protein, whereas in the longer ICP4N construct, we observed additional prominent sharp, poorly dispersed amide signals characteristic of the presence of an IDR
These results suggest that an absolute requirement for tight specific binding is the presence of the intrinsically disordered N-terminal region, whereas if this region is deleted, the affinity for DNA consensus sequence is not only reduced, but approximately half of this consensus sequence is no longer recognized.
The combination of the ICP4N globular homo-dimer and IDRs tune the specificity and maximize affinity for a DNA motif. Conversely, the combination of the IDRs with the apparent conformational plasticity of the S-loop and R-turn likely allows non-consensus DNA interactions with ICP4. The flexibility of these regions may facilitate the linear movement of ICP4 along a DNA duplex in search of high affinity consensus sites, or hopping along longer distances mediated by the IDRs. 
No density was observed for either the C-terminal 33 residues of ICP47 or the two TMD0s, indicating these regions are flexible in this conformation.
In the five constructs, the IDRs with average diameter 0.5 ± 0.1–0.3 nm (mean ± s.d.) appeared constantly disordered.
This Flory exponent ν is close to 0.5, which holds for 2D and three-dimensional (3D) ideal and Gaussian chains, indicating that these constantly disordered segments have similar values of persistence length (Lp)
Incubation of PQBP-1 with ANS in the native condition (PBS) results in a blue shift of the fluorescence spectral peak from 510 nm to 475 nm accompanied by a threefold increase in quantum yield (Fig. 4 a). These effects are characteristic of ANS binding to a species adopting a premolten or molten-globule conformation. The relatively small increase in quantum yield suggested that ANS binding to PQBP-1 is not hydrophobic but instead is electrostatic in nature (43).
The RS of PQBP-1 obtained from gel filtration (3.50 nm) agrees well with that determined from sedimentation velocity experiments (3.67 nm), and that predicted for a natively disordered premolten globule protein (3.70 ± 0.41 nm).
The major peak has an elution volume that corresponds to two times the molecular mass of PQBP-1 (30.6 kDa), suggesting that the protein is dimeric if it adopts a compact, globular conformation. However, it is well established that elongated or unfolded proteins elute at a volume corresponding to a higher apparent molecular mass (40).
The RS of PQBP-1 obtained from gel filtration (3.50 nm) agrees well with that determined from sedimentation velocity experiments (3.67 nm), and that predicted for a natively disordered premolten globule protein (3.70 ± 0.41 nm).
The frictional coefficient ratio (f/f0) has a value of 1.74 (±0.09), which suggests that PQBP-1 is highly elongated. The Stokes radius of PQBP-1 calculated from these experiments is 3.67 (±0.02) nm.
The CD spectrum of PQBP-1 (Fig. 3 a) is typical of a protein or peptide without regular conformation: it lacks spectral features or any positive signals in the far-UV range, and has a characteristic negative maximum at 200 nm (41, 42). The absence of a positive CD signal below 200 nm indicates that there is very little or no helical structure.
From the top 20 solutions (data not shown), the spectrum is found to consist of a significant amount of β-strand structure (∼20–50%) and turns (∼15–40%), but little helical content (∼5–10%). The remaining regions of the protein (∼25–55%) are irregular structures. The variable temperature CD results are also typical of a disordered protein, with a broad melting profile (Fig. 3 b).
The processed scattering pattern of PQBP-1 (Fig. 5 a) yields an Rg of 3.8 (±0.2) nm, with a molecular mass of 30 (±3) kDa, suggesting that the protein remains monomeric in solution. The ratio of the Rg to the hydrodynamics radius (determined by AUC and SEC) is an indicator of the compactness of a protein. PQBP-1 has an Rg/RS ratio of 1.0, which is intermediate between the value of a spherical species (0.8) and that of an unstructured random coil (1.5) (47). 
Instead, this plot shows a peak at approximately q = 1 nm−1 followed by a shallow downward slope, suggesting that PQBP-1 is partially unfolded. The p(r) function of PQBP-1 has an asymmetric shape (Fig. 5 c), with its maximum at low r followed by a long tail. This is again consistent with an extended, perhaps partially unfolded molecule with the maximum dimension (Dmax) equal to 13 nm.
The N-terminal deletion mutants used were PQBP-1(179–265), PQBP-1(193–265) and PQBP-1(223–265). Fig. 2 shows that all of the deletion mutants bound to U5-15kD, and thus the residues 223 to 265 of PQBP-1 appear to be sufficient for the interaction with U5-15kD. The fragment PQBP-1(223–265) is called PQBP-1-CT43 in the following.
The attenuated resonances upon binding of PQBP-1-CT43 originate from residues in the α1 helix, the loop β2–β3, the strand β3, the loop β3–β4, and the strand β4 (Fig. 5A). These residues are located on one face of U5-15kD (Fig. 5B).
The HSQC spectrum of PQBP-1-CT43 in the free form is typical of an unstructured protein (Fig. 6A), since the backbone resonances are clustered together in a limited frequency range, spanning less than 0.7 ppm in the 1H dimension [23].
The binding of U5-15kD results in strong attenuation of the resonances originating from residues 241 to 263 of PQBP-1-CT43. From this, we conclude that the binding site is a continuous segment of residues 241–263 within the C-terminal domain, and that this segment undergoes some conformational and dynamical changes upon binding to U5-15kD.
On the other hand, there was no significant chemical shift change in residues 193–240 of PQBP-1 following the binding to U5-15kD [12]. This means that the residues 193–240, that is, the C-terminal domain except for the binding segment, remains unstructured even in the bound state.
The alanine substitutions markedly reduced the binding activity in the case of Y245A, V251A and L252A (Fig. 7). On the other hand, the N255A and R260A mutations slightly reduced the binding activity, although the effect of R260A was very small. 
Next, we compared the 1H–15N HSQC spectra of the segmentally isotope-labeled PQBP1 and the isolated C-fragment of residues 220–265. The 1H–15N HSQC spectrum of the C-fragment shows the backbone amide resonances within 8.0–8.6 ppm in the 1H dimension (Fig. 3c). The narrow chemical shift dispersion in the 1H dimension is characteristic of IDPs
The 1H–15N HSQC spectrum of the segmentally isotope-labeled PQBP1 is similar to that of the C-fragment, and thus the C-segment (residues 220–265) within full-length PQBP1 is disordered like the isolated C-fragment (Fig. 3).
We concluded that the C-segment (residues 220–265) interacts very weakly with the N-segment (residues 1–220) within the context of full-length PQBP1. This is compatible with the solution model of PQBP1 reported by Ree et al. [42].
The refined model of the PQBP1-CT43 in the complex consists of the residues 238–260: it lacks the 15 N-terminal residues (residues 223–237; KRNEAKTGADTTAAG) and the 5 C-terminal residues (residues 261–265; TKQQD) owing to conformational flexibility (Fig. 2a). PQBP1-CT43 in the complex adopts an L-shaped structure with an extended conformation (residues 238–247) followed by an α-helix conformation (residues 248–259). The α-helix starts at Pro248, which generates the bend of the L-shaped structure.
The crystal structure of the fusion protein was refined to a resolution of 2.5 Å with an Rwork/Rfree value of 19/24% (Table 1). The refined model of the fusion protein is missing the residues 223–243 and 260–265 of PQBP1, presumably owing to conformational flexibility.
The binary complex of PQBP1-CT43 and U5–15kD was obtained by mixing the proteins at a 1:5 molar ratio (U5–15kD to PQBP1-CT43). The crystals belong to space group P2 and contain four heterodimeric complexes in the asymmetric unit. The crystal structure of the binary complex was refined to a resolution of 2.1 Å with an Rwork/Rfree value of 19/25% (Table 1). The refined model of the PQBP1-CT43 in the complex consists of the residues 238–260: it lacks the 15 N-terminal residues (residues 223–237; KRNEAKTGADTTAAG) and the 5 C-terminal residues (residues 261–265; TKQQD) owing to conformational flexibility (Fig. 2a).
In the present study, we demonstrate that PQBP-1 is composed of a large unstructured region and a small folded core. Intriguingly, the large unstructured region encompasses two functional domains: a polar amino acid rich domain and a C-terminal domain. These findings suggest that PQBP-1 belongs to the family of intrinsically unstructured/disordered proteins.
We demonstrate that PQBP-1 is composed of a large unstructured region and a small folded core. The large unstructured region encompasses two functional domains, the PRD and the CTD.
To determine the secondary structure of the full-length PQBP-1, we recorded the far-UV CD spectrum (Fig. 3A). The CD spectrum displays a minimum at 204 nm with negative ellipticity of − 4700 deg cm2 dmol− 1, which is characteristic of a protein in largely unfolded conformations, whereas the spectral features indicative of α-helices or β-sheets are absent (Fig. 3A).

We demonstrate that PQBP-1 is composed of a large unstructured region and a small folded core. The large unstructured region encompasses two functional domains, the PRD and the CTD.
The 1H–15N HSQC spectrum also revealed the largely unfolded conformation of full-length PQBP-1, as judged by the numerous sharp resonances of backbone amides which overlap within a narrow 1H chemical shift range from 7.8 to 8.8 ppm (Fig. 4A). In addition to the sharp resonances, however, the HSQC spectrum for the full-length PQBP-1 showed several well-dispersed peaks typical of a folded conformation. The HSQC thus indicates that the full-length PQBP-1 contains a small structured region as well as a large unstructured region.
The 1H–15N HSQC spectra of PQBP-1-PR and PQBP-1-CT showed the sharp resonances of backbone amides clustered within 7.8–8.8 ppm (1H dimension), indicating highly flexible, unfolded conformations (Fig. 4C and D). In contrast, the backbone amide resonances of PQBP-1-WW are dispersed from 7.0 to 9.8 ppm, which is characteristic of folded proteins (Fig. 4B).
Therefore, the comparison of the HSQC spectra of full-length PQBP-1 and its fragments revealed that the PRD and CTD are largely unstructured in PQBP-1, and the WWD is involved in the structured region of PQBP-1.
Region corresponding to fragments PQBP-1-PR (94–176) and PQBP-1-CT (193–265).
The far-UV CD spectrum of PQBP-1-PR and -CT lacked the typical signature of secondary structure, exhibiting instead only a negative signal at 200 nm (Fig. 3C and D). 
These CD data support the conclusion derived from NMR that PQBP-1 comprises the folded region in the WWD and the large unstructured regions in the PRD and CTD.
Region corresponding to fragments PQBP-1-PR (94–176) and PQBP-1-CT (193–265).
Binding of U5-15kD is one of the functions of PQBP-1. To determine the affinity of PQBP-1 to U5-15kD, we decided to analyze this interaction by surface plasmon resonance (Fig. 6A). We determined the apparent association rate constant and dissociation rate constant for the complex between PQBP-1 and U5-15kD. PQBP-1 exhibited a fast association rate with U5-15kD (ka = 4.1 × 103 M− 1 s− 1) and a slow dissociation rate (kd = 2.5 × 10− 3 s− 1). Hence, the dissociation constant (KD = kd / ka) was calculated to be 0.6 μM.
The binding was confirmed by GST pull-down assay and gel-filtration chromatography. The GST pull-down assay shows that either GST-PQBP-1 or GST-PQBP-1-CT binds to U5-15kD (Fig. 6B).

The loops between residues 50-55, 87-98 and 259-267 are missing in the 2.5A structure as well as a part of the activation segment residues 176-182.  
The major differences occur in loop regions and include the loop before the αC helix, correspondingto a CycA contact region in the CDK2/CycA complex, the loop between β4 and β5 where CDK9 has an insertion compared with CDK2 (not defined by electron density (residues 87–98)),
In these structures, electron density for the C-terminal sequence of CDK9 is either missing after residue 325 (Baumli et al., 2008) or extends away from the CDK9 fold and adopts a structure that is determined by crystal contacts (Tahirov et al., 2010; Figure S4).
The electron density gradually weakens after residue 327, and further residues could not be built with confidence. This result indicates that the CDK9 C-terminal tail is inherently flexible.
(I) Apo CDK9 has a flexible C-terminal tail.
(V) ADP is released and the kinase returns to its apo state with a flexible C-terminal tail.
The CDK9 C-Terminal Tail Becomes Structured upon Binding to an Active Kinase Conformation.
The resulting crystal structure, solved at 3.6 Å resolution, shows unambiguous electron density for the inhibitor and 11 additional CDK9 C-terminal residues as compared with the structure of CDK9FL/cyclin T259 (Table 2; Figures 3B–3D).
CDK9 adopts a closed state upon DRB binding in which the N-terminal lobe is rotated by 8° with respect to the apo or ATP-bound structure.
This closed state is stabilized in the context of CDK9FL by folding of the C-terminal tail over the ATP binding site (Figures 3B and 3D).
 In addition to the catalityc activity, nuclear localization of Cdk9 protein requires the presence of the phospho-acceptor sites at the C-terminus tail.
To test this hypothesis, we constructed two C-terminal mutants Cdk9Δ337 and Cdk9ΔST both lacking the Ser/Thr residues previously shown to represent the major phospho-acceptor sites of auto-phosphorylation. As shown in Figure 1, unlike the Cdk9wt GFP-fusion protein, both GFP-Cdk9Δ337 and GFP-Cdk9ΔST fusions failed to accumulate to the nucleus and the majority of transfected cells showed a fluorescence signal in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. These results provide evidences that Cdk9 nuclear localization is dependent upon the catalytic activity of the kinase and the presence of the major phospho-acceptor residues required for auto-phosphorylation.
The PDB evidence shows this region lacks electron density, indicating it is disordered
The PDB evidence shows this region lacks electron density, indicating it is disordered.
At an ATP concentration of 100 μM, CDK9330 has only 30% of the kinase activity of the full-length protein (Figure S1A available online). Further enzymatic analysis revealed that this difference in activity does not result from differences in affinity toward GST-CTD, because both CDK9330 and CDK9FL have very similar KM,app (apparent KM value at a fixed concentration of the second substrate) values for this substrate (21.3 ± 3.7 μM versus 24.3 ± 2.7 μM, respectively; Figure S1B).
Furthermore, the dependence of KM as well as Vmax with respect to the ATP substrate indicates that the C-terminal tail influences ATP binding and catalysis (Cornish-Bowden, 2004).
Migfilin Residues 5-19 Mediate Binding to FLNa
The 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum of migfilin-(1-85) (supplemental Fig. S1) has chemical shifts typical of an unstructured species (30). Moreover, heteronuclear 1H-(15N)-NOE experiments showed complete peak inversion for nearly all the N-H cross-peaks, which implies that the protein chain is extremely flexible (31).
In particular, heteronuclear NOEs indicate that residues 50–78, which stabilize interlobe interactions in the Ca2+-bound state, are essentially disordered in the apo state
extramembrane NTD of SCaMC-1 undergoes a large structural change triggered by Ca2+ binding
Regions that have low heteronuclear NOE values include H3 and adjacent loops (residues 50–78), the Ca2+-binding loop of EF hand III (residues 99–109), as well as the C-terminal H9 (residues 159–170)
Ca2+-binding loop of EF hand III (residues 99–109)
the absence of Ca2+, NTD is partially unfolded in solution and binds specifically to TMD, whereas in the presence of Ca2+ it adopts a rigid and compact structure that largely abrogates TMD binding.
Topology scheme, with the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) represented by a dashed line.
Although the crystallized protein was intact (Supplementary Fig. S2a), both SUFU molecules in the orthorhombic asymmetric unit show no apparent density for the C-terminal domain residues 279–360, suggesting that this region of the molecule is highly mobile.
Collectively, these data suggest that residues 279–360 constitute an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) that is an inherent feature of native human SUFU.
These observations suggest that ceRED163−223 is unstructured in isolation and that its ceSmu1NTR-interacting α helices are induced upon complex formation

e found that PHC21–79 is disordered in solution as judged by poor peak dispersion on the 1H–15N HSQC spectra (Supplementary Fig. 3).
We found that the most significantly perturbed signals correspond to PHC2 residues 33–59 indicating that this represents the BMI1-binding motif in the PHC2 (Fig. 1f).
We assigned disordered fragments in BMI1106-240 by employing a combination of 13C-detected 2D CACO, CBCACO and CANCO experiments using a previously published protocol
Density for N-terminal residues 1–93 was not visible because these residues are most likely unstructured and disordered (nearly 30% are glycines).
The N-terminal 24 residues are disordered in the crystals.
The N-terminal 24 residues are disordered in the crystals correspond to the UniProt region 241-264.
The final refined model contains two complexes of Smad2 (residues 263–456) and SARA (residues 669–709), and 243 water molecules. The NH2- and COOH-terminal residues in Smad2 have no electron density, and we presume that these regions are disordered in the crystals.

Compared to the unphosphorylated Smad2 (Wu et al., 2000), the N-terminal extension adopts a different conformation and is more than 12 Å away, whereas the previously flexible C terminus becomes well ordered after phosphorylation (Figure 2B).
Structural comparison of the phosphorylated (green) and unphosphorylated (gold) Smad2-MH2 (PDB code 1DEV). The differences are apparent in two locations; the N-terminal extensions are more than 12 Å apart, and the flexible C terminus in the unphosphorylated Smad2 becomes rigid and ordered upon phosphorylation.
To reveal the structural basis of phosphorylation-induced homotrimerization, we crystallized a Smad2-MH2 fragment (residues 241–467) with Ser465 and Ser467 homogeneously phosphorylated.
The phosphorylated Smad2 forms a symmetric homotrimer, with both the phosphorylated C terminus and the N-terminal extension from one MH2 domain reaching out to interact with an adjacent domain (Figure 2C).
The flexibility of this loop was confirmed by low 1H,15N heteronuclear NOE values (Supplemental Fig. S3A) and by the presence of partially overlapped amides as indicated in the 1H-15N HSQC (Fig. 1D; Supplemental Fig. S1D).
The loop connecting the α1 and α2 helices (G-loop, Supplemental Fig. S1A), was excluded in the refined model because it is not well defined in the electron density map.
The SAXS data also supports the conformational variability sampled by the G-loop, in agreement with the faster motions detected by NMR, with heteronuclear NOE values below 0.3 (Fig. 3B; Supplemental Fig. S3B).
CD, NMR and fluorescence data confirm the in silico predictions and show that the N-terminus of Dre2 [Dre2 (1–133)] is a stably-folded domain, whereas the C-terminus is intrinsically unstructured, and contains eight cysteines that coordinate the Fe-S clusters.
A tight interaction between the Fe-S-containing Dre2-C-terminus and the two FMN-binding and FAD-binding domains from the reductase Tah18 is essential for yeast viability.
Fibronectin-binding proteins (FnBPs), anchored in the bacterial cell wall, have multiple Fn-binding repeats in an unfolded region of the protein
As well as showing how pathogenic bacteria can adhere to F1 modules in 1–5 F1 of Fn, the consequences of the mechanism, namely the high affinity and specificity of the binding, the significant conformational change undergone by the unfolded region of the FnBP and the presence of multiple Fn-binding sites, are all likely to have a role in bacterial invasion
Authors said "...a long unstructured region of 13 amino acids (residues 242–255), whereas α2 packs against β7 and β8." "It forms a flexible finger that protrudes into solution. Its intrinsic high flexibility is directly supported by the relaxation parameters, which, in this region, differ significantly from the average values".
In the complex, however, HBP1 SID forms an amphipathic helix (αA) that extends from Ala366 to Gln376. The
regions preceding and following the helix in the NMR structure are poorly defined, most likely owing to a lack of experimental restraints and/or enhanced flexibility.
The HBP1
SID interacts specifically with the Sin3 PAH2 domain, but bears little
similarity to the previously characterized Mad class of PAH2 binders,
suggesting a fundamentally different mode of interaction.
This region contains a known linear motif (ELM:LIG_PAM2_2)
To characterize the binding in solution, we carried out ITC and NMR experiments with the DUF region of GW182 and PABPC1 Mlle (Fig. 2). 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra of the DUF region showed limited dispersion of signals, which confirms that the peptide is unfolded prior to Mlle binding
The 1H-NMR spectra of ARTS CTD showed a narrow dispersion of amide resonances. This pattern implies a random coil conformation and is characteristic of disordered regions and peptides.
We showed that the nine C-terminal residues (266-274) of the proapoptotic ARTS protein mediate its interaction with the Bir3 domain of XIAP.
The far-UV CD spectrum of ARTS C-terminal domain (CTD) is composed largely of a minimum at 200 nm and is missing the typical signatures of secondary structures, indicating mainly a random coil. This is a characteristic pattern for disordered regions.
We showed that the nine C-terminal residues (266-274) of the proapoptotic ARTS protein mediate its interaction with the Bir3 domain of XIAP.
The four N-terminal residues, 16 C-terminal residues, and four loop regions corresponding to residues 190 –216, 288 –290, 343–346, and 356 –361 lacked defined electron density and were omitted from the model (Fig. 1).
ATG4B contains a C-terminal LIR motif important for binding and efficient cleavage of mammalian orthologs of yeast Atg8.
ATG4B contains a C-terminal LIR motif important for a strong interaction with Atg8-family orthologs
C-terminal sequences of ATG4B constructs carrying mutations affecting the C-terminal LIR motif.
Next, a series of mutant ATG4B constructs, either deleted for the C-terminal LIR region (ΔLIRC) or carrying 2 (2mLIR) or 5 (5mLIR) point mutations affecting the motif (Fig. 1D), were in vitro translated and tested for interaction with Atg8-family orthologs fused to GST. Mutation of 2 residues in the core LIRC motif (F388A and L391A) reduced the interaction of ATG4B with LC3A, LC3B, LC3C and GABARAPL2 to 25% residual binding, and the interactions with GABARAP or GABARAPL1 to 60% (Fig. 1E and F). However, mutation of 5 residues in the LIRC region, or deletion of the LIRC motif, reduced the interactions with GABARAP and GABARAPL1 to 10% to 15% (Fig. 1E and F). The 5 point-mutations included the 3 negatively charged residues located immediately N-terminal to the core LIRC motif (Fig. 1D), in addition to the F388A and L391A mutations. In contrast to mutation of the C-terminal LIR, mutation or deletion of the N-terminal YDTL LIR (LIRN) had only a very minor effect on the interaction with LC3B or GABARAPL1 (Fig. 1G and H). Thus, we identified a LIR motif in the C terminus of ATG4B that contributed strongly to the interaction between ATG4B and Atg8-family proteins.
The C-terminal LIR motif corresponds to residues 388-391 (FEIL).
The structure from residues 191 to 215, which links the auxiliary domain and protease domain, could not be constructed because of the weak electron density.
Disordered region in ATG4B.
The four N-terminal residues, 16 C-terminal residues, and four loop regions corresponding to residues 190 –216, 288 –290, 343–346, and 356 –361 lacked defined electron density and were omitted from the model (Fig. 1).
ATG4B contains a C-terminal LIR motif important for binding and efficient cleavage of mammalian orthologs of yeast Atg8. 
ATG4B contains a C-terminal LIR motif important for a strong interaction with Atg8-family orthologs
The C-terminal LIR motif is important for the interaction of full-length ATG4B with Atg8-family orthologs. Myc-tagged ATG4B constructs were in vitro translated in the presence of [35S]methionine, and tested in GST affinity isolation experiments for binding to the indicated Atg8-family orthologs fused to GST. Bound proteins were detected by autoradiography (AR), and immobilized GST or GST-tagged proteins by Coomassie brilliant blue staining (CBB).

Strikingly, the LIR motif of ATG4B was required for stabilization of the unlipidated forms of GABARAP and GABARAPL1 in cells.
The LIRC motif of ATG4B is required for stabilization of GABARAP and GABARAPL1. (A) The endogenous level of GABARAP is severely diminished in cells that do not express ATG4B. Extracts of atg4b KO cells reconstituted with the indicated GFP-ATG4 constructs were analyzed by western blotting.
Intriguingly, we observed that GABARAP and GABARAPL1 were degraded and virtually absent in cells lacking ATG4B. Consistently, the levels of these 2 proteins were highly elevated in cells overexpressing WT ATG4B. We propose that binding to ATG4B stabilizes these proteins. Without this stabilization they are rapidly degraded by the proteasome and unavailable for autophagosome formation.

We solved the crystal structures of the GABARAPL1-ATG4B C-terminal LIR complex.
Crystal structures of the complex of GABARAPL1 with 2 LIR peptides at 1.55- and 1.75-Å resolution reveal canonical LIR-LDS interactions with important contributions from electrostatic interactions involving residues both N-terminal to, and within, the core LIR.
To evaluate the interaction between the C-terminal LIR-motif of ATG4B with Atg8-family proteins in more detail, we determined the X-ray structure of GABARAPL1 in complex with a peptide containing the C-terminal 10-amino acid LIRC motif of ATG4B (Fig. S1A).
The structure displays 4 additional interactions: 1) Electrostatic interactions between the acidic N-terminal LIRC residues 384Glu-Asp-Glu-Asp387 of ATG4B and the basic residues GABARAPL1 (K46), GABARAPL1 (K24), GABARAPL1 (K20) and GABARAPL1 (K48), respectively; 2) a salt bridge between ATG4B (E389) and GABARAPL1 (R67); 3) some hydrophobic interactions between ATG4B (I390) in position +2 and GABARAPL1 (L50) as well as GABARAPL1 (Y25); 4) 3 hydrogen bonds between the carbonyls of ATG4B (L391), ATG4B (S392) and the guanidinium group of GABARAPL1 (R28). Except for the C-terminal ATG4B (L393), all residues in the LIRC are contributing to the interaction.
The C-terminal LIR motif corresponds to residues 388-391 (FEIL).
The structure from residues 191 to 215, which links the auxiliary domain and protease domain, could not be constructed because of the weak electron density.
GPIHBP1 is highly asymmetrical with an N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) rich in acidic residues
Authors show the region is intrinsically unstructured by its large negative ellipticity at 200 nm and moderate ellipticity at 190 nm, typical of IDR.
The 43 amino acids (94–136) linking the B-box to the ETS domain of SAP-1 are unobserved in the electron density map and are therefore likely to be highly disordered.
This linker region must be flexible as it accommodates cooperative binding of SAP-1 and SRF on sites disposed with virtually any spacing of up to 10 bp as well as direction reversal of the EBS with respect to the CArG-box
The terminal amino acids and the SAP-1 linker region disordered in the structure are printed in gray.

Small-angle X-ray scattering studies. A, SAXS intensities of galectin-3 as a function of the scattering vector q (Å−1). B, the Kratky plot is typical of that of a partially folded protein.
Resonances from the CRD are relatively well dispersed for the canonical β-sheet structure as previously reported for truncated Gal-3 CRD (Umemoto and Leffler 2001), whereas those arising from the N-terminal tail exhibit rather narrow line widths, reflecting comparatively increased internal mobility. In addition, resonances arising from the N-terminal tail are minimally dispersed and fall within the spectral region associated with random coil conformation.
The low sequence complexity of the structurally disordered NTD is reminiscent of those recently reported proteins whose low-complexity domains mediate their liquid–liquid phase separation behavior in various cellular functions. Indeed, we found that the NTD (as does a phosphomimetic mutant S6E) undergoes temperature-dependent phase separation.
The text is in the discussion, but the figure showing LLPS is in the supplementary.
The MTSL label on the CRD (I250C; the β-strand 11) bleaches a broad range of intensity in the NTD, consistent with the model that the NTD contacts with the CRD fuzzily and that the first ∼20 residues have less contact with this domain
The authors report an intra-protein interaction between the disordered N-terminal domain and the folded C-terminal domain.
The present study is focused on human galectin-3 (Gal-3) interactions with a 60 kDa rhamnogalacturonan RG-I-4 that we use as a model to garner information as to how galectins interact with large polysaccharides, as well as to develop this agent as a therapeutic against human disease. Gal-3 is unique among galectins, because as the only chimera-type, it has a long N-terminal tail (NT) that has long puzzled investigators due to its dynamic, disordered nature and presence of numerous prolines. Here, we use 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence NMR spectroscopy to demonstrate that multiple sites on RG-I-4 provide epitopes for binding to three sites on 15N-labeled Gal-3, two within its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and one at a novel site within the NT encompassing the first 40 residues that are highly conserved among all species of Gal-3.
A number of NT resonances are chemically shifted by the presence of RG-I-4, with the most perturbed ones belonging to residues within the N-terminal part of the NT as observed with the NT in full length Gal-3. These data indicate that the Gal-3 NT (independent of the presence of the CRD) binds to one or more sites within the RG-I-4 polysaccharide.
Although there are some changes that occur within the C-terminal part of the NT (residues ~75–100), the most perturbed resonances belong to residues within the N-terminal part of the NT (residues 1–40). Likewise, seven of the nine Asn/Gln residues in the NT (i.e., N4, N16, N18, Q20, N28, Q29, Q48) perturbed by interactions with RG-I-4.
Indeed, a 1 mM NTD sample with 150 mM NaCl condenses at higher temperatures and dissolves at lower ones in a reversible manner.
We collected the longitudinal relaxation rates (R1), transverse relaxation rates (R2), and heteronuclear NOEs (hetNOEs) at different protein concentrations. The residues in the NTD have higher R1 values, lower R2 values, and lower hetNOEs than those in the CRD because the intrinsically disordered region is more dynamic.
The PDB shows that this region lacks electron density, indicating that it is disordered.
V3, which is encompassed by the 26-amino-acid disordered region, was not visible
in the structure.
V3 could not be modeled in the electron-density map. The V3 loop is
part of a larger motif that we have termed the GHL (glycopeptide
helix loop) and is believed to interact extensively with the glycopeptide.
All residues of LRP6(3-4) are visible in both copies in the crystal, except for the loop comprising residues 1006–1012. In both copies, at least one sugar is visible at each of the five predicted N-linked glycosylation sites (Figure S1). The model of Dkk1_C comprises residues 182–264, except that the loop spanning residues 250–258 is disordered.
Amide proton chemical shift values consistent with unstructured protein and a lack of medium and long range NOEs indicated that residues 42–80 were unstructured.
A partial trypsin digestion reaction of full-length gpFI by SDS-PAGE revealed the presence of a single band of ∼10 kDa that was resolved as two protein fragments by native PAGE. This further supports the presence of two independently folded domains in this protein with cleavage likely taking place at the single Arg residue present at position 56 in the unstructured loop between the two domains.

The most outstanding structural feature of the BamCD complex is the 73-residue-long unstructured N terminus of BamC that has not been observed in previously reported structures (11, 23, 39); it folds into an elongated U-shaped loop structure that interacts extensively with BamD by fitting into a trail of crevices that run along the longitudinal axis of BamD (Fig. 2b and supplemental Fig. 3).
 In this study, we crystallized BamD in a heterodimeric complex with BamCUN, and its structure was solved and refined to 2.9 Å resolution (supplemental Table 2).
The first 100 N-terminal residues are not structured in BamC
Heteronuclear 15N{1H} NOEs were measured for the backbone amides in BamC101-344 and as seen in Fig. 2a, residues in the N- and C-terminal domains generally had NOE values above 0.7, whereas residues 214 to 227 in the linker had significantly lower 15N{1H} NOE values (0.13 to 0.42), indicating a flexible linker.

Size exclusion chromatography analysis showed that any truncated form of BamC missing the unstructured N terminus (i.e. BamCN, BamCC, and BamCNC) was unable to form the BamCD complex (Fig. 1b and supplemental Fig. 1). On the other hand, BamCUN co-purified with BamD throughout the entire purification process despite missing the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1, c and d).
Together, these results show that the unstructured N terminus of BamC is required for the formation of the BamCD complex.
The most outstanding structural feature of the BamCD complex is the 73-residue-long unstructured N terminus of BamC that has not been observed in previously reported structures (11, 23, 39); it folds into an elongated U-shaped loop structure that interacts extensively with BamD by fitting into a trail of crevices that run along the longitudinal axis of BamD (Fig. 2b and supplemental Fig. 3).

It was likely that the R-factor and R-free values were rather high owing to the highest disordered rate. The npMAP2K6 is composed of 340 residues, with 49 residues disordered in the crystal. Although the N-terminal
region (residues 1-43) and the His 6 -tag were disordered, the kinase domain (residues 44-334) was ordered (Fig. 2A).
These 15N-detected experiments were used to assign the backbone resonances of human transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATC2) (residues 131–294). This portion of NFAT is disordered.
Our data demonstrate that, upon PKA phosphorylation, 14-3-3 binds to NFAT and blocks access to the nuclear localization sequence (NLS), which may prevent the nuclear transport protein importin from translocating NFAT to the nucleus, thus preventing transcriptional activation
PKA phosphorylation resulted in downfield shifts of the 1H resonances of two serine residues that are assigned to S-225 and S-255.
PKA phosphorylation of NFAT promotes its association with the 14-3-3 chaperone protein, which results in the inhibition of NFAT transcriptional activity (26).
The shape of the spectra of Nt_NLS and NLS_PHD can be explained by the combination of the spectra of Nt
or PHD, respectively, and the spectrum of a random-coil chain: less negative ellipticity at 222 nm, less positive ellipticity at 190 nm, and a shift to lower wavelengths of the Nt minimum at 208 nm and the PHD minimum at 202 nm. These results suggest that NLS behaves as a disordered random coil.
Although purified spinach PsbP protein shows no degradation products by analytical SDS gel electrophoresis and full-length protein is recovered from dissolved crystals as reported already [35], the electron density is not resolved in the N-terminal region (residues 1–15) and in two internal regions (residues 90–107 and 135–139), as in the structure of tobacco PsbP (PDB ID 1V2B [33]; Figure 1).
Unresolved residues (90-107) correspond to residues 171-188 in Uniprot
 Except for the N-terminal 11 residues, we constructed the structure of spinach PsbP in its entirety for the first time (P12 to A186) (Figure 1A).
Our structures add crucial structural information for PsbP, with two Mn ions identified inside PsbP for the first time. We propose that one of the ions is responsible for a dramatic conformational change (with a maximum move of 20 Å) that is revealed here within the long region (aa 90–107).
We propose that the observed conformational change in the loop90–107 region is induced by binding of Mn2.

MycF WT crystal contents Mg-disordered lid. The active site of MycF becomes progressively more ordered as the cosubstrate and substrate bind. SAM/SAH binding to MycF closes the helical lid domain over the cosubstrate, partially orders the lid loop, and forms the binding site for the substrate mycinamicin III, which orders the remainder of the lid loop.

A strong correlation exists between the most dynamic histone residues identified in the current study, amino acids 1–35 in H3 and 1–21 in H4, and the crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle which reveals the same residues as being largely unstructured.

The N(0)-binding region of the vesicular stomatitis virus phosphoprotein is globally disordered but contains transient α-helices.
Here, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we show that an isolated peptide corresponding to the 60 first N-terminal residues of VSV P (P(60)) and encompassing P(NTR) has overall molecular dimensions and a dynamic behavior characteristic of a disordered protein but transiently populates conformers containing α-helices.
Isolated VSV P60 is intrinsically disordered but exhibits transient secondary structures
The 2D 1H-15N-HSQC NMR spectrum of P60 exhibited narrow line widths and poor dispersion of the amide proton chemical shifts (Fig. 3), in agreement with structural disorder in solution. These results indicate that VSV P60 has overall molecular dimensions and NMR spectroscopic properties of a disordered protein, as shown previously for RV P68.

The far-UV CD spectrum exhibited a prominent shoulder near 222 nm and a minimum near 205 nm, suggesting the presence of α-helical structure (Fig. 4). Assuming that the molar ellipticity value at 222 nm reports only on the presence of α-helix, the average helical content of P60 was estimated to be 7%.12,42 NMR spectroscopy is highly sensitive to local structure and therefore provides information about the location and population of fluctuating secondary structures within an otherwise flexible protein.

The N-terminal domain of VSV P (P60, aa 1–60) was produced in Escherichia coli as a recombinant protein containing a C-terminal His-tag (8 aa). The long-term stability of P60 was significantly improved in the presence of a mixture of 50 mMl-Arg and 50 mMl-Glu.39 Under these conditions, an average molecular mass of 7.2 ± 0.7 kDa was determined by SEC combined with detection by multiangle laser light scattering and refractometry (SEC/MALLS/RI), indicating that P60 was monomeric (MM calculated from the sequence = 8054 Da) and well behaved in solution up to concentrations of 2 mM (Fig. 1). Its Stokes' radius of 2.3 ± 0.1 nm indicated an extended conformation, closer to that expected for an unfolded protein of the same molecular mass (RS = 2.5 nm) than to that expected for a globular protein (RS = 1.5 nm).
Replication of non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses requires the continuous supply of the nucleoprotein (N) in the form of a complex with the phosphoprotein (P). Here, we present the structural characterization of a soluble, heterodimeric complex between a variant of vesicular stomatitis virus N lacking its 21 N-terminal residues (NΔ21) and a peptide of 60 amino acids (P60) encompassing the molecular recognition element (MoRE) of P that binds RNA-free N (N0). The complex crystallized in a decameric circular form, which was solved at 3.0 Å resolution, reveals how the MoRE folds upon binding to N and competes with RNA binding and N polymerization.

The characterization by absorbance spectroscopy and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) combined with static light scattering (MALLS) demonstrates that both NΔ210-P60 and NΔ210-P dimer complexes are free of RNA in solution, forming soluble heterodimers or heterotrimers, respectively. Therefore, P60 fulfills both chaperone activities of full-length P.

The 12 residue linker connecting the modules, though slightly structured through an interaction with LA4, is highly flexible.
Across species, evolution has conserved the length (12–14 residues) of the linker between LA4 and LA5 without conservation of any specific residues, which is typically seen for flexible linkers.
Truncation of this linker significantly alters the interaction with LDL particles hinting that it may be required for the two modules to access distant epitopes on ligands such as multiple copies of ApoE on a lipoprotein surface.
No interpretable electron density was observed for the EGF(B) domain, suggesting that it is disordered in the crystals

Only small parts of the structure are disordered. HypK: residues 1–25, 43–56
Our study also shows that the regulatory function of HypK resides in its N-terminal region comprising the first 50 residues (disordered N terminus and helix α1), which bind at the entrance of the Naa10 active site and seem to block access to the active site.
Small parts of the structure are disordered: the lysine-rich region (charged helix) 573–637.

The HSQC intensity profile of MKK4 12−86 in the presence of p38α reveals that the interaction is not only localized to the docking site motif, but implicates the KIS domain of MKK4

Line broadening is observed for multiple residues upon addition of JNK1 demonstrating a clear interaction, while chemical shift changes are negligible (Figure 1). We quantified the intensities of the resonances as a function of the molar ratio of JNK1 showing that the interacting region extends over a large part of the MKK4 sequence with the docking site motif (40KRKALKLNF48) experiencing the most pronounced line broadening (Figure 2).
We compared the thermodynamic profiles of the MKK4:JNK1 and MKK4:p38α complexes by using ITC (Figure 4). Both complexes show a 1:1 stoichiometry with the JNK1 complex displaying an approximately three times higher binding affinity (KD = 1.3 μM) than the p38α complex (KD = 4.1 μM).
This entry corresponds to the experimental evidences of two independent heterodimers MKK4:JNK1 and MKK4:p38α. Binding free energies reveal that JNK1 and p38α binding to MKK4 are governed by different thermodynamic contributions. p38α ruled by a clear entropic contribution, while the enthalpy compensates the lack of entropic contribution for the JNK1 interaction.
The results show that MKK4 folds into two different conformations upon binding to JNK1 and p38α. While MKK4 shows poor helical propensity in complex with p38α, it folds into a helix encompassing residues K40-K45 upon binding to JNK1 (Figure 6a). We note that a conformational selection mechanism can be ruled out in the case of the JNK1 complex, as MKK4 does not show any helical propensity in its free state (Figure 6a) [35]. 
Despite prominent helix is comprised between residues 40 and 45, the region between residue 28 and 49 shows significant population of α-helix as calculated from the experimental chemical shifts.
he results show that MKK4 folds into two different conformations upon binding to JNK1 and p38α.

We note that a conformational selection mechanism can be ruled out in the case of the JNK1 complex, as MKK4 does not show any helical propensity in its free state (Figure 6a) [35]. 
The fact that MKK4 folds into two different conformations upon binding to the two paralogous MAPKs explains the observed thermodynamic profiles of the two complexes derived from ITC experiments (Figure 4c,d).
The authors correlate MKK4 conformational differences to the structural properties of its binders by a compilation of JNK1 and p38α binding to other MAPKs. While p38α mostly accommodates fully extended peptides, JNK1 is reported to bind short helical motifs. These findings remark the plasticity of the disordered region of MKK4 to interact with different substrates. 
For both the RNA-free and RNA-bound Lsm complexes, the following regions have no clear electron density and are absent in the final atomic models: residues 90–95 of Lsm2, residues 80–89 of Lsm3, residues 87–93 of Lsm4, residues 1–5 and 85–93 of Lsm5, residues 1–10 of Lsm6, residues 1–26 and 106–115 of Lsm7, residues 68–109 of Lsm8. These sequences are all located on the surface and presumably highly flexible.

The final model for the FHF2A structure contains residues 64 –212 of two
FHF2A molecules; residues 60 – 63 at the N terminus and 213–237 at
the C terminus are disordered in each of the two molecules.
We calculated secondary structure propensities (SSPs) based on experimental Cα and Cβ chemical shifts, which indicate that no strong propensities for either α-helical or extended structure exist (Fig. 2a).
 The obtained conformational ensembles describe B/NPTAIL as a protein behaving much like a statistical coil, with the exception of a region starting around residue 59 that had a slightly increased propensity to form right handed α-helices as compared to random coil. 
Interestingly, the interaction between B/NPTAIL and importin-α involves all residues of the disordered tail between amino acids 30 and 71 (Fig. 4c).
The experimental SAXS curve of full length B/NP was in reasonable agreement (chi2 below 1) with this conformational ensemble (Fig. 2d).
An absence of linearity in the Guinier plot reflects the presence of aggregates and/or attractive/repulsive interactions between the scattering particles.
The complex between importin-α7 and B/NP was studied with SAXS. The analysis shows the volumes of the two proteins. Although the SAXS envelope of a disordered chain cannot give a single structure for B/NTAIL the complex shows that importin-α binds two thirds of the tail, concordant with the results from NMR, and no other parts of B/NP.
The peak eluted at 12.5 mL corresponds to the B/NPTAIL and the SDS-PAGE gel confirms the presence of the protein contained in that elution peak (band at 15 kDa). The elution peak at 10.5 mL corresponds to importin-α7 alone and the peak at 10.1 mL corresponds to the complex between B/NPTAIL and importin-α7. These results confirm that importin-α7 binds the full-length influenza B nucleoprotein and its N-terminal tail but not B/NPCORE.
B/NPTAIL binds human importin-α7 with a K d of 844 nM, similar to the affinity measured between A/NP and the mouse importin-α1 (K d between 2 and 5 µM)19,20.

The N-terminal 2 residues and the C-terminal 14 residues in EGL-1 have no electron density in the maps, and we presume that these regions are disordered in the crystals.

We present to our knowledge the first structural characterization of the proliferating-cell-nuclear-antigen-associated factor p15(PAF), showing that it is monomeric and intrinsically disordered in solution but has nonrandom conformational preferences at sites of protein-protein interactions.
The lack of dispersion in the backbone amide 1H chemical shifts as seen in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum gives evidence of the largely disordered and flexible nature of p15PAF under native conditions.
1H-15N RDCs of p15PAF measured in a stretched polyacrylamide gel aligning medium are mainly negative (Fig. 4, black circles), as observed in disordered proteins (16,47).
We present to our knowledge the first structural characterization of the proliferating-cell-nuclear-antigen-associated factor p15(PAF), showing that it is monomeric and intrinsically disordered in solution but has nonrandom conformational preferences at sites of protein-protein interactions.
The far-UV CD spectrum of p15PAF shows a minimum at 198 nm and a shoulder at 222 nm, consistent with a predominantly random-coil protein with little secondary structure (Fig. 2 B). The thermal denaturation curve of p15PAF followed by the changes in the CD signal at 222 nm (see Fig. 2 B, inset) does not show any cooperative folding-unfolding transition, indicating that p15PAF lacks a defined tertiary structure.

We used SAXS to characterize the conformational space sampled by p15PAF in solution and to validate the structure ensemble derived from the RDC data. As shown in Fig. 5, the SAXS profile of p15PAF and its Kratky representation are typical for a disordered protein. The SAXS curve shows no features (Fig. 5 A) and the Kratky plot does not show a maximum, with a monotonic increase at large momentum transfer values (Fig. 5 B).

The protein eluted from the SEC column at a volume that, according to the calibration with molecular weight standards, corresponds to an apparent molar mass of 25 kDa. However, the mass derived from the MALLS data is 11.5 kDa (Fig. 2 A), demonstrating that p15PAF is monomeric. These inconsistent results suggest that p15PAF is either folded with an elongated shape or is flexible and disordered (39). In both instances, it would elute at a smaller volume than a globular protein of the same mass.
As a disordered protein, p15 yields NMR spectra with sharp signals and poor dispersion in the proton frequency. On addition of excess PCNA, signal intensities decrease generally and most notably for the central residues V53-D75 that even disappear (Fig. 1d). This observation highlights the central region of p15 as the principal binding site for PCNA, which includes the PIP-box motif (62QKGIGEFF69, conserved residues underlined).
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements could be fitted very well to a model assuming independent p15 binding to equivalent sites in the PCNA trimer, with a dissociation constant of 1.1 μM at 25 °C (Fig. 1c).
All three p15 fragments bind PCNA, but with decreasing affinity (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). The N-terminal deletion mutant binds PCNA with only slightly lower affinity than p15, implying that any transient interactions of the N-terminal V2-S31 residues stabilize the complex only marginally. The affinity of p1550–77, however, is reduced by a factor of 5 and the shortest core fragment p1559–70 even by a factor of 33. These results indicate that residues G50-T58 and/or L71-E77 strongly contribute to PCNA binding, which is further enhanced by residues A32-G49.
Isothermal titration calorimetry measurements and analysis of p15 and fragments binding to PCNA in PBS, pH 7.0 at 35 °C.
Residues N51-L71 of p1550–77 are well defined in the crystal structure (Supplementary Fig. 6), although the side chains of N51, R70 and L71 could not be reliably modelled (Fig. 2b).
The p15–DNA interaction is unspecific since any of the DNA molecules tested (single-stranded DNA, primed DNA and flapped DNA) are bound by p15 with similar affinity (Supplementary Fig. 11a). The binding isotherms could be fitted to a 1:1 interaction model, with apparent dissociation constants between 0.2 and 0.4 μM at 25 °C.
The affinity of p15ΔN is reduced by two orders of magnitude, indicating that the basic N-terminal region of p15 contributes most to the DNA affinity (Fig. 5a).

The central fragment p1550–77 binds DNA with even lower affinity, and no DNA binding was observed with the core PIP-box fragment p1559–70. When DNA was titrated with PCNA-bound p15, the increase in fluorescence polarization was larger (Fig. 5a), indicating that a ternary complex forms (since the larger the size of the complex the larger the polarization). The slightly reduced DNA affinity shows that PCNA interferes only weakly with p15 binding to DNA. Similarly, when DNA-bound p15 was titrated with PCNA (Fig. 5b) the PCNA affinity was comparable to that of isolated p15 (or p1550–77). Thus, a ternary p15–PCNA–DNA complex forms in solution in which the direct p15–PCNA and p15–DNA interactions are largely independent of each other.

The poor HN signal dispersion and only minor changes in Cα chemical shifts (Supplementary Fig. 13) indicate that p15 does not acquire a defined structure on binding to the DNA; rather, its backbone remains flexible and disordered. In the presence of PCNA, DNA-bound p15 shows a similar pattern of NMR signal attenuation as in the absence of DNA (Fig. 5c), in line with a ternary complex where the central region of p15 is tightly bound to PCNA.
For an experimental verification of this possibility, PCNA in the presence of p15, DNA or both was stained with uranyl acetate and observed by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 6b). Two-dimensional analysis of single particle projections yielded class averages for top-, side-, and tilted-views of the PCNA ring, with a larger proportion of tilted-view classes for the ternary p15–DNA–PCNA complex (Supplementary Fig. 15). Most remarkably, many of the top- and tilted-views of the ternary complex show increased density within the PCNA ring compared to both binary mixtures (where only the p15–PCNA mixture, however, is expected to form a complex). The same result is obtained when the rotational power spectra of individual particles in the three data sets are calculated and classified (Supplementary Fig. 16). These observations indicate that p15-bound DNA in the ternary complex is (at least transiently) located within the PCNA ring.
Disordered loop in the RbN domain
The spacer, which is the least conserved region of Rb (Fig. 1a), and is different in the related p107 and p130 pocket proteins, appears to be unstructured or loosely folded based on proteolytic digestion (data not shown).
This is the spacer joining the A and B subdomains of RbAB (RbPL)
This is a Flexible region in the RbA subdomain that appears disordered in most RbAB structures
The work provides evidence that phosphorylation of RbIDL produces a transition from unassociated to self-associated Rb: "This analysis suggests an equilibrium between associated and dissociated RbN and pocket domains, in which phos- phorylation of RbIDL shifts the equilibrium toward the associated conformation. "
This region corresponds to the linker joining the RbN and RbAB domains. T373 phosphorylation induces conformational transitions in the linker region. The larger interface (2277 A ̊ 2 buried surface area) is formed between pocket subdomain A and RbN subdomain B and is mediated by T373 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B)
This is the RbIDL linker region joining the RbN and the RbAB domains (the two main structured domains in Rb).
373 phosphorylation induces interactions of RbIDL with the RbAB domain that also block E2F binding, favouring the autoinhibited conformation. ""
Here we observe that T356 phosphorylation disorders a helix in RbN.

This is a Flexible region in the RbA subdomain that appears disordered in most RbAB structures
Region is part of the RbPL, a flexible loop connecting the A and B subdomains of the central RbAB domain. This loop can be phosphorylated, inducing a closed conformation that has decreased ability to bind the E2F transcription factor
Phosphorylation of S608 in the flexible RbPL loop induces binding to RbAB (residues 600-609) favouring a "closed" autoinhibited conformation which inhibits binding of the E2F transactivation domain to pRb. "In sum, the RbPL–P structure demonstrates that S608 phosphorylation results in a bound and inhibitory conformation of RbPL that directly blocks the E2FTD-binding site."
This region of the RbPL linker appears disordered in the crystal structure
Limited proteolysis of an Rb protein containing the pocket and RbC domains (771-928) suggested that RbC does not contain stable structural domains. However, the region 771-785 is part of the ordered Rb pocket domain and hence not included in the annotation.
NMR data indicate that the isolated RbC (786-928) is unstructured in solution.
Here, we demonstrate an interaction between RbC and the CC-MB domains of E2F-DP heterodimers and present the crystal structure of an RbC-E2F1-DP1 complex.

RbC Binds to E2FCM-DPCM through a Bipartite Interaction
The lack of 15N and particularly 1H chemical shift dispersion in (A) and (B) are consistent with polypeptides lacking significant structure (Dyson and Wright, 2004). The fact that the NMR data suggests that E2F1CM is unstructured in the absence of DP1CM is consistent with the structural and biochemical studies presented in this study, which indicate that the stability of E2F1CM requires heterodimerization. 
In addition, NMR data suggest that E2F1CM is unstructured in the absence of DP1 (Supplemental Data, Section 2). These results confirm the structure-based prediction that the E2F1CM homodimer is less stable than the E2F1CM-DP1CM heterodimer, and they provide an explanation for the observation that the DNA binding and transactivation activities of E2F1 are reduced in the absence of a DP partner
Intermolecular interactions are distributed throughout the E2F1 and DP1 polypeptides and involve the coiled coil, the β sandwich, and essentially all of the additional secondary-structure elements (Figures 2A and 2B).

15N HSQC NMR spectra indicate that Elc1 has regions of dynamic instability and/or flexibility. Most peaks missing from the HSQC spectrum and those lacking correlations in triple-resonance and NOESY spectra are from residues at the C terminus of Elc1. Thus, the dynamic instability of Elc1 appears to be most prominent at the C terminus.
Like unfolded polypeptides, the CD spectrum of LjIDP1 shows a large negative peak at ∼200 nm
LjIDP1 protease sensitivity is comparable with the intrinsically disordered α-synuclein, whereas the globular protein lysozyme remains intact under the same conditions. This suggests that the amino acid backbone of LjIDP1 is largely accessible to proteolytic attack and in combination with the spectroscopic data unequivocally shows that LjIDP1 is largely disordered along the entire length.
The 1H spectrum of LjIDP1 shows no signal dispersion typical of globular proteins, and the similarity of the spectra in the aliphatic region with and without urea indicates that no major structural transitions occurred and supports the notion that LjIDP1 is intrinsically disordered.
Ca2+ depletion from csPA makes it susceptible to the limited proteolysis by bovine α-chymotrypsin at 37 °C.
Apo-PA is destabilized due to the highly unfavorable electrostatic repulsion of the nearby carboxylates within Ca2+-binding loops of PA, which turns into favorable electrostatic attraction upon the metal association.
The DSC data strongly evidence the absence of rigid tertiary structure in apo-csPA. This conclusion is further supported by the data on GdmCl-induced unfolding of apo-csPA at 20 °C, monitored by its molar ellipticity at 222 nm.
Maximum intensity of bis-ANS fluorescence in the presence of apo-csPA exceeds that value for the Ca2+-loaded protein by a factor of 8, while bis-ANS emission spectrum maximum position (λmax) for apo-csPA is blue shifted by 2 nm with respect to the λmax value for the Ca2+-bound protein.
In summary, the
unphosphorylated state CTD2' is highly disordered, temporally
dynamic and contains nearly all trans-proline.
Two-dimensional NOESY proton spectrum shows that the intracellular regions of syndecan-4 exhibit extensive flexibility.
1) Thus, the lack of signal dispersion is strongly indicative of a polypeptide chain with little or no defined tertiary structure

PAGE4 preferential binding sites when the PAGE4-FLAG protein was present (lane 3) as well as FLAG-p53, which was used as a positive control. DNA sequence analysis revealed that PAGE4 preferentially binds to a GC-rich sequence, 5'-GCCGCGGGG-3' (Fig. 4)
1) These spectra showed that the PAGE4 polypeptide chain contains no significant alpha-helical or beta-strand secondary structural elements over this temperature range as evidenced by low ellipticity values in the 215–230 nm region

PAGE4 preferential binding sites when the PAGE4-FLAG protein was present (lane 3) as well as FLAG-p53, which was used as a positive control. DNA sequence analysis revealed that PAGE4 preferentially binds to a GC-rich sequence, 5'-GCCGCGGGG-3' (Fig. 4)
These data indicate that the WT PAGE4 polypeptide chain has considerable intrinsic disorder but also has contiguous residues with propensities for β-extended conformations (ΔCα<0, ΔCβ>0; residues 14–17, 21–23, 32–34, and 38–40) and α-helical conformations (ΔCα>0, ΔCβ<0; residues 67–73). On the basis of comparison with ΔCα values for fully folded proteins, these regions are ∼10–20% transiently ordered.
*** Only partial ordering*** Using NMR spectroscopy... The population of transient turn-like structures increases upon phosphorylation in an ∼20-residue acidic region centered on Thr-51. This central region therefore becomes more compact and more negatively charged, with increasing intramolecular contacts to basic sequence motifs near the N and C termini.
Spectra for L27 monomers (Lin-2 and Lin-7 proteins) show little ellipticity at 222 nm, indicating that the individual monomers are largely unfolded.
There is a striking increase of ellipticity at 222 nm upon mixing of the monomers. The individual unfolded monomers become a stable, helical, folded unit upon association.
Difference CD spectra for the interacting pair of proteins (C.e. LIN-7:C.e. LIN-2C) show minima at 222 nm, indicative of a significant increase in α-helical content upon association.

Helix α1 and sheet β9 are linked by a disordered region between residues 101 and 110
The solved crystal structure of ToxT revealed an unstructured region in the N-terminal domain between residues 100 and 110. This region and the surrounding amino acids have been previously implicated in ToxT proteolysis, resistance to inhibition by negative effectors, and ToxT dimerization. To better characterize this region, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to assess the effects on ToxT proteolysis and bile sensitivity. This analysis identified specific mutations within this unstructured region that prevent ToxT proteolysis and other mutations that reduce inhibition by bile and unsaturated fatty acids.
To further characterize this region in regard to these roles, we performed site-directed alanine mutagenesis of ToxT amino acids 100 to 109, shown in Fig. 1.
The previously described degradation intermediate of ToxT (24) was present in cell extracts from strains carrying each of the mutations in the unstructured region between amino acids 100 and 109 except for the G100A and M103A mutant strains (Fig. 2A). Densitometry was performed using ImageJ software (Fig. 2B) and revealed that the L107A and S109A mutants also had decreased levels of degradation compared to the results for the WT. Mutations I104A and R105A resulted in increased degradation of ToxT, possibly due to decreased ToxT stability. The identification of mutations in this region affecting ToxT proteolysis both confirms previous work demonstrating the importance of amino acids 100 to 109 and pinpoints amino acids 100 and 103 as crucial for ToxT proteolysis.

As was observed in the bile experiments, mutation of residues 100 to 104, 107, and 108 caused decreased overall transcriptional activity with and without added effector. Also, the D101A, I104A, and Y108A mutants had increased sensitivity to linoleic acid, as we had observed with bile. 
This analysis revealed ToxT mutations (G100A, D101A, I104A, Y108A, and E110A) that caused greater sensitivity to the negative effect of bile.
ToxT alanine substitutions at amino acids 100 to 104, 107, and 108 caused decreased overall ToxT activity, as we observed in the bile/UFA experiments described above. Additionally, mutation of S109 and E110 caused slight decreases in overall activity compared to that of the WT. The L107A mutant was completely inactive, and bicarbonate had no activating effect on this variant of ToxT. Bicarbonate increased the activity of WT MBP-ToxT 2.6-fold in these experiments (Fig. 5). ToxT G100A, D101A, M103A, I104A, and Y108A mutants all had an increased response to the activating effect of bicarbonate. 
These results suggest that the same ToxT residues within the unstructured region from amino acid 100 to 109 may be involved in the response to both positive and negative effectors.
"Residues at the N terminus (residues 1–7) and at the C terminus (residues 121–131) are unstructured, as evidenced by a low number of inter-residue NOEs."

The conformation of the inhibitory module of Ets1 in (Ets1)2–DNA and Ets1–Pax5–DNA complexes, which do not contain Runx1, resembled that of free Ets1, although HI-1 was disordered
CaMKII-catalyzed phosphorylation of Ets1 in a
serine-rich region of the N-terminal extension of HI-1
is known to stabilize the inhibitory hydrophobic core
(Fig. 1b, f, and j), resulting in a 50- to 1000-fold
reduction in its affinity for DNA

The equivalent protein sequence of cyclin D3 (residues 255–C terminus) is not apparent in the electron density, presumably because of disorder.
N-terminal region characterized by missing electron density in the crystal structure.
We found that phosphorylation of His-cyclin D3 (wt) in vitro by GSK-3β reached a stoichiometry of approximately 0.6 mol phosphate per mol of His-cyclin D3 (wt) (data not shown), indicating that GSK-3β effectively phosphorylates cyclin D3 in vitro. To determine whether Thr-283 in cyclin D3 is phosphorylated by GSK-3β, a bacterially produced His-tagged cyclin D3 mutant containing an Ala for Thr-283 substitution [His-cyclin D3 (T283A)] was used as a substrate in an in vitro kinase reaction with purified GSK-3β. Fig. 6B shows that GSK-3β phosphorylated His-cyclin D3 (wt) but not His-cyclin D3 (T283A).
Taken together, these results indicate that cyclin D3 is a specific substrate for GSK-3β, and map the site of GSK-3β phosphorylation to Thr-283 in cyclin D3.

NMR studies indicate that other than the 45-residue ZBR, the 143-residue C-terminal EMI1 inhibitory region lacks fixed tertiary structure.
The APC/C inhibitory domain of EMI1 contains two intrinsically disordered segments separated by a zinc-dependent folded domain
Overall, the data suggest that EMI1DLZT is substantially intrinsically unfolded, with predominantly disordered D-box, Linker, and Tail regions separated by a folded ZBR.
Backbone resonance assignments revealed that the chemical shifts were consistently dispersed for the ZBR residues in EMI1DLZT, EMI1ZT, and EMI1Z constructs, indicating that the ZBR is an autonomously folded domain (Fig. 1b). Notably, the remaining resonances in EMI1DLZT displayed poor dispersion, low or negative {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE (HetNOE) values, and relatively lower differences in Cα chemical shifts compared to values predicted for a random coil (Fig. 1c).

To further characterize the biophysical properties of EMI1DLZT, we measured the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) to be 3.1 nm and 2.9 nm by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and analytical ultracentrifugation, respectively (Fig. 1f, g). A globular protein would have to be ~46 kDa, rather than the 16.0 kDa of EMI1DLZT to yield an Rh value of 3.1 nm by DLS. The best-fit weight-average anhydrous frictional ratio (f/f0)w values of 1.73 and 1.85 obtained from two analytical ultracentrifugation experiments indicate that EMI1DLZT is elongated in solution (Supplementary Fig. 1). Overall, the data suggest that EMI1DLZT is substantially intrinsically unfolded, with predominantly disordered D-box, Linker, and Tail regions separated by a folded ZBR.

An obvious key functional element is EMI1’s D-box. In examining the EM data, there are differences between APC/CCDH1 and the EMI1–SKP1- and EMI1DLZT-bound complexes in the vicinity of CDH1 and APC10, consistent with EMI1’s D-box binding the coreceptors (Supplemental Fig. 2). We were unable to generate stoichiometric complexes for mutants lacking EMI1’s D-box. Furthermore, alanine substitutions in place of Arg322 and Leu325 in EMI1DLZT’s D-box “RxxL” motif decreased inhibition of cycB-NT* in reactions with UBCH10 to the point that we could not measure a Ki under the initial rate conditions (Table 1). The apparent Ki increased by over two orders-of-magnitude for UbcycB-NT* ubiquitination by APC/CCDH1 and UBE2S.
The intrinsically disordered D-box, linker and tail elements, together with a structured zinc-binding domain, bind distinct regions of APC/C(CDH1) to synergistically both block the substrate-binding site and inhibit ubiquitin-chain elongation.

The apparent Ki increased by over two orders-of-magnitude for UbcycB-NT* ubiquitination by APC/CCDH1 and UBE2S.
The functional importance of intrinsic structural disorder is explained by the D-box, Linker, ZBR, and Tail synergistically blocking both Ub ligation to a substrate and Ub chain elongation by APC/C.
The intrinsically disordered D-box, linker and tail elements, together with a structured zinc-binding domain, bind distinct regions of APC/C(CDH1) to synergistically both block the substrate-binding site and inhibit ubiquitin-chain elongation. 
The functional importance of intrinsic structural disorder is explained by enabling a small inhibitory domain to bind multiple sites to shut down multiple functions of a “molecular machine” nearly 100 times its size.
Although the Ki for full-length EMI1 increased substantially, presumably due to lack of its D-box recruitment by CDH1, the isolated EMI1 Tail inhibited APC/C-UBE2S-mediated ubiquitination of UbcycB-NT* equally well in the presence or absence of CDH1 (Table 1, Fig. 6a, b).
The functional importance of intrinsic structural disorder is explained by enabling a small inhibitory domain to bind multiple sites to shut down multiple functions of a “molecular machine” nearly 100 times its size.
The indifference to CDH1 implied that the isolated EMI1 Tail targets a catalytic function of APC/C-UBE2S independently of blocking APC/C binding to a D-box substrate.
Furthermore, between the EM data showing EMI1 contacting the APC/C Catalytic core and biochemical data analyzing reactions inhibited by EMI1, we also uncovered a function for the unstructured C-terminal tail of EMI1 in blocking catalysis of Ub chain elongation by UBE2S
Prompted by the structural data showing that an insertion maps to the central location between the D-box coreceptor APC10, the Arc lamp, and the Platform (Fig. 4a), we considered that the Linker might be functionally important. Indeed, the Linker is not simply a spatial connector joining the D-box and ZBR effectors: deleting 20 Linker residues impairs EMI1DLZT-mediated inhibition, which is not restored by replacement with a 20-residue glycine-rich sequence (Fig. 4c, d). As a first attempt to address whether this sequence or structure may be important, we tested two 10-residue deletions, and found only one to be severely impaired for inhibition. Triply mutating conserved Leu345, Tyr356, and Arg358 within the essential sequence to alanines, either in the context of the benign 10-residue deletion or in EMI1DLZT, is sufficient to substantially impair inhibition. Thus, specific side-chains within the Linker contribute to inhibition (Fig. 4d).

The F58A mutant inhibits binding to the LDS of LC3C.

In contrast to the Tat-P-TEFb complex, in which the CycT1 TRM is disordered between residues 253 and 260, this functionally important segment is ordered in two conformations in the Tat-AFF4-P-TEFb complex.
CycT1 L252 forms hydrophobic interactions with AFF4 M55 in all three complexes. The TRM structures start to diverge at this point. CycT1 residues 253–259 loop over Tat helix 28–33 in two conformations that converge at CycT1 C261....In all complexes, W256 makes buried contacts with AFF4.
The presence of multiple conformations and relatively weak electron density for the TRM loop residues 253–260 indicates that this region is conformationally restrained but still quite flexible after Tat and AFF4 binding. These results suggest that in the presence of Tat, AFF4 partially orders the TRM.
The lack of electron density in the PDB indicates this region is disordered.
Tandem  alanine  replacements  in  residues  3–32,  which  flank  the ordered  CycT1  contacts  in  the  crystal  structure,  showed  significant  but generally  smaller effects  on AFF4 transcriptional stimulation activity. These results implicate the P-TEFb binding site, as well as the flanking flexible sequences, in the function of the AFF4 N-terminal segment.
Residues 2–73 of AFF4, for example, are sufficient to bind P-TEFb through the CycT1 subunit, and a peptide encompassing AFF42–73 folds upon binding CycT1.
AFF41–300, AFF4300–600, and AFF4600–900 were hypersensitive to proteinase K (Fig. 2B). Limited proteolysis failed to produce large, stable fragments of these AFF4 polypeptides, suggesting intrinsic disorder over the entire sequence.

In general, the structure of the Cx45, Cx43, and Cx40 CT domains are predominantly intrinsically disordered with varying degrees of a-helical content... The Cx45CT domain contains the largest amount of a-helical structure (19% total a-helical content), which is within one region (A333-N361).
The data are characteristic of a protein that contains both a-helical and random coil structures... The CD data indicate that Cx45CT residues A333-N361 are predominantly a-helical.
all of the molecular partners studied here interacted in the intrinsically disordered regions of the Cx45CT

ZF1 and ZF2 are well-struc- tured, nearly identical in their folds (rmsd 1⁄4 1.1 Å), and are con- nected via a 22-residue linker (residues 399–420), which appears to be largely flexible thus causing some degree of freedom in the domain orientation
Collectively, our structure and NMR data show that APLF TZF is made up with two relatively independent domains connected by a largely flexible linker due to the high degree of internal mobility of residues G406–D416.
All backbone amide protons resonate in a narrow
spectral region between 7.8 and 8.7 ppm, indicating
that APLFAD is mostly unstructured in solution.
We have performed structural investigation
on the recognition of H2A-H2B dimers and we present evidence that APLF can function as a true H2AH2B
chaperone.
We find that APLFAD binds comparably to both (H3-
H4)2 and H2A-H2B, implying that APLF is a generic histone
chaperone without specificity for either type of histone
complex.
It exhibits a reduced chemical shift dispersion, especially in the 1H dimension between 8.5 and 7.5 ppm (Fig. 1C), which is a characteristic of the intrinsically disordered proteins (42).
We carried out detailed characterization of a 199-aa-long CHIKV HVD by NMR spectroscopy at atomic resolution. The results revealed the absence of stable secondary structures in this domain and clearly demonstrated that CHIKV HVD was present in solution in a disordered conformation.

 In vertebrate cells, CHIKV HVD also coimmunoprecipitated cellular SH3-binding proteins BIN1, CD2AP, and SH3KBP1. In mosquito C7/10 cells, it interacted with A0A182G3T6, the mosquito BIN1 homolog (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, isolation of CD2AP/SH3KBP1 and BIN1 was strongly dependent on the cell type. In human Huh7 and mouse NIH 3T3 cells (35), BIN1, but not CD2AP or SH3KBP1, efficiently interacted with CHIKV HVD. However, in another human cell line, HEK 293 cells, CHIKV HVD preferentially interacted with CD2AP and SH3KBP1, but not with BIN1.
In the case of CHIKV, G3BP binding is particularly critical. In contrast to the results of the studies performed on SINV and SFV, deletion of even a single element of the G3BP-binding HVD repeat had a strong negative effect on CHIKV replication in both vertebrate and mosquito cells (Fig. 2) (34). Deletion of both elements, in turn, completely abrogated virus replication.

These experimental data strongly suggested that HVDs play critical roles in the adaptation of CHIKV and EILV to replication in particular cell types. Despite having very similar G3BP-binding repeating peptides, heterologous HVDs changed cell specificities of replication for both viruses. This was a strong support for the hypothesis that HVD fragments located upstream of the carboxy-terminal G3BP/Rin-binding repeat play an indispensable role in CHIKV replication.

Western blot analysis with NAP1L1-specific Abs also definitively detected the latter protein in the co-IP samples generated on the cells infected with VEErep/Flag-GFP-ABCD but not with any other constructs, including VEErep/Flag-GFP-ABC and VEErep/Flag-GFP-123D (Fig. 8B). The most plausible explanation for the lack of NAP1L1 binding to CHIKV HVD deletion mutant constructs was that NAP1L1 binding requires the presence of intact aa sequences of both fragments C and D. Indeed, two isoforms of NAP1L1 were readily detectable in the samples generated from the cells infected with replicons expressing Flag-GFP-12CD and Flag-GFP-12(C3)D fusions (Fig. 8C). This was an indication that NAP1L1 interacts with HVD on the border between C and D fragments (see Fig. 11).

The assignment data unambiguously proved that CHIKV HVD is disordered in solution (Supplementary Fig. 2) and allowed us to characterize in detail its interactions with the SH3-binding domains of CD2AP protein.
The most significant changes in the chemical shift (2 standard deviations, 2σ) were found in three sites: aa 70–83 (Site 1), aa 101–111 (Site 2) and aa 164–172 (Site 3).
As was found for Site 1, the resonances of the residues in the docking site (aa 101–105) for SH3-A and SH3-B complexes were broadening with increasing concentration of the SH3 domains. The signals also became undetectable at saturation point (Supplementary Fig. 9). For the SH3-C complex, the corresponding 1H–15N correlation peaks moved linearly towards the chemical shifts of the bound state.
However, in the experiments with SH3-All, the Site 2-specific signals of residues 101 to 105 were already not detected at the first point of titration, at ratio 0.1:1 (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 9). This was an indication of a stronger affinity of SH3-All, compared to those of the individual domains. For aa 108R-111L, the CSP trajectories and their maximums were identical to the CSP signatures observed for binding of the SH3-A domain to CHIKV HVD (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 10).

Quite unexpectedly, the CD spectrum of DCL1-A indicates
that the polypeptide is disordered
we
found that the 1H-15N-HMQC spectrum ofDCL1-A shows
a very limited dispersion, confirming that this domain does
not fold by itself
The protein
is intrinsically disordered, but it can still perform its
expected role, binding dsRNA
We found that both constructs do bind ds-
DNA, showing that DCL1-A is also peculiar in terms of
nucleic acid recognition with respect to other dsRBDs.
These experiments
indicate that DCL1-A folding is specifically induced
by dsRNA.
NOESY-15N-HSQC spectra of the protein show few NOE crosspeaks, corresponding to intra and i-1 correlations, further supporting the absence of a stable structure.
We employed SAXS data to obtain information on global shape of the ensemble. The Kratky plot shows the typical features of disordered proteins.

Intrinsic disorder
of full-length Ntr2 was also reflected in its 1H-15NHSQC
NMR spectrum
Together
with the peptide SPOT analysis, the results presented above
show that the N-terminal half of Ntr2 encompasses three
Brr2-binding regions, of which the first two regions (within
residues 1–75) are necessary and sufficient for stable Brr2
binding in SEC.
CD spectra of
both Ntr2FL and the N-terminal half of the protein (residues
1–162: Ntr21–162) at 20  C showed a global minimum at
around 200 nm, lacked a CD signal at 190 nm, and exhibited
a flat region in the 210–230 nm range (Fig. 1 B), which are
typical signatures of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)
The hydrodynamic
radii of Ntr2FL, Ntr21–162, and Ntr21–75 derived from
quasi-elastic light scattering were in excellent agreement
with the expected values for IDPs
The 2D [1H,15N]-HSQC spectrum
of 15N-labelled Tarp726–825, a construct containing the G-actin binding domain (Fig. 1), shows extremely narrow
spectral dispersion in the 1H dimension of the backbone amide chemical shifts (majority of peaks within
~0.7 ppm). This is a typical characteristic of an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP).
Tarp binds G-actin with high affinity and increases in helical content
Furthermore, NMR experiments in the presence of G-actin indicate this interaction affects the proposed WH2-like α-helical region, supporting results from in silico docking calculations which suggest that, when folded, this α-helix binds within the actin hydrophobic cleft as seen for other actin-associated proteins.
The SRCD spectrum of Tarp726–825 (Supplementary Fig. S4) is also consistent with a secondary structure that is primarily instrinsically disordered. Furthermore, thermal-melt SRCD studies of the construct also show behaviour typical of an IDP: the spectral changes (increase in the 224 nm shoulder and decrease in the peak around 190 nm, Supplementary Fig. S4) correspond to a decreased calculated disordered content with increasing temperature, a behaviour that directly contrasts with that seen for most fully folded (not IDP) proteins.
Taken together, in the present study we have shown using the experimental data at single residue resolution level that PAGE5, a member of GAGE family proteins, is an intrinsically highly disordered protein.
R-motifs bind to a region of NPM1 which includes the OD and a short disordered region (residues 1–130; termed N130; Figure 2a). The interactions engage two highly conserved acidic tracts, termed A1 (residues 34–39) and A2 (residues 120–130)
Titration of four R-motif-containing peptides (Table 1) caused phase separation into liquid-like droplets (Figure 1b and Videos 1–4) at critical concentrations that varied with R-motif composition and affinity for N130 (Table 2 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). At 200 µM N130, upon titration of the divalent rpL5 peptide, phase separation was observed when the rpL5:N130 ratio reached ~3:1 (Figure 2b).
The spectrum recorded for His-B23.1 -ΔN showed negative peaks at ~222 and 200 nm (purple line). Because negative peaks at 222 and 208 nm and that at 200 nm are indicative of α-helix and random-coil structure, respectively, we inferred that His-B23.1 -ΔN contained both α-helix and random-coil structures.
When the sequences adjacent to CTD were elongated (His-B23.1-CR and His-B23.1 -ΔN), the peak at 208 nm shifted to ~200 nm. In addition, the spectrum of His-B23.2 -ΔN (acidic and basic regions with a short portion of CTD) showed a negative peak at 200 nm (Figure 2D, red purple line). These results indicated that the central region of B23 containing acidic and basic regions was disordered in solution. 
Consistent with this result, GST pull-down assays showed that GST-B23.1-CR1 efficiently precipitated both 18S and 28S rRNA but GST-B23.1-CR1.5 and GST did so inefficiently (data not shown).
The phosphorylation sites, threonine 199, 219, 234 and 237, are located in bIDR.
Conversely, deletion of the C-terminal 35 amino acids (DC35) decreases the ribonuclease activity of the protein almost 2 fold, whereas deletion of 132 amino acids from the C-terminal end of the protein (DC132) reduces the activity by about 3–4-fold.
These results suggest that the central portion of protein B23 and the C-terminal end play crucial roles in maintaining the ribonuclease activity.
Titration of four R-motif-containing peptides (Table 1) caused phase separation into liquid-like droplets (Figure 1b and Videos 1–4) at critical concentrations that varied with R-motif composition and affinity for N130 (Table 2 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). At 200 µM N130, upon titration of the divalent rpL5 peptide, phase separation was observed when the rpL5:N130 ratio reached ~3:1 (Figure 2b).
R-motifs bind to a region of NPM1 which includes the OD and a short disordered region (residues 1–130; termed N130; Figure 2a).
Since N130 consists of a folded pentameric core and disordered N- and C-termini, proper sampling of the relaxation profiles was necessary. Therefore, experiments were recorded with different delay times for resonances from the folded core and the disordered N- and C-termini.
Although the N- and C-termini remain disordered, the N-terminus exhibits increased rigidity as indicated by the changes in S2 values and whose relaxation behavior was best described using the globally determined τc that was fixed during the LS-MF analysis (Figure 4c,i).
The 1 H-NMR spectrum showed weak dispersion and crowded peaks of amide proton chemical shifts around the 8-ppm region. The results of the NMR study indicated that the CagA C-terminal fragment (residues 877-1186) is virtually free from a high-order structure.
Far-UV CD spectrum of CagA-R showed a single sharp minimum at around 203 nm and a relatively low ellipticity above 210 nm, indicative of poorly structured conformations with low content of secondary structure, a feature that is often attributed to intrinsically disordered proteins of premolten globule (PMG) type.
CagA-R was fully degraded to small peptides within 30 min of digestion, indicating that all the potential trypsin cleavage sites are exposed and, therefore, CagA-R is either fully unfolded or intrinsically disordered.
Our gel filtration studies suggested that CagA-R is a PMG type intrinsically disordered protein.
The forward and reverse melting curves for CagA-R were not sigmoidal, as for typical folded proteins, but progressive,
indicating no obvious structural cooperativity of unfolding. The CD spectra of CagA-R prior to heating and after cooling back to 22°C were very similar, indicating that the thermal unfolding is reversible.
The electron density map obtained from the CagA(1-876) crystal resolved the N terminus end region of CagA (residues 24-221), which corresponded to the smaller fragment of the trypsin-digested CagA N-terminal region (Figure 1A).
Whereas the overall structure was defined, N-terminal CagA was characterized by the existence of short disordered stretches such as residues 222-302, 479-488, and 510-536, of which electron densities were not observed in any crystal form (Figure 4 and Table S2).

On the other hand, no electron densities were observed for residues 825-876, suggesting that these residues were structurally disordered. We thus concluded that the entire CagA protein comprises a structured N-terminal region (residues 1-829) (Table S2) and an intrinsically disordered C-terminal region (830-1186).
Domain I, which comprises the CagA N-terminal end, is linked to Domain II by a disordered region with about 80 amino acids.
Flexible linker connecting Domain I and Domain II of CagA.
Interestingly, the structured N-terminal CagA still contains short disordered regions such as residues 222-302, 479-488, and 510-536. Since these disordered regions are common in all crystal forms, their presence may be a unique structural property of N-terminal CagA. Such disordered regions would not only act as flexible linkers between structured portions/domains but also serve as sites for molecular interaction, modification and so on.
Flexible linker connecting Domain II and Domain III of CagA.
CagA(877-1186) produced in COS-7 cells or in E. coli was mixed with FLAG-tagged PAR1b expressed in COS-7 cells and the complex formation was determined by co-immunoprecipitation.
Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, we directly measured binding affinity of recombinant CagA to PAR1 (Figure 2A). Full-length CagA bound to PAR1b (residues 39-364) with a KD value of 3.9 ± 0.64 nM. In contrast, C-terminal CagA(877-1186) bound to PAR1b (KD = 33.0 ± 9.3 nM) with a strength that was one order of magnitude less than that of full-length CagA. Since N-terminal CagA(1-876) did not directly bind to PAR1, the result suggested the presence of a functional interplay between the N-terminal region and C-terminal region that strengthens binding of C-terminal CagA to PAR1.
In addition, results of a binding-competition experiment using a series of peptides derived from C-terminal CagA and a co-immunoprecipitation experiment using internal deletion mutants of CagA(877-1186) indicated that residues 998-1038 are responsible for interaction with N-terminal CagA (Figures 2D–2F).
Whereas CBS contained neither an EPIYA motif nor CM sequence, a CagA mutant lacking CBS (CagAΔ998-1038) had substantially reduced SHP2-binding activity and decreased hummingbird-inducing activity in AGS cells (Figure 2H), providing additional evidence for the importance of intramolecular CagA interaction in enhancing the pathophysiological activity of C-terminal CagA.
Authors defined region 998-1038 as C-terminal binding sequence (CBS).
Domain III interacts intramolecularly with the intrinsically disordered C-terminal region, and this interaction potentiates the pathogenic scaffold/hub function of CagA.

The C-terminal CagA(877-1186) contains the EPIYA segment and CM sequence, which respectively act as binding sites for SHP2 and PAR1 (Higashi et al., 2002b; Saadat et al., 2007). The scaffold/hub function of C-terminal CagA is responsible for the morphogenetic activity of CagA known as the hummingbird phenotype (Bagnoli et al., 2005; Higashi et al., 2005).
By circular dichroism (CD) spectrum analysis of E. coli-purified recombinant proteins, the N-terminal CagA(1-876) fragment gave particular CD peaks at 208 nm and 222 nm derived from α helices, and the helix content was estimated from CD spectra data to be approximately 58%, whereas the C-terminal CagA(877-1186) was virtually free of a secondary structure (Figure 6H).
Here, we reveal that a 276-residue DSCR construct of human desmoglein 1 is intrinsically disordered and forms an interaction hub for desmosomal proteins. In solution, it contains 6.5% helical and 10.3% beta-strand structure based on circular dichroism spectroscopy. A single monomeric state with a predominantly unfolded structure is found by size-exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation. Thermal stability assays and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal a nonglobular structure under a range of solution conditions.
Results from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy demonstrate that the DSCR of human Dsg1 is intrinsically disordered in solution, having little intrinsically stable structure but with inducible conformations that can be stabilized by co-solvents and micelles. Analysis of its hydrodynamic behavior demonstrates that the protein exists as a monomer and in an unfolded conformation rather than a globular form.
The spectrum exhibited only a single negative minimum at 198 nm, which suggests a disordered state (Fig. 5a). The estimated α-helical, β-strand, and turn content of the DSCR at 20 °C was 4.6%, 8.1%, and 7.6%, respectively, with the remaining 79.7% being assigned as disordered.
The far-UV CD spectra of the DSCR showed the typical pattern of disordered polypeptides, with little α-helical or β-strand structure.
Here, we reveal that a 276-residue DSCR construct of human desmoglein 1 is intrinsically disordered and forms an interaction hub for desmosomal proteins. In solution, it contains 6.5% helical and 10.3% beta-strand structure based on circular dichroism spectroscopy. A single monomeric state with a predominantly unfolded structure is found by size-exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation. Thermal stability assays and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal a nonglobular structure under a range of solution conditions.
Based on its gel filtration elution profile, the Stokes radius (Rs) of DSCR was estimated to be 41.8 Å. This compares more favorably with the theoretical value of a fully unfolded protein of 28.6 kDa (47.6 Å) than that of a globular monomer (24.6 Å). Together, these results indicate that the DSCR has the dimensions of a largely unfolded monomer.
The DSCR protein eluted as a single peak by gel filtration with an apparent molecular mass of 121 kDa based on calibration against known molecular mass standards (Fig. 3a).
The hydrodynamic properties of the DSCR inferred by gel filtration and AUC show that the protein adopts an unfolded monomeric conformation.

In contrast, the NMR signals of the DSCR were not well dispersed, with narrow, intense, and overlapped methyl proton resonances at random-coil values of 0.8 to 1.0 ppm. The backbone amide protons are almost entirely clustered between 7.9 and 8.5 ppm, with only two downfield peaks discernable at 8.70 and 9.21 ppm. The DSCR's sole Trp appeared disordered, exhibiting random-coil NɛH chemical shifts of 10.05 and 10.24 ppm, presumably due to the apparent cis–trans isomerization of its neighboring proline residues (Fig. 4). Together, this indicates a disordered region lacking in stable tertiary structure and is consistent with the largely unfolded conformation of the DSCR based on its hydrodynamic properties.
The limited dispersion of chemical shifts in the NMR spectrum confirms the absence of stable, three-dimensional structure.
Thus, the DSCR is an intrinsically disordered functional domain with an inducible structure that, along with the membrane proximal region, forms a flexible scaffold for cytoplasmic assembly at the desmosome.
We conclude that the DSCR forms an intrinsically disordered state in solution with inducible structure that, together with the MPR, forms a hub for multiple protein interactions during desmosomal cell adhesion.
These data suggest that the entire DSCR is required for its interaction with its desmosomal protein partners and forms a single functional unit that can be regulated by caspase cleavage.
Coomassie-stained GST-fused desmosomal proteins used in pull-down assays. GST-PG, GST fused to full-length PG; GST-DP, GST fused to the plakin domain of DP (residues 10–1097); GST-PKP1, GST fused to residues 6–726 of PKP1; GST-Dsc1, GST fused to the cytoplasmic domain of Dsc1 (residues 717–894).
Overall, the pull-down assays suggest that the entire Dsg1 cytoplasmic domain (i.e., MPR + DSCR) acts as a flexible scaffold for cytoplasmic complex assembly at the desmosome with a network of strong and weak protein–protein interactions.
The intrinsic plasticity of such intrinsically disordered regions is often used to mediate interactions with multiple biological targets. Indeed, this would appear to be the case for the DSCR as pull-down assays show that it is able to interact with multiple partners including PG, the plakin domain of DP, PKP1, and the cytoplasmic domain of Dsc1.
We suggest that strong interactions between some cytoplasmic desmosomal proteins (e.g., MPR and PG/PKP1) are supported by a network of weaker interactions between others (MPR and DP/Dsc1; DSCR and PG/PKP1/DP/Dsc1). This web of interactions places the desmoglein cytoplasmic domain at the heart of the desmosomal complex, thus enabling it to play important role in desmosome assembly and intercellular adhesion.

Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis confirms the flexibility and dynamic nature of NEIL1's CTD, a feature that may be critical to providing specificity for NEIL1's multiple, functional interactions.
The CD spectrum of NEIL1's C-terminal 78-residue peptide (amino acids 312–389; C78) reveals a prominently disordered structure with random-coil conformation.
To evaluate the secondary structure of the invisible segment in the N-domain, we compared the CD spectra of mvUNG and mvUNG95-370. In the far-UV CD spectra, the deletion of residues 1–94 did not change the pattern and scale of the CD spectrum in the range between 210–250 nm, indicating that residues 1–94 have a random coil conformation.
A solvent space that could accommodate residues 1–94 was insufficient in the crystal.
In contrast to the structured part of the N-domain and the motif-I, residues 1–94 in N-domain are not included in the crystal structure of mvUNG. They seem to be truncated before crystallization. Indeed, all reported crystal structures of UNG proteins display only a catalytic domain.
Activity assays and CD spectra implied that the unstructured segment (residues 1–94) in the N-domain also contributes to thermal stability and catalytic activity of mvUNG.
It seems to contribute to diverse cellular functions of UNGs. For example, the N-domain of hUNG is involved in the subcellular localization of isoforms [39] and the interaction with the DNA repair factor RPA [40, 41]. In the activity assay of the N-domain deletion mutants, mvUNG95-370 which residues 1–94 is deleted showed 55% activity, compared with full-length mvUNG (first and third bars in Fig 4b). Additional deletion of residues 95–121 reduced the activity to 15%, even though the deletion mutant contains the entire catalytic domain (first and fourth bars in Fig 4b). This result indicated that both invisible (residues 1–94) and visible (residues 95–130) segments of the N-domain are required for the intrinsic activity of mvUNG.

In addition, the C-terminal extension is predicted to be unstructured in isolation, which is confirmed by NMR spectra of Dcp2 residues 553–741 (Supplementary Figure S6A).
Both Edc3 and Scd6 use an N-terminal LSm domain to interact with helical leucine-rich sequence motifs
in Dcp2 (HLMs) (Figures 2–4). Multiple HLM sequences are present in Dcp2, close to the catalytic
domain and in the disordered C-terminal extension (Figures 1A and 3).
Here we report backbone and side-chain assignment of CtErbB2, which, together with structural predictions, confirms its intrinsically disordered nature.
The sequence of the studied protein fragment and its 1H-15N 2D HSQC spectrum are shown in Fig. 1. The low dispersion of amide-proton chemical shifts is characteristic of a highly disordered domain, as expected from the high proline, high charged residue and low hydrophobic content of the sequence.
Circular dichroism of CtErbB2 was measured at298 K and shows the characteristic signature of an IDP, with only one strong negative band at 200 nm (Fig.1B). Small angleX-ray scattering (SAXS) also supports this observation.
However, ErbB2 disordered C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (CtErbB2) remains very poorly characterized in terms of structure, dynamics and detailed functional mechanism. Yet, it is where signal transduction is triggered, via phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, and carried out, via interaction with adaptor proteins. Here we report the first description of ErbB2 disordered tail at atomic resolution using NMR, complemented by SAXS.
The scattering curve of CtErbB2 is given in Fig.1C. The Kratky plot and the distance distribution are characteristic of a disordered protein, giving a radius of gyration of 49.2 Å from the P(r) distribution. Flory theory gives the radius of gyration Rg of a polymer with N monomers, Rg=R0Nν, where R0 and ν depend on the behavior of the polymer in solution, and especially its solvation. Its applicability to denatured or disordered proteins has already been investigated

At atomic resolution, the poor dispersion of CtErbB2 proton resonances in the1H-15N HSQC spectrum is typical of an intrinsically disordered protein (Fig.1D).
Moreover, backbone N-H residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) measured in stretched acrylamide gels (1DN H, Fig.2A) are negative almost all along CtErbB2 sequence,as usually observed for denatured or disordered proteins (59,60). Overall, all the data show that CtErbB2 is an intrinsically disordered region (IDR).

Analysis of YefM levels in E. coli, before and after repression at different intervals, reveals that the YefM antitoxin is proteolytically unstable.
FTIR spectroscopy also indicates that YefM protein is random coil-structured.
The far-UV CD spectra of the purified YefM protein show a typical random coil pattern.
SPR analysis was used to quantitative determine the affinity between the YoeB toxin and the YefM11–23 peptide fragment.
an equilibrium constant (KD) of 0.4 microM was determined for the YoeB-YefM11–23complex. This dissociation constant is consistent with a specific binding between the toxin and the peptide fragment.
The N-terminal segments of the two YefM monomers form a symmetrical dimer. One of the YefM C-terminal segments (H4–S4) extending from the N-terminal dimer exclusively binds the globular YoeB monomer. The other YefM C terminus is structurally disordered.
The difference in behavior indicates that the polypeptide region from the end of the H3 helix to the C terminus is a random coil in the absence of a binding target, and undergoes a disorder-to-order transition upon binding YoeB.

HDX analysis of PGC1α220 revealed that most of the backbone amides were fully exchanged after 10 s incubation with deuterium, consistent with the predicted disorder.
SV analysis at 4 °C yields a frictional coefficient ratio (f∕f o) of 2.7 (a globular particle has an f∕f o of approximately 1.2, whereas a value greater than 1.8 indicates asymmetry in shape), indicating an extremely elongated shape.
The reduction in f∕f 0 between PGC1α220 and the binary complex (2.0 versus 1.5) is suggestive of coactivator compaction upon complex formation.
Despite being monomeric by mass as indicated by SEC-MALS, a Stokes radius of Rs of 42.9 Å  0.46 was determined, indicative of a molten-globular, extended conformation in solution.
This low level of compactness is further underscored by an Rs/Rg value of approximately 1.45 for PGC1α220, similar to that expected for a random coil. The Kratky and Porod–Debye plots (22–26) for PGC1α220 are clearly indicative of a largely disordered species lacking a well-packed core.
PGC-1α and ERRγ share tissue specificity, have overlapping functions, and demonstrate a robust physical and functional interaction.
The Kratky and Porod–Debye plots for the complex are indicative of a well-folded globular particle. Combined, these experiments indicate that PGC1α220 undergoes
a disorder-to-order transition upon docking onto the LBD, resulting in a binary complex, which is significantly more compact and structured.
CD analysis of PGC1α220 estimated only 27% native secondary structure in the activation domain.
The far-UV CD spectrum of DLL4_IC in Tris buffer shows a strong minimum at 198 nm, which is typical of disordered proteins.
The lack of chemical shift dispersion in the HN region as well as in the methyl region indicates the absence of globular structure, and the presence of little, if any, secondary structure.
Delta-4 was shown to interact through its evolutionarily conserved C-terminal motif (ATEV) with the PDZ domains of Dlg-1, the human homologue of Drosophila Discs Large protein.
We interpret size exclusion chromatography results as indicative of the presence of a monomeric, disordered but partially compact state.
All residues of OSBPF showed negative NOE values in the unbound state, suggesting that free OSBPF is flexible. Structure analysis of free OSBPF using the TALOS program with the assigned 1HN, 15N, 13C, C, and 13C chemical shifts also showed no ordered structure.
Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP), a cytosolic receptor of cholesterol and oxysterols, is recruited to the endoplasmic reticulum by binding to the cytoplasmic major sperm protein (MSP) domain of integral endoplasmic reticulum protein VAMP-associated protein-A (VAP-A).
Upon binding to VAP-AMSP, 1H,15N hetero-NOE values of the residues around the FFAT motif of OSBPF changed from negative to positive, indicating that OSBPF formed a stable structure upon binding to VAP-AMSP.
Circular dichroism of N2B showed no signs of secondary structure. This is the first experimental conformation that the cytoplasmic domain is disordered.
We were able to express and purify to homogeneityCTD2 (residues1259–1482) which contains the CAMKII and PSD-95 binding sites.
Limited trypsin proteolysis of CTD2 with 2 g/ml trypsin resulted in complete degradation in less than 30 min as
expected for a disordered protein. High molecular weight intermediate bands are visible at early time points indicating
that some cleavage sites are partially protected.
Although theCTDis intrinsically disordered, it exerts allosteric effects on receptor gating and trafficking that are modulated through Src phosphorylation, which alters both channel currents and receptor trafficking.
Although the constructs sample different regions of CTD2, there was little dispersion in the FRET peaks suggesting a lack of local structure.
Analytical SEC of N2B gave an RH of 3.27 ± 0.021 nm for an apparent molecular weight of 70.4 ± 1.2 kDa compared with the actual molecular weight of 25.3 kDa.

The 1H NMR spectrum of ShB-C lacks the chemical shift dispersion typical of folded proteins. Hence, our results suggest that the C-terminal portion of the Shaker channel is an intrinsically disordered random chain.
His6-tagged ShB-C, immobilized on Ni2 beads via its N terminus, is able to capture PSD-95 from a crude soluble protein extract of transformed Drosophila Schneider cells.
The far-UV CD spectrum for ShB-C lacked the typical signatures of secondary structure. ShB-C exhibited a negative peak at 200
nm, indicative of a strong contribution from disordered structural elements, characteristic of a protein in a random coil
conformation.
Thus, we conclude that ShB-C behaves as a random coil with very low compactness. Dynamic light
scattering further supports this conclusion, yielding a Stokes radius of 37.2 Å.
CD spectrum in the near-UV range (250–330 nm) was devoid of any ellipticity (not shown), indicating the absence of
oriented aromatic residues typically present in the hydrophobic cores of compact globular proteins.
ShB-C migrates in a size-exclusion column unusually fast for a 15.9-kDa protein. Thus, we conclude that ShB-C

In PMID: 20413501 the same group states in the supplementary material based on this work: NusG-CTD (132-181; green; PDB ID: 2JVV; (16)) is connected

This
observation suggests that (1) EcNusG consists of at
least two domains that are connected via a flexible
linker.
The sequence region P45–F65 shows
chemical shifts typical for unstructured residues and no medium- or long-range nuclear Overhauser

In the 1D 1H-NMR spectrum of Gli-cyt in H2O, the chemical shifts are in the narrow range between 0.8 and 8.5 ppm, demonstrating that Gli-cyt exists in solution as a mixture of rapidly equilibrating extended conformers.
The experimentally determined RST for Gli-cyt, 33.4 Å, is significantly larger than expected for either the native orMGstates. However, it is significantly lower than
expected for a random coil, suggesting that it may be in a PMG state.
The far-UV CD spectrum of Gli-cyt displays a maximum negative ellipticity at 200 nm and a low ellipticity at 222 nm, which are indicative of a strong contribution from disordered structural elements.
SNARE motifs are unstructured in solution, but assume a helical conformation when they interact with each other. Using circular dichroism (CD, 220 nm) spectroscopy, we therefore investigated which of the possible combinations of early endosomal SNARE motifs result in increases in α‐helicity. As expected for SNARE core complexes, combination of all four SNARE motifs resulted in a major increase of α‐helical content.
The crystal structure of the early endosomal SNARE complex (composed of syntaxin 13, vti1a, syntaxin 6, and VAMP4) was solved and refined at a resolution of 2.7 Å. The overall structure revealed that the SNARE complex forms a four‐helix bundle with a left‐handed superhelical twist.
The combination of all four SNARE motifs (syntaxin 13, vti1a, syntaxin 6, and VAMP4) resulted in a major increase of α‐helical content.

Snc2p appears to be unfolded as judged by CD spectroscopy and amide proton exchange experiments, in accord with previous reports for Snc2p homologs. Therefore, the SNARE regions that form binary and ternary complexes efficiently all seem, individually, to lack significant regular secondary structure.
The addition of Snc2p to Sso1CT–Sec9CT binary complexes resulted in a further large increase in α-helix content, to a total value of greater than 85%. The high helix content of the ternary complex suggests strongly that Snc2p folds to adopt an α-helical structure upon binding to the binary t-SNARE complex and that one or both t-SNAREs also adopt additional helical structure.

Binary complexes form between the target membrane SNAREs Sso1p and Sec9p; these binary complexes can subsequently bind to the vesicle SNARE Snc2p to form ternary complexes.
Binary and ternary SNARE complex formation induces the folding of unstructured SNARE domains.
Ternary complexes form upon addition of the cytoplasmic domain of the post-Golgi v-SNARE Snc2p (Fig. 1c), as has been seen for the functionally redundant (and 83% identical) Snc1p.
Unlike Sso1p and Sso2p, which display CD spectra indicative of substantial (∼70%) α-helix content, Sso1CT and Sso2CT are largely unfolded. Therefore, the SNARE regions that form binary and ternary complexes efficiently all seem, individually, to lack significant regular secondary structure.
A dramatic acquisition of α-helical secondary structure accompanied the combination of Sso1CT and Sec9CT, with the final α-helix content of ∼60%. [...] The observed spectrum for Sso1CT–Sec9CT differs significantly from that anticipated for a non-interacting mixture, indicating that binary complex formation is coupled to significant folding of one or both of the largely-unstructured t-SNARE domains.

The model included the full dimer with the exception of the C-terminal residues beyond Met208. The C-terminal helix has been omitted from the apo-structure due to the absence of any associated electron density.
It would appear, that the presence of a hydrophobic substrate, or possibly just glutathione, stabilizes the helix. ... It seems that the environment around Phe220 (which includes Tyr9, a residue of some importance to the catalytic mechanism) is critical in determining whether the helix is ordered or not.
This helix, one edge of which is made up of hydrophobic residues, forms a lid over the H-site, providing a highly hydrophobic environment for the substrate, and has been shown to be important, though not essential, in catalysis.
Already the narrow signal dispersion of the HSQC spectrum of the RSK1(683–735) peptide informed us about the disordered nature of this free RSK1 tail fragment.
Overlay of the HSQC spectra of the free and S100B complexed 15N-labeled RSK1(683–735) peptide. Addition of excess S100B resulted in changes in the spectrum. As changes were monitored from the 15N RSK1 peptide side (S100B protein was unlabeled), the consequence of complex formation would be observable as shifted and broadened peaks and also peaks broadened below the detection limit in the HSQC spectrum.
Deconvolution of the difference spectra by the program BeStSel reveals an ∼13-amino acid-long single helix in the bound state of RSK1(683–735), while the free peptide is completely disordered.
An increase in the helical content of RSK1(683-735) upon complex formation can be observed in the CD spectra without major changes in the S100B structure itself.
PepRSK1 contains a reverse D-­motif from a downstream MAP kinase-activated protein kinase (MAPKAP) that is a known ERK2 substrate. The bound peptides (e.g. pepRSK1) were not involved in crystal packing in the new cocrystals. For flexible linear motifs this is more favourable in order to capture them in their physiologically relevant binding geometry.

Ras‐ERK pathway activation influences RSK‐PDZ substrate interaction and activator MAP kinase binding by using an autoregulatory phosphoswitch located in the disordered RSK C‐terminal tail
However, the endothermic nature of binding between the PDZ domain and the longer RSK1712–735 (or RSK1696–735) peptide suggests that some degree of disordered‐to‐order transition occurs in the CTT upon phosphorylation
Phosphorylation mediates intramolecular interactions in their free disordered state, which then represents a kinetic barrier for their binding to interaction partners
However, the C‐terminal region following the MAPK docking motif was disordered (729–735) in that structure, preventing the observation of possible contacts between the autophosphorylatable Ser732 and the ERK2 interaction surface.
Autophosphorylation of the disordered CTT promotes the formation of an intramolecular charge clamp, which efficiently masks critical residues and indirectly hinders ERK binding.

Aside from K62, amide cross peaks are absent from W56 to D71 suggesting that the C-terminal region is unstructured in solution.
Superposition of the ensemble of 20 lowest energy structures calculated for Rv2377c. Because both the N- and C-terminal regions are disordered, G1* - A12 and W56 - D71, respectively, most of these regions have been removed from the Figure for clarity.

In gel filtration experiments, the HP0222 migrated as a molecule with a molecular mass of approximately 35 kD, and the HP0222str migrated as a 13 kDa molecule. The larger‐than‐expected apparent size of HP0222 in the above experiments was the result of the 42‐residue‐long (12 residue His‐tag and the first 30 residues of HP0222) unstructured N‐terminal sequences.
Light scattering experiments on HP0222 indicated molecular size of approximately 40 kDa. The larger‐than‐expected apparent size of HP0222 in the above experiments was the result of the 42‐residue‐long (12 residue His‐tag and the first 30 residues of HP0222) unstructured N‐terminal sequences.
We measured a two-dimensional (2D) 1H-15N heteronuclear correlation (HSQC) spectrum of scSte5 RH2 in standard conditions. The broad signals, indicating exchange between several conformations and the small chemical shift dispersion, are typical for a molten globule. A spectrum of the domain in yeast extracts is very similar, thus suggesting that scSte5 RH2 may exist as a molten globule in vivo.
Overall, our structural analysis shows that the molten globule of scSte5 RH2 comprises disordered parts and regions with predominantly regular secondary structure elements. ... These changes provide evidence that, upon interaction with the Ste4/Ste18 heterodimer, the active form of scSte5 RH2 escapes the molten globule state at least partially and adopts a better-defined and less-dynamic structure.
The physiological binding partners are the beta (Ste4) and gamma (Ste18) subunits of the G protein. Binding was monitored by [1H,15N]-HSQC NMR spectroscopy. Upon interaction with the binding partners, scSte5 RH2 underwent a dramatic conformational rearrangement.
The diffuse non-cooperative nature melting transition indicates a heterogeneous ensemble of conformations that are characteristic for a molten globule state. The scSte5 RH2 exhibits very high thermal stability. The slope of the molar heat capacity as a function of temperature is appr. four times larger than typical values for folded proteins.
At pH 2, 20 °C, and a protein concentration of 64 µ , Arc is unfolded by the following criteria: (i) the circular dichroism spectrum shows very little secondary structure and increased random coil content compared with native Arc (Figure 1A); (ii) the fluorescence spectrum of the single tryptophan at position 14 is red shifted and shows reduced intensity compared to native Arc (Figure IB); and (iii) the protein behaves as a monomer in sedimentation equilibrium experiments (av Mw 5560), whereas native Arc is a dimer (av Afw 12 346) (Figure 1C).
In the structure of the globular Arc dimer, each monomer is interwound with the other, forming a single folded domain with a conventional hydrophobic core.

At pH 2, 20 °C, and a protein concentration of 64 µ , Arc is unfolded by the following criteria: (i) the circular dichroism spectrum shows very little secondary structure and increased random coil content compared with native Arc (Figure 1A); (ii) the fluorescence spectrum of the single tryptophan at position 14 is red shifted and shows reduced intensity compared to native Arc (Figure IB); and (iii) the protein behaves as a monomer in sedimentation equilibrium experiments (av Mw 5560), whereas native Arc is a dimer (av Afw 12 346) (Figure 1C).
We performed a combination of NMR experiments and computer simulations to investigate the structural and dynamical consequences of introducing negative charge at a site in the gamma-tubulin CT(439-473)  that is phosphorylated in vivo. The results derived from the two techniques were remarkably similar. Both showed that the WT gamma-CT is largely unstructured.
The in vivo phosphorylation of an evolutionarily conserved Tyr (Y445) residue in the gamma-tubulin orthologue of the budding yeast was identified. Mutation of Y445 to an acidic residue alters microtubule dynamics and perturbs the function of the mitotic spindle but does not appear to alter microtubule nucleation, suggesting the S.c. gamma-CT may function in postnucleation organization and function of microtubules.
The initial construct corresponding to the predicted Ste50p-RA domain [235-327] showed a well-dispersed 1H-15N HSQC spectrum indicative of a folded protein, with the exception of the N-terminal region that was unfolded. Further analyses using heteronuclear NOE experiments confirmed this finding and showed that Ste50p(250-327) behaved as folded.
Sequence analysis predicted that the cytoplasmic tail of Opy2p is intrinsically unstructured. This prediction was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy of a recombinant 15N-enriched fragment of Opy2p encompassing amino acid residues 194-333, which showed a 1H-15N HSQC spectrum indicative of an unstructured polypeptide.
We have previously shown that the region of the C-terminal tail of Opy2p consisting of amino acids residues 267-345 physically interacts with Ste50p, and we have termed this region SID (for Ste50p interacting domain; Wu et al., 2006 blue right-pointing triangle).
NOE data and chemical shift differences from random coil values (60) support the random coil nature of the linker (Figs. ​(Figs.22 and supplemental S4). Furthermore, the backbone chemical shifts of the linker are consistent with a highly flexible backbone, according to the random coil index (65) (supplemental Fig. S5).
The tertiary organization of the free Pax-8 DNA binding domain shows the characteristics of a canonical Prd domain: two HTH motifs are connected by an unstructured linker region. NOE data and chemical shift differences from random coil values (60) support the random coil nature of the linker (Figs. ​(Figs.22 and supplemental S4). Furthermore, the backbone chemical shifts of the linker are consistent with a highly flexible backbone, according to the random coil index (65) (supplemental Fig. S5).
Additionally, the random coil index indicates a random coil-like structure and high backbone flexibility for the C- and N-terminal regions flanking the two HTH domains.

When the pure Pax-6 paired domain was analyzed by CD spectroscopy, a spectrum with relative minima at 208 and 222 nm was observed. Although this could be consistent with a very small amount of alpha-helical structure, thermal denaturation CD studies failed to show a cooperative transition, consistent with the protein being largely unstructured.
However, when a 36-base pair oligonucleotide containing a sequence selected by the Pax-6 paired domain was added to the solution, the CD spectrum of the protein-DNA complex revealed decreased minima at 208 and 222 nm consistent with a marked increase in alpha-helical content.
CD spectra demonstrate that the RED subdomain alone does not have significant secondary structure. Furthermore, the presence of PEG 6000 or Ficoll‐70 does not noticeably increase the secondary structure.
Atypical mobility of pure NRG1-III-Nct on SDS-PAGE was observed, which is an indication of a disordered nature of the protein.
Two types of synchroton SAXS experiments were done: a highly concentrated batch of the protein was directly analysed, and the protein was also subjected to an online SAXS experiment on a SEC column. The featureless scattering curve suggests a lack of globular folded domains, which is confirmed by the Kratky plot, clearly lacking any defined maximum characteristic for a folded protein.
The folding of NRG1-III-Nct was studied by SRCD spectroscopy. In aqueous solution, the protein showed a typical spectrum for disordered proteins, with a strong negative minimum at 200 nm. This result fits well to the sequence-based predictions of disorder.
To investigate metal binding by NRG1-III-Nct, ITC experiments were performed. The binding assays showed that the protein binds to Zn2+ as well as to Ni2+ with a dissociation constant Kd in the low micromolar range. The results, together with SRCD data, as well as the structural predictions, suggest a specific metal-binding site in the juxtamembrane segment of NRG1-III-Nct. The stoichiometries indicate 1:1 binding.
Synhrotron radiation circular dichroism (SRCD) spectra were recorded for full-length juxtanodin and truncated variants. All spectra exhibited a negative minimum close to 200 nm and a relatively low ellipticity above 210 nm, a typical observation for disordered proteins.
Juxtanodin, also called ermin, is a 282-residue actin-binding protein, which co-localizes with filamentous actin (F-actin) and promotes the formation of cell protrusions during the differentiation of oligodendrocytes.
The mmunoblotting results showed a discrepancy between the calculated molecular mass (32.2 kDa) and the actual migration of JN on SDS/PAGE. Further tests attributed this atypical migration of JN largely to its residues 101-247. In vitro expression of FLAG-tagged JN, JN247, JN141, and JNc yielded products that, on Western blots, measured heavier than predicted by 30%, 41%, 16%, and 44%, respectively.
The SLS analysis clearly illustrates that juxtanodin is monomeric in solution, with a molecular weight of 32 kDa, which is essentially identical to the expected value of 32.2 kDa for a monomer. The small elution volume indicates a large hydrodynamic radius, i.e. juxtanodin has an extended and non-globular shape.
We performed SAXS experiments. The Rg values derived from the Guinier plot, the distance distribution functions and Debye functions showed highly extended particle shapes. The large maximum particle dimensions (Dmax) also support a disordered nature. The Kratky plot revealed the typical behavior of disordered proteins, with a short plateau followed by a monotonic increase, and the lack of a clear maximum.

The crystal structure of the SycH-YopH complex has been solved.
In the crystals, SycH and YopH  interact with a 1:1 stoichiometry.
The spectrum of FBP 21276–376 showed very low chemical shift dispersion, consistent with an intrinsically disordered protein region (IDPR)
The spectrum of the complex suggests that the FBP21 fragment globally retains its unstructured nature when bound to Brr2C-Sec63 and does not adopt a stable fold upon complex formation.

Our data show that the far-UV CD spectrum of the PR domain is characterized by a negative band centered around
208 nmin the absence of denaturants (Fig. 3a and b). This strongly suggests that the PR domain predominantly adopts a randomcoil-like conformation.
in solution
Our hydrodynamic data further substantiate the notion that the PR domain likely adopts a random coil-like conformation in solution.
The Kratky plots for the PR domain at all three concentrations initially rise at low scattering angles but then plateau out at higher scattering angles. Such behavior is consistent with an extended random coil-like conformation characteristic of protein devoid of a globular structure.
In the cytoplasm of quiescent cells, Sos1 exists in two functional pools in complex with Grb2 and Abi1 signaling adaptors—this association is mediated via the binding of the proline-rich (PR) domain of
Sos1 to SH3 domains within Grb2 and Abi1.
SAXS was used to determine the average structure of the GRA24DN-p38a complex in solution. The radius of gyration was determined to be 4.85 nm with a Dmax of 16.96 nm and ab initio modeling showing an elongated molecule best described by a disordered protein binding two globular domains.
One of the effector proteins secreted by T. gondii, GRA24, has been shown to interact with the MAP kinase p38a, promoting its activation and nuclear translocation.
In both AFM and EM data no secondary structure can be observed in GRA24 confirming its disordered nature.
Since the B-insert is likely unstructured, it is not expected to result in a defined electron density in the EM reconstruction. We oriented the B-insert towards the observed gap between protein and liposome surface in the electron density.
The B-insert contains most of the reported post-translational modifications.
Figure 3A: 6 sumoilation and 2 phosphorilation sites are marked.

When expressed in DNM1L-depleted COS-7 cells, both the 4A and ΔB mutants failed to localize to mitochondria (Figure 3D). Neither mutant was able to revert the aberrant mitochondrial morphology of DNM1L-depleted cells. Both the GPRP motif and the B-insert in DNM1L are required for mitochondrial fission.
When expressed in DNM1L-depleted COS-7 cells, both the 4A and ΔB mutants failed to localize to mitochondria. Instead, the 4A mutant was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm, whereas the ΔB mutant was found in large punctate structures in the cytoplasm.  Both the GPRP motif and the B-insert in DNM1L are required for mitochondrial fission.
The CD spectrum of the unfused wild-type P domain is typical of a denatured protein (Fig. 5A), and we observe no cooperative thermal unfolding transition from 4 to 80°C.

Because the Pab1ΔP lacks an LCR yet retains the ability to phase-separate, we examined its assembly morphology by microscopy. Pab1ΔP assemblies largely retained the droplet-cluster morphology of full-length Pab1 quinary assemblies (Fig. 3G, H). Together, these results point to an electrostatically driven phase-separation dependent on molecular determinants in the RRM regions, which is enhanced, but not solely caused, by the P domain.
Pab1 shows diffuse localization under favorable growth conditions (near 30°C), and localizes to stress granules—large cytosolic foci—within minutes of a shift to 46°C (Fig. 1A). At 42°C, Pab1 is not recruited to stress granules detectable by standard fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1A, (Cherkasov et al., 2013; Wallace et al., 2015)).
After a more severe shock at 46°C, a greater proportion of Pab1 is recruited into small and large sedimentable assemblies (Fig. 1) coincident with stress-granule formation.
We found that 15μM Pab1 (physiological ~20 μM, see Methods) was soluble at 30°C, but demixed to form large particles after a 46°C, 30-minute treatment (Fig. 2A,B).
In the model, both F1L N termini protrude away from the Bcl-2 fold in an extended configuration spanning residues 1–50 in addition to the N-terminal hexahistidine tag (Fig. 2). The shape of both F1L N termini in the model suggests an absence of ordered secondary structure, thus rendering F1L residues 1–50 unfolded.
 However, among the low-energy ensemble, residues 503–610 were found to be extremely flexible without cryo-EM density constraints and therefore were omitted for further coordinate refinement. 
To enable fragment-based, density-guided model refinement with missing
residues (503–610, DRP1), Rosetta iterative local rebuilding tool was customized
to disallow backbone rebuilding at breaks within a single chain. 
The PDB evidence shows this region lacks electron density, indicating it is disordered.
The murine SYD1A N-terminal domain was resistant to thermal denaturation. Thus, mSYD1A contains an intrinsically disordered domain (IDD) at the N terminus.
Deletion of the intrinsically disordered domain (IDD) and C2 domain resulted in a doubling of mSYD1A GAP activity. The IDD alone as well as the IDD-C2 domain supplied in cis where able to repress activity of the isolated mSYD1A GAP domain. Thus, the mSYD1A GAP activity is regulated through protein-protein interactions with the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain.
The N-terminal intrinsically disordered domain of mSYD1A is a critical functional module that binds at least three different ligands: the mSYD1A GAP domain, nsec1/munc18-1, and liprin-α2.
Pepsin digestion of PR-A (∼750 aa) and PR-B (∼930 aa) liganded with hormone agonist ligand R5020 under HDX compatible conditions resulted in 75% and 78% sequence coverage, respectively. Whereas sequence coverage of the LBD was nearly complete, that of the heavily posttranscriptionally modified AF1/NTD was significantly less (59% PR-A; 69% PR-B).
As expected, the ID AF1/NTD and hinge domains of the receptors afforded little protection to hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange. Representative deuterium build-up plots for peptides from AF1/NTD show that, at the earliest time point measured (10 s), their backbone amide hydrogens are near fully exchanged with solvent.
In a recent report, we demonstrated a subregion of PR AF1/NTD (aas 350–428) is required for binding the C-terminal domain of the transcription factor TBP (TBPc) and TBPc-dependent PR transcriptional activation.
The predicted three-dimensional structure of DBD-CTE641 in solution is similar to the crystal structure of PR DBD-CTE641 bound to DNA, except for an altered position of the CTE (residues 632-656). These data implicate the CTE as a flexible region that is capable of adopting a different conformation when bound to a partner macromolecule.
The CTE can participate in DNA binding. A crystal structure of the PR DBD-CTE·DNA complex revealed that the CTE forms an extended loop that interacts with the minor groove flanking either side of the PRE. Mutational analysis confirmed the importance of minor groove-interacting residues in the CTE for high affinity binding to PRE DNA.
The CTE of steroid receptors also binds the chromatin high mobility group proteins-1 and 2 (HMGB-1/-2). Specific residues in a subregion of the CTE were defined as most critical for JDP2 binding and for co-activation of PR.
CD analysis demonstrated that the PR-A NTD (residues 165-545) is largely unstructured under native conditions. The CD spectrum exhibited little or no negative ellipticity at 222 nm and has a large negative maximum below 210 nm that is typical of protein without a stable α-helix and random coil conformation.
The experimental CD spectrum of the mixture of PR-A NTD and TBP(C) was significantly different from the theoretical sum of the spectra of the two proteins. An increased negative absorbance peak at 222 nm and a reduction of negative absorbance peaks at wavelengths below 210 nm were observed with the protein mixture indicative of more α-helix secondary structure and less random coil.
TATA box-binding protein (TBP) binding  with isolated PR domains was only detected with the NTD by SPR.
In contrast, the NTD exhibited much more rapid HDX kinetics with some regions undergoing >90% (red in heat map) exchange. The NTD and hinge exhibit the highest rate of hydrogen-deuterium exchange, whereas structurally stable helices in the LBD and DBD exhibit dramatically less exchange. These results demonstrate the highly dynamic unstructured properties of the NTD in the context of the intact receptor.
The PR NTD was highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation resulting in nearly complete degradation with little or no intact NTD remaining.
When PR NTD and TBP_C were mixed together, protected PR NTD fragments were detected, and the patterns were distinct with each mAb indicating that multiple sites within the NTD change their accessibility to trypsin in the presence of TBP_C. Thus the NTD folds into a more compact conformation when complexed with TBP_C.
The AnDBD (165-688) fragment of PR absorbs with a small negative peak at 222 nm but exhibits much more absorbance below 210 nm. A similar spectrum was obtained with the single-domain AN polypeptide (165-535), indicating that both PR polypeptides contain a large amount of random coil with some underlying helical content.
These data indicate that JDP-2 altered conformation over a fairly broad region containing the DBD and the N-terminal domain out to aa 402. A combination of data from biophysical, partial proteolysis, and functional mutagenesis experiments supports the conclusion that JDP-2 induces a more ordered structure of the N-terminal domain required for transcriptional activity mediated by this region of receptor.

Interestingly, it appears that the C-terminal ∼18 residues (residues: 735–752) are relatively unstructured and poorly defined, having distinct conformations in different structures. This observation is in good agreement with the small chemical shift deviations and lack of the interresidual NOE connectivites over the region
The chemical shift dispersion of the backbone amides is about 1 part per million (ppm), which is compatible with the intrinsically disordered conformation of the N terminus in aqueous solution.
These data suggest that the N terminus of SLP-65 is capable of directly binding to general components of cellular membranes. NMR spectroscopy also confirmed that the N terminus associated directly with liposomes.

Outside the core of H2A, by contrast, the N-terminal αN helix and the C-terminal β3 strand and 310 helix of H2A observed in the nucleosome are entirely disordered in the isolated H2A-H2B dimer, resulting in long disordered tails of about 30 amino acids at both N- and C-termini.
Figure 1, Unstructured residues are indicated in lower case.

The far-UV CD spectrum of A2A-ctL (residues 293-412) is typical for a protein without a globular conformation or secondary structure. It has a small negative shoulder around 222 nm, a strong negative minimum around 200 nm, and no positive signals in the far-UV range.
A2A-ct has a single tryptophan residue at position 346. According to fluorescence measurements, Trp-346 is exposed to an aqueous environment.
The two-dimensional 1H, 15N-HSQC spectrum of A2A-ctL shows poorly dispersed crosspeaks, with the proton chemical shifts ranging from 7.5 to 8.5 1H ppm, indicating that A2A-ct undergoes fast conformational dynamics in solution, which is typical for disordered proteins. According to chemical shifts, the A2A-ctL N-terminal transiently populates β-structures, whereas the remainder is partially α-helical.
A2A-ctL alone was highly elongated. For a fully random polymer chain, the Rg and Dmax values can be estimated from amino acid chain length; for A2A-ctL (134 residues), these values would be 3.78 nm and 10.5 nm, respectively. These results suggest A2A-ctL behaves more or less like a random chain in solution, and is even slightly more elongated than expected for a random polymer, suggesting intramolecular repulsion.
We determined Stokes radii for the peaks corresponding to A2A-ctL, CaM, and A2A-ctL-CaM samples by gel filtration, using proteins with known Stokes radii as standards. In the presence of calcium, the calculated Stokes radii for A2A-ctL, CaM, and the A2A-ctL-CaM complex were 2.74, 2.49, and 3.48 nm, respectively. The relatively high Stokes radii values were understandable because of the disordered nature of A2A-ct.
H(N), N, C(α), C(β) and C' assignments of the intrinsically disordered C-terminus of human adenosine A2A receptor
We have previously structurally characterized this C-terminal domain and its interaction with calmodulin. It was shown to be structurally disordered and flexible, and to bind calmodulin with high affinity in a calcium-dependent manner. Interaction with calmodulin takes place at the N-terminal end of the A2A C-terminal domain without major conformational changes in the latter. NMR was one of the biophysical methods used in the study. Here we present the H(N), N, C(α), C(β) and C' chemical shift assignments of the free form of the C-terminus residues 293-412, used in the NMR spectroscopic characterization of the domain.
For the assignment we employed a combination of common 3D HN-detected assignment spectra and 3D HN-detected experiments specially tailored for intrinsically disordered proteins (Mäntylahti et al. 2009; Hellman et al. 2014). Fast conformational averaging and chemical exchange and absence of structure-induced secondary chemical shifts result in a narrow HN chemical shift range as well as overlap of Cα and Cβ shifts, both commonly observed for IDPs.
To confirm the CaM-binding site on A2A-ctL and the importance of arginine residues for binding, we carried out binding competition experiments using a peptide corresponding to WT A2AR amino acids 291–311 and a peptide corresponding to A2AR amino acids 288–311, with six arginine to alanine mutations (Fig. 4, B and C, respectively). The WT peptide bound calmodulin as expected, because an extra protein band appeared on a native gel. This band was missing from the mutated peptide-CaM sample, demonstrating the importance of the mutated arginine residues for the interaction. When the amount of WT A2A peptide was increased from 3.7 pmol to 24.3 nmol, the peptide clearly displaced A2A-ctL from CaM. On the other hand, the mutated A2A peptide did not affect A2A-ctL-CaM binding, although some unbound CaM was present in samples containing the highest amount of the mutated peptide.
As previous studies have not provided information about stoichiometry and affinity of the A2AR-calmodulin interaction, we performed ITC experiments for CaM binding to A2A-ctL in the presence of calcium and EDTA (Fig. 5, A and B). The A2A-ctL-CaM interaction is a calcium-dependent exothermic binding reaction with a favorable enthalpy (−12.93 ± 0.13 kcal mol−1), but an unfavorable entropy (3.4 kcal mol−1). The dissociation constant (Kd) for the complex is 97.9 ± 9.3 nM and the stoichiometry 0.92 ± 0.04, indicating 1:1 complex formation (Table 1). In the presence of EDTA, no binding was observed. To confirm the CaM-binding site on A2A-ctL, we also titrated A2A-ctS with CaM in the presence of calcium (Fig. 5 C). In this case, much smaller exothermic peaks were observed. Consequently, the removal of amino acids 293–320 from A2A-ct clearly abolished high-affinity binding to CaM.
The C-terminal construct of the A2AR—the full-length domain (A2A-ctL) corresponds to region 293–412, while the null-binding domain (A2A-ctS) corresponds to region 321-412.
Most significant chemical shift perturbations, in terms of disappearance of crosspeaks of the free A2A-ctL form upon addition of CaM, were observed in the proposed CaM binding region in the very N-terminal part of A2A-ctL (Fig. 3 B). This suggests that the CaM binding epitope of A2A-ctL comprises residues 293–321
The C-terminal construct of the A2AR—the full-length domain (A2A-ctL) corresponds to region 293–412, while the null-binding domain (A2A-ctS) corresponds to region 321-412.
Because A2A-ctL seemed to interact with negatively charged lipids, we studied the effect of CaM on the ability of A2A-ctL to bind lipid membranes. For this purpose, we immobilized a mixture of DMPC/DMPG on an L1 SPR sensor chip, and injected A2A-ctL over the lipid surface. A2A-ctL bound immediately to the lipids in a concentration-dependent manner, and no dissociation was observed (Fig. 6).
Although A2A-ctL bound to CaM, no extra bands were detected in either of the samples containing A2A-ctS and CaM. This suggests that the CaM-binding site on A2A-ct locates between amino acids 293 and 320. This region on A2A-ct contains many positively charged arginine residues that are thought to be involved in CaM binding (19). The observed calcium dependence of the binding was surprising, because in previous studies, calcium was not thought to be involved in the interaction (42).
Homo-oligomerization of the human adenosine A 2A receptor is driven by the intrinsically disordered C-terminus
Herein, we focus on the human adenosine A 2A receptor (A 2A R), a model GPCR that forms oligomers both in vitro and in vivo. Combining experimental and computational approaches, we discover that the intrinsically disordered C-terminus of A 2A R drives receptor homo-oligomerization. The formation of A 2A R oligomers declines progressively with the shortening of the C-terminus. Multiple interaction types are responsible for A 2A R oligomerization, including disulfide linkages, hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions. These interactions are enhanced by depletion interactions, giving rise to a tunable network of bonds that allow A 2A R oligomers to adopt multiple interfaces. This study uncovers the disordered C-terminus as a prominent driving factor for the oligomerization of a GPCR, offering important insight into the effect of C-terminus modification on receptor oligomerization of A 2A R and other GPCRs reconstituted in vitro for biophysical studies.
Using the SEC analysis described earlier (Figure 1), we evaluated the HMW oligomer and dimer levels of the A 2A R-DC variants relative to that of the A 2A R full-length-wild-type (FL-WT) control. Both the dimer and the total oligomer levels of A 2A R decreased progressively with the shortening of the C-terminus, with almost no oligomerization detected upon complete truncation of the C-terminus at site A316 (Figure 3B). This result shows that the C-terminus drives A 2A R oligomerization, with multiple potential interaction sites positioned along much of its length.
Since segment 354–359 contains three consecutive charged residues ( 355 ERR 357 ; Figure 3A), which could be involved in electrostatic interactions, we hypothesized that this 355 ERR 357 cluster could strengthen inter-protomer A 2A R-A 2A R association. To test this hypothesis, residues 355 ERR 357 were substituted by 355 AAA 357 on A 2A R-FL-WT and A 2A R-N359DC to generate A 2A R-ERR:AAA variants (Figure 3C). We then compared the HMW oligomer and dimer levels of the resulting variants with controls (same A 2A R variants but without the ERR:AAA mutations). We found that the ERR:AAA mutations had varied effects on the dimer level: decreasing for A 2A R-FL-WT (ctrl: 0.49; ERR:AAA:0.29) but increasing for A 2A R-N359DC (ctrl: 0.33; ERR:AAA: 0.48) (Figure 3C). In contrast, the ERR:AAA mutations reduced the HMW oligomer level of both A 2A R-FL-WT (ctrl: 0.88; ERR:AAA: 0.66) and A 2A R-N359DC (ctrl: 0.68; ERR:AAA: 0.38) (Figure 3C). Consistently, the ERR:AAA mutation lowered the total oligomer level of both A 2A R-FL-WT (ctrl: 1.37; ERR:AAA: 0.94) and A 2A R-N359DC (ctrl:1.01; ERR:AAA: 0.85) (Figure 3C). These results suggest that the charged residues 355 ERR 357 participate in A 2A R oligomerization, with a greater effect in the context of a longer C-terminus and for forming higher-order oligomers. The question then arises as to what types of interactions are formed along the C-terminus that help stabilize A 2A R oligomerization.
Upon closer examination, we recognize that at the very high ionic strength of 0.95 M the increase in the dimer and total oligomer levels was robust for A 2A R-FL-WT, but less pronounced for A 2A R-FL-ERR:AAA (Figure 5). Furthermore, this high ionic strength even had an opposite effect on A 2A R-N359DC, with both its dimer and total oligomer levels abolished (Figure 5). These results indicate that the charged cluster 355 ERR 357 and the C-terminal segment after residue N359 promote the depletion interactions to drive A 2A R oligomerization. Taken together, we can conclude that A 2A R oligomerization is more robust when the C-terminus is fully present and the ionic strength higher, suggesting that depletion interactions via the C-terminus are strong driving factors of A 2A R oligomerization.
In particular, the 355 ERR 357 cluster of charged residues lies distal from the dimeric interface but still forms several salt bridges (Figure 7A, inset). This observation is supported by our experimental results showing that substituting this charged cluster with alanines reduces the total A 2A R oligomer levels (Figure 3C).

A 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectrum recorded at a pH of 6.8 and temperature of 298 K of an 15N-labeled glycine-rich (HvGR) protein sample reveals that the glycine-rich domain of HvGR-RBP1 is unstructured in solution, displaying only broad resonances in the central “random coil” region of the spectrum.
Spectral changes taking place upon addition of unlabeled N-HvGR-RBP1 to 15N-HvGR suggest that the two protein domains can interact in vitro in trans, although the biological significance of these interactions is unclear.
Nucleic acid interaction assays indicated that the GR domain of HvGR-RBP1 can bind to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) in the absence of the RRM domain.

Also see supplements. In both apo-S100A5 and Ca2-S100A5, the relaxation
rate measurements show large mobility on a time scale
shorter than the reorientation time (R1 increases, R2
decreases, the NOE decreases) in the hinge loop and for the
last residues at the C-terminus, thus indicating that such
regions may be largely unstructured.
The significant amount of peak doubling suggests that the non-glycine residues in the GR experience different chemical environments in relatively stable different conformations of the GR. The lack of 1H chemical shift dispersion for the GR resonances indicates a lack of structure. The peak doubling, broadened GR peaks and the perturbations of RRM resonances suggest that the GR may transiently interacts with the RRM.
Together, these observations strongly suggest that the GR of the full-length protein can associate specifically to the RRM domain in an intermolecular fashion.
In the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of uniformly 15N-labeled AID (res. 422-525) the majority of backbone amide proton resonances exhibited poor chemical shift dispersion (∼7.8-8.6 ppm), indicating substantial regions of structural disorder. In addition, the majority of resonances were either broadened or missing, indicating interconversion between multiple conformations within the “intermediate” spectroscopic timescale.
The best characterized function of the C-terminal AID is inhibition of upstream kinase-mediated HM (T412) and T-loop (T252) phosphorylation events, required for S6K1 activation. Trans-addition of purified recombinant ‘disordered’ AID does indeed effectively inhibit S6K1 phosphorylation by PDK1.
Multi-site Ser-Thr phosphorylation of AID (S434, S441, T444, and S447 in S6K1) destabilizes its autoinhibitory interaction with the kinase domain of S6K1.
AID displayed anomalously slower mobility in SDS-PAGE (apparent molecular mass of 15 kDa), that is 1.25-fold higher than the molecular mass of 11,988 Da calculated from its amino acid sequence.
AID displayed anomalously faster mobility in Superdex™ 75 size exclusion chromatography (apparent molecular mass of 15 kDa), 1.25-fold higher than the molecular mass of 11,988 Da calculated from its amino acid sequence.
CD spectra of AJ18–KRAB(Ab) showed that ity contains mostly random coil (56% ∼ 65%) with a small degree of helix (35% ∼ 39%) but little β sheet (0 ∼ 5%). These data suggest that the KRAB domain alone may not be highly structured.
The HSQC spectra of His-AJ18 KRAB(Ab) shows that the majority of backbone amide resonances exhibit poor dispersion, indicating substantial regions of disordered structure, consistent with CD results. NOESY of the sample exhibited minimal NOE cross-peaks providing further evidence of lack of a well defined 3D conformation. The 1D 1H spectra further confirm the lack of structure for the KRAB fragment.
The loss of signals is consistent with KRAB(Ab) binding to the much larger KAP-1–RBCC protein. Given that the KRAB(Ab):KAP-1–RBCC complex is 1:3 molar ratio, the complex is a 180 kDa species. Here molecular tumbling is slow therefore the NMR signals are too broad to be readily detected. Therefore, the loss of observable peaks in the complex versus in the free spectra indicates that KRAB(Ab) was binding to KAP-1–RBCC.
The results of the proteolysis of the KRAB:KAP-1 complex, suggest that KRAB is well folded upon binding KAP-1. In addition, the spectrum of KRAB in complex with KAP-1–RBCC exhibits no heterogeneity, which would be expected if some chemical exchange processes were present.
the proteolysis of the free KRAB constructs, clearly indicates that any such structure is transient as it does not lead to protection from proteases.
The HSQC spectra of ZNF274-KRAB(AB) shows that the majority of backbone amide resonances exhibit poor dispersion, indicating substantial regions of disordered structure. Most backbone resonances fall (> 95%) within the center of the spectrum (7.7 ppm to 8.5 ppm), some are broadened or missing indicating intermediate timescale motions. Minimal NOE cross-peaks and the 1D 1H spectra confirm the lack of structure.
Transcriptional repression by the KRAB domains correlates with its binding to KAP-1 (KRAB associated protein 1), also referred to as TIF1β or KRIP-1. The KRAB domain binds directly with high affinity to the RBCC domain of KAP-1.
Consistent with these studies, the proteolysis of the free KRAB constructs, clearly indicates that any such structure is transient as it does not lead to protection from proteases.
CD spectra of the ZNF274–KRAB(AB)-SCAN protein construct showed that it contains mostly random coil (56% ∼ 65%) with a small degree of helix (35% ∼ 39%) but little β sheet (0 ∼ 5%). These data suggest that the KRAB domain alone may not be highly structured.
The far-UV CD spectra of the 7B2  did not support the presence of secondary structures such as α helices or β strands. The characteristic negative peaks at 208 and 222 nm displayed by α helical proteins were not visible in 7B2 spectra. The α helical content was estimated as 29% for 27 kDa 7B2, while the β sheet content was 14%.
The 1H–15N HSQC spectrum displayed considerably smaller number of peaks than would be expected from a well-folded 186-residue protein. The chemical shift dispersion was extremely narrow, between 6.9 and 8.4 ppm, indicative of unfolded protein. This conclusion was strengthened by the natural abundance 13C–1H HSQC spectrum, where we observed far fewer peaks and poor chemical shift dispersion.
7B2 is a small secretory protein that is known to be required for the productive maturation of the subtilisin-like endoprotease prohormone convertase 2 (proPC2). The motifs and domains required for the interaction between 7B2 and proPC2 are established.
The far-UV CD spectra of the 7B2 protein samples did not support the presence of typical secondary structures elements. The characteristic negative peaks at 208 and 222 nm displayed by α helical proteins were not visible in 7B2 spectra. Estimation of secondary structure content revealed that the 27 kDa C. elegans protein contained few structural elements, only 18% α helix and 26% β sheet content.
Despite the low level of overall sequence conservation, the physiological functions of the C. elegans protein with regard to help the maturation of prohormone convertase 2 (proPC2) within the secretory pathway appear to be similar to those of the vertebrate proteins.
Sml1 is highly flexible in solution with no defined tertiary structure. Three regions exhibited a high degree of backbone order (S2 > 0.6); residues 4 to 14, 20 to 35, and 61 to 80. Regions 4-14 and 61-80 are alpha-helical, as shown by the positive secondary Cα chemical shifts. Overall, Sml1 is best characterized as a loosely folded protein in which the two main helices are oriented in an antiparallel fashion.
The small spectral width of the amide signals of Sml1 clearly indicates that the protein is mainly unfolded. Secondary chemical shifts analysis suggests the presence of two helical regions in Sml1. SSP-analysis shows that the helix propensity in region 60-80 is very high. Interestingly, the region 33-45 has β-sheet propensity. The NOE values are all above 0 and the pattern is similar as for the relaxation rates.
The section Asp55–Ser68 of the N-terminal extension, which was partly disordered in the RNA complex, folded into an -helix that occupied the central cleft between the two lobes.
The Asp55–Ser68 -helix makes a significant number of side chain interactions with both conserved domains.
The interactions of the cleft-inserted helix with the conserved domains and with the nucleotide attest to the specificity and selectivity of the positioning of the N-terminal extension and point to a potential regulatory mechanism for the intrinsic ATPase activity of DDX19.
MR-AF1a was also sensitive to rapid limited trypsin digestion.
The tryptophan in MR-AF1a (residues 1-169) is essentially solvent exposed with a λmax of 351 nm, i.e. not significantly changed by urea-induced unfolding.
The spectrum in buffer shows a strong minimum at around 197 nm, which is indicative of nonordered structure. In the presence of increasing amounts of TFE, there is increasing negative ellipticity at 209 and at 222 nm, which is associated with an increase in α-helical content at the expense of both β-structure and nonordered structure.
The far-UV spectra for MR-MD (residues 247-385) showed a similar trend to MR-AF1a (having a strong minimum at around 197 nm) with a more helical conformation adopted in the presence of TFE.
The conformation of the MR-MD polypeptide was investigated by limited proteolysis. The MR-MD polypeptide is digested in a time-dependent manner, and this digestion is prevented in the presence of TMAO. This is consistent with induced folding of the MD and adoption of a more protease-resistant conformation.
Residues in the N- and C-termini and several loops (residues 1–5, 55–86, 341–353 and 375–380 of NF90 and 362–390 of
NF45) could not be modeled due to poor electron density in these regions that made a clear interpretation of the map difficult.
Residues in the N- and C-termini and several loops (residues 1–5, 55–86, 341–353 and 375–380 of NF90 and 362–390 of
NF45) could not be modeled due to poor electron density in these regions that made a clear interpretation of the map difficult.
The linker region connecting the two domains (residues 468–518) is not visible, consistent with the prediction that this region is natively disordered.
The solved structure clearly shows the segment 29-44 in NF45 does not assume a secondary structure and buries in an extended form into the dimerization interface between NF90 . and NF45. In addition,  according to the authors,  NF45 is unable to homodimerize because the extension sequences would cause steric clashes, suggesting this segment would remain extended and disordered when monomeric.
Diffracting crystals were obtained with complexes of NF90 (1–380)  and NF45 (29–390). Residues 362 to 390 in NF45 could not be modeled due to poor electron density, as expected for disordered regions. The solved structure reveals residues 347 to 361 do not fold into a secondary structure packing in an extended form at the dimerization interface of NF90 and NF45, suggesting to be part of this disordered segment.
Structural studies were carried out with mouse NF90 and NF45. Mouse and human NF90 show 95% sequence identity while mouse and human NF45 are identical at the protein level.
Residues in the N- and C-termini and several loops (residues 1–5, 55–86, 341–353 and 375–380 of NF90 and 362–390 of NF45) could not be modelled due to poor electron density in these regions that made a clear interpretation of the map difficult.
Due to their unusual amino acid composition, IDPs bind less SDS molecules and move more slowly in gel than globular proteins. aaUsp-NTD (residues 1-112) exhibits such properties. The apparent molecular mass of aaUsp-NTD calculated on the basis of SDS-PAGE electrophoretical mobility was 14 kDa, whereas the theoretical molecular mass was 12.718 kDa.
The spectrum exhibits features of spectra typical of IDPs, because it has a deep minimum at 200 nm, which is characteristic for a random coil and it has a slight negative band at 222 nm, which is typical for ordered secondary structures. CD spectra in the presence of varying concentrations of GdmCl also imply that aaUsp-NTD is a highly unfolded protein with a residual secondary structure.
aaUsp-NTD's theoretical molecular mass is 12.718 kDa. The Ve of purified aaUsp-NTD corresponds to a pro-
tein with an apparent molecular mass equal to 24.7 kDa and RS equal to 22.7 Å (1 Å = 0.1 nm). This indicates 
that aaUsp-NTD may have an expanded conformation such as IDPs do.
Analysis of the data obtained suggests that aaUsp-NTD eluted as a monomer (eluted as a distinct, symmetric peak corresponding to a monomer and the Ve value was independent of the sample concentration). Additionally, the frictional ratio was fitted to 1.8, indicating that aaUsp-NTD is an asymmetric protein with an RS of 28.1 Å.
The results showed that the highest rate of exchange, approximately 80%, was observed for the peptides covering the NTD (residues 1-58), which is consistent with the results of the bioinformatic analyses, indicating that this region is disordered.
EcRA-NTD spectra is reminiscent of spectra typical of proteins containing numerous disordered regions, because it displays a deep minimum around 200 nm. However, EcRA-NTD is not fully random coil-like, as it has a content of the residual secondary structure, which can be destroyed by GdmCl denaturation.
Stokes radius determined on the basis of gel filtration was substantially bigger, 36.6 +/-1.5 A for EcRA-NTD than the theoretical Stokes radius.
The protein was extensively degraded, however the peptide bonds were not accessible at random. There are nineteen potential trypsin cleavage sites within the EcRA-NTD sequence, yet only nine main proteolysis products were revealed through electrophoretic gels.
The low chemical shift dispersion in the HSQC spectrum is consistent with an unfolded domain. The measured chemical shifts of HN, NH, Cα, Cβ, and C′ have been compared with random-coil values corrected for local sequence effects. The observed deviations are small, as expected for an unfolded protein. N–HN RDCs measured for USrc are predominantly negative as for unfolded proteins.
The phosphorylation of c-SRC Ser17 by PKA (cAMP-dependent protein kinase) is a well-characterized process.
The switch I loop of EF-Tuputida (residues 40–62) is disordered.
Is possible that the N-terminus (A1-L11) becomes structured in the presence of the LH1 R subunit and RC components (...). In addition, the lack of charged amino acids (L6-L11) suggests the N-terminus should be buried, and this may also occur in the presence of the LH1 R subunit and the RC.
The long T1 and T2 values for the N-terminus are typical of disordered polypeptides.
Four regions of disorder are present in the Pf12short structure, all localized to surface loops projecting away from the core domain (dotted lines in Fig. 3A and 4A). In D1, a 33-residue region between Glu-83 and Ile-117 connecting β4 and β6 could not be modeled
a 15-residue loop between Lys-142 (β7) and Asp-158 (β8) was disordered
We crystallized Ndc80ΔN-bonsai and determined its crystal structure to 2.9 Å resolution with phases from a single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) experiment (Table 1 and Experimental Procedures). So far, we have been unable to crystallize Ndc80bonsai, possibly because the N-terminal tail of Ndc80 (residues 1–79) is disordered.
Our results indicate that the N-terminal region of Ndc80 contributes to microtubule binding.
Ndc80bonsai detached from microtubules in the presence of active Aurora B kinase and ATP. Using mass spectrometry, we determined that Aurora B phosphorylates Ndc80 at Ser5, Ser8, Ser15, Ser44, Ser55, Ser62, and Ser69. Our sites confirm and extend the list of in vitro (Ser5, Ser15, Thr49, Ser55, and Ser69) or in vivo (Ser55 and Ser62) Aurora B sites identified previously.
The Ndc80 CH domain and helical hairpin are connected through a disordered segment (residues 202–215).
Chemical shift analysis (Cα, Cβ) showed no stable secondary structure elements in unmodified or phosphorylated Elk-1 TAD
Phosphorylation of the transcriptional activation domain (TAD) of Elk-1 by the protein kinase ERK at multiple sites potentiates recruitment of the Mediator transcriptional coactivator complex and transcriptional activation, but the roles of individual phosphorylation events had remained unclear.
The fully and partially phosphorylated state (Thr337, Thr354, Thr364, Thr369,  Ser390, Thr418, and Ser423) of the regions is also disordered.

We quantified the conformational properties of Ash1420–500 using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and all atom simulations. These studies reveal that unphosphorylated Ash1 420–500 adopts expanded coil-like conformations in aqueous solutions.

HX MS of unbound Lck SH3 shows that Lck SH3 undergoes local unfolding with a half-life of ;10 sec. This unfolding rate is in stark contrast to that observed for Hck SH3 (;17 min). Regions that undergo local unfolding are shown in red (residues 44–61) and blue (residues 16–33).

NMR experiments revealed that the N-terminal part of the unphosphorylated OdhI protein is fully disordered (Met1-Glu40).
pT15 - an important number of intense peaks centered around 8.5 ppm in the 1H dimension of the HSQC recorded on OdhI and attributed to mobile unfolded residues disappeared in the HSQC spectrum recorded on pOdhI. This suggests the structuring of a large part of the N-terminal residues upon phosphorylation. PDB:  2KB3 2KB4
the phosphorylation results in the folding of 26 amino acids from the N-terminal, but only seven of them, centered on pThr15, are in contact with the FHA core domain according to our NMR data.
NMR and circular dichroism (CD) evidence assign different conformational propensities to polyserine peptides from the honeybee and the jewel wasp Nasonia vitripennis; the former is extended and disordered and the latter more compact and helical.
The UV spectra of the peptides show considerable differences, suggesting a random coil for AmVg(358–392).
AmVg (336–385) retains its random values and lack of NOEs indicative of any fixed structure, a result also supported by the CD spectrum

a detailed NMR study on the structural and dynamic properties of the cytoplasmic domain of human ephrin B2. Our results reveal the following: (1) the N-terminal region of the cytoplasmic domain from residues 253 to 300 lacks the ability for structure formation and is particularly prone to aggregation
the C-terminal functional subdomain from residues 301 to 333 assumes two distinctive structural elements with residues 301-322 adopting a well-packed hairpin structure followed by a flexible C-terminal tail.
the unphosphorylated 22-residue motif adopts a well formed beta-hairpin structure in isolation from the ephrinB cytoplasmic subdomain. However, this beta-hairpin is radically abolished by tyrosine phosphorylation, regardless of the relative location and number of Tyr residues.
the present study reveals that, as shown by circular dichroism and NMR, the unphosphorylated 22-residue motif adopts a well formed beta-hairpin structure in isolation from the ephrinB cytoplasmic subdomain. However, this beta-hairpin is radically abolished by tyrosine phosphorylation, regardless of the relative location and number of Tyr residues.
However, this beta-hairpin is radically abolished by tyrosine phosphorylation, regardless of the relative location and number of Tyr residues.
The extreme N-terminal (residues 1 to 18) and C-terminal (residues 150 to 162) regions were not defined and have been omitted for clarity.
Rather than acting to tether a disordered N-terminal region, phosphorylation of Thr22 appears to stabilize a preexisting but low-occupancy association of residues 21 to 30 with the FHA domain. Amino acid residues 21 to 33 adopted an extended conformation that encompassed a short region with helical propensity
We therefore propose that, rather than acting to tether a disordered N-terminal region, phosphorylation of Thr22 appears to sta- bilize a preexisting but low-occupancy association of residues 21 to 30 with the FHA domain.
hese data suggest a mechanism for the regulation of intermolecular interactions of Rv1827 through intramolecular binding of its N-terminal region to the FHA domain after phosphorylation at either Thr21 or Thr22 by PknG or PknB

igh-sensitivity SOFAST 15N-1H HMQC spectra28 were recorded on samples from the two HPLC peaks (Fig. 4a): the two spectra clearly show that the nonphosphorylated protein is folded, whereas the phosphorylated protein is essentially unfolded.

Our data indicate that phosphorylation of KH1 unfolds the domain and creates a site for 14-3-3ζ binding.
Fig 1 shows part of the final 1.6-Å-resolution 2Fo – Fc electron-density map. The electron densities of the N-terminal portion (residues 10–15) and two loop regions (residues 91–107 and 138–140) were not seen in the model because of disorder. 
Loop region 91-107 corresponds to 170-186 region in Uniprot.
The first 20 residues from the amino-terminus (residues 100–120), residues 177–178 (EF2 loop), and residues 192–195 (domain linker) all exhibited weak NMR signals with random coil chemical shifts, indicative of structural disorder in these regions.
The authors could not solve the structure for this region in the Cryo-EM experiment, probably due to poor electron density  expected for a disordered region.

Following strand 1, there is a -hairpin encompassing residues 50–74 with residues 55–71 not visible. Given that there are no unambiguous experimental sequence markers in this region (no Met and no Cys residues), there is some uncertainty of the sequence register in the 50–79 region of Vps25 WHA. The region from 55 to 74 represents an insertion in the yeast Vps25 relative to other species (...).
Vps25 is the most flexible of the three subunits. Flexible internal loops between residues 56–70, 110–115, 146–149 and 162–164, as well as the C-terminal ten residues, could not be visualized in electron density.
It (Vps25) lacks canonical helix 2, which instead folds into a large disordered loop followed by strands 3 and 4 that connects to helix 2 (at the corresponding position of canonical helix 3).
The final model lacks two to five flexible loops (molecule mol A, residues 56–72, 114–115, 156–157; mol B, residues 53–73, 157–158; mol C, residues 57–72, 155– 158; mol D, residues 19–21, 55–73, 107–120, 156–160, 185–186).
This loop (residues 409–425) appears to be very mobile and is unstructured apart from a single helical turn close to the start of β5. In our construct the linker makes no observable contact with the rest of the protein; however, it is positioned above the RNA binding surface and may play a role in RNA recognition.
The loop β4–β5 of PTB RRM-3 is highly disordered in solution, and no interaction was found with the rest of the molecule. Nevertheless, its position with respect to the central β-sheet suggests that it may function as determinant for RNA specificity, perhaps making specific hydrogen bonds with RNA bases that help to clamp the bound RNA in position.
PTB-34 has a tandem domain structure in which the RRMs are tethered by a linker peptide of 25 residues in length. While the conformations of the secondary structural elements within RRMs 3 and 4 are well defined, the inter-domain linker region of PTB-34 was mostly unassigned.
There are no inter-domain contacts whatsoever and the two RRM domains appear to tumble independently, the long linker region making no fixed contacts with the rest of the protein, presumably due to disorder.
A 197-residue C-terminal fragment of human PTB, which contains the third and fourth RNP-CS domains... The NMR assignment of 1HN, 15N, 13Cα, 13Cβ and 13C0 nuclei of PTB-C197 is approximately 95% complete. These data clearly show the presence of two domains connected by a linker region. Three of the largest gaps in the assignment occur within the linker (residues 77–79, 104–107 and 111–114).
Analysis of 1H-15N NOE data (not shown) for PTB-C197 indicates that for some of the residues in the linker and in loop regions for the RNP-CS the polypeptide chain is highly flexible.
Assignments could not be made for the majority of residues within the extensive inter-domain linker sequence (residues 143–184 approximately) and also at the N- and C-termini. 15N-relaxation data confirm that these regions are highly flexible (data not shown) and are likely to be unstructured.
The structure of complex has been solved.
"These results show that STING binds to IRF-3 via its C-terminal pLxIS motif upon phosphorylation.
The pLxIS motif interacts with IRF-3 through electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions."
"The SPR binding study shows that the S366A mutation abolishes IRF-3 binding by pSTING, indicating that phosphorylation of Ser366 is critical for IRF-3 recruitment."
"Electron density for the C-terminal end of the protein, AA344-379, positioned at the end of helix α9 was missing"
"Both the final refined STING CTD model in the apo and c-di-GMP–bound forms contains all the residues of STING CTD except the two segments containing residues 149–150 and 344–379, which have no clear electron density and are presumed to be disordered in solution."
The N-terminal region (that encompasses residues 1 to 22 preceding the helix 1) showed to be disordered in the crystal structure.
The N-terminal region of Vps22 (...) is particularly rich in basic residues (30% inhuman Vps22) (...). Consistent with this, we observe weak but reproducible binding of the N-terminal helical domain of Vps22 (residues 1–90) to brain-derived liposomes (data not shown), suggesting that Vps22 might contribute to membrane binding of ESCRT II.
Vps22 consists of a single N-terminal coiled coil followed by two winged-helix (WH) domains (Supplementary Fig. 1a). All but the first 19 residues are ordered.
The loop connecting the b2 and b3 strands of the Sxl RBD1 (b2/b3 loop) consists of ten amino acid residues (R158 to G167), and is as long as that of the Sxl RBD2 (R244 to G253).
Characteristic of a poorly ordered region, the electron density for the 10-residue interdomain linker was weak and discontinuous in maps calculated with the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data.
Weak electron density and the high B-factors of the interdomain linker imply significant flexibility in this region. The structure of SXL RRM1+2 reveals a complete absence of interdomain contacts.
In summary, SXL RRM1 and RRM2 form two discreet RNA binding surfaces that are too far apart in the crystal structure to interact simultaneously with the high-affinity, r(GU8C) RNA. These results indicate that the interdomain linker acts as flexible tether, and orientation of the RRM domains is coupled to RNA binding.
Figure10 A: The 20 backbone structures of RBD1FY, which were superimposed for minimal root-mean-square deviation of the backbone atoms (N, C alpha, and C') of residues 125 to 131, 137 to 157, and 167 to 201 (stereoview).
The KCNE3 structure is composed of an extracellular N-terminal surface-associated amphipathic helix (residues 10 to 30) connected by a flexible loop to the a-helical transmembrane domain (TMD; 57 to 82), followed by a short juxtamembrane helix (90 to 95) and a disordered C terminus (96 to 103).
A loop and an extended structure were assigned for the fragment encompassing residues 69 to 91, based on poor Cryo-EM electron density.  Missing electron density did not allow the authors to model the structure for residues 92 to 101. These facts suggest the region 69 to 101 is unstructured.
The proteolytic susceptibility of the region connecting the second NZF motif at residue 203 and the start of the C-terminal domain at 396 suggests that a flexible linker connects these two domains.
No density is visible for residues 1–395 of Vps36
it was determined that the crystallized complex contained a fragment of Vps36 comprising residues 396–566

The N-terminal portion of Vps36 contains two copies of a NZF zinc-finger motif. The second NZF finger of Vps36 binds ubiquitin and is thought to be the main site of interaction between ESCRT-II and ubiquitinated cargo proteins
The second NZF finger, also known as Vps36-1, is also widely described in PMID:15029239 as it contains a 13TF14/Φ25 motif and binds Ub (Kd=182 μM), whereas the other NZF domain (Vps36‐2, residues 114-151) lacks this motif and does not bind Ub. Moreover, the Ub‐binding activity of the Vps36 NZF domain is required for efficient sorting of ubiquitylated substrates into the MVB.

We then prepared 15N-labeled kindlin-2 residues 328–367 (termed K2F2N) (Fig. 4B). Fig. 4C shows that kindlin-2 residues 328–367 are largely unstructured.
Specifically bind to unlabeled ILK KLD·α-parvin CH2, with 16 kindlin-2 residues undergoing significant line-broadening and/or chemical shift perturbations including two characteristic glycine peaks.
We assigned 267 NOE cross-peaks and calculated the solution structure of the kindlin-2 residues 339–358 bound to ILK (Fig. 6C and Table 1).
Revealed a short random coil followed by a single amphipathic α-helix consisting of residues from 346 to 358.
The structures are well converged except the N-terminal M1-D15 that appears to be highly flexible with few long range NOEs.
"The N-terminal residues 173–188 were disordered. "
The N-terminal region, corresponding to residues 1–10, adopts an extended and rather flexible structure as indicated by the low 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE values, which correlate with dynamic events in the nanosecond timescale.
The C-terminal residues R141-L151, encompassing the PDZ binding motif (Thomas et al., 2002), adopt a random conformation.
The C-terminal 141-151 residues corresponds to the 148-158 region of the Uniprot entry, since residues are numbered as in the shorter transcript of HPV 16 E6. They use a E6 construct containing four Cys-Ser mutations, but they expect its structure to be identical to the wildtype because the mutated cysteins were not conserved in E6 alignments, the Cys/Ser change is relatively isosteric, the mutations did not prevent the domain from adopting a stable fold, all mutated positions turn out to be exposed on the surface of the calculated structure, and these mutations are also present in the full-length E6 6C/6S mutant displaying in vitro and in vivo p53 degradation properties indistinguishable from those of wild-type E6.

 The N-terminal and C-terminal tails are highly variable in both length and sequence, but the interdomain linker has a fixed length in all HPV species and contains several highly conserved hydrophobic residues presenting the periodicity of a helix (Figure 2A).

For all the PBMs tested, an increase of 4 to 11 °C in the Tm was observed, showing that the PBM binding onto PTPN3-PDZ stabilizes the domain, whether the PBM is of cellular or viral origin.
The PBM region corresponds to the C-terminal 148-158 residues of the Human papillomavirus type 16 E6 protein. 
We obtained KD values of 29 μM, 53 μM and 37 μM for PTPN3-PDZ with HBVc PBM, HPV16E6 PBM and HPV18E6 PBM, respectively (Table 1). The KD values are all in the same tenth-of-micromolar range for the viral PBMs and are close to the one of the cellular partner p38γ. The measured affinities fall in the standard 0.1–100 μM range12 for PDZ-PBM interactions.

The N-terminal region of Tag can be divided in a  J-like domain and an extended loop (L4) containing the LxCxE sequence necessary for the interaction with the B box in Rb. PDB structure shows unstructured loops L1, L2 and L3 which are internal and allow proper folding of J-like domain. L2 contains the conserved HDB sequence that has been proved to be functionally important for interactions and chaperone-like activity

PDB structure shows unstructured loops L1, L2 and L3 which are internal and allow proper folding of J-like domain.

The importance of loop L2 is indicated by the strong conservation of the HPD sequence in all J domains (Tsai and Douglas, 1996). Large T antigen mutants in this region are unable to dissociate E2F from Rb and are, as a consequence, replication defective. Also, DnaJ mutants in this region have lost their chaperone function (Srinivasan et al., 1997).
Comparison between TROSY-HSQC NMR peak dispersion from protein constructs used in this work, the authors suggest that the linker between J-domain and OBD domain is flexible.

The loop containing the LxCxE motifs forms an extended conformation and binds to the shallow surface groove on the B box created by five helices, three of which are from the cyclin box (in Rb).
The authors solved a structure with two molecules of Smac/DIABLO in the crystal as a dimer. In their final model, no electron density was seen for the 14 first residues in the N terminal region in Chain A and for the 12 first residues in Chain B, confirming that this protein region is highly mobile in the absence of interaction with BIR domains partners.

The authors could only trace the N-terminal segment (residues 56 to 59) of the bound peptide in the complex SmacN-Survivin in the crystal structure. Due to missing electron density the C terminal (60-70) could not be solved. The extended interaction and the missing residues suggest this region is disordered in solution in its unbound form.
In the mature form of Smac (1-186), residue 1 corresponds to residue 56 of unprocessed Smac (1- 239). For this mature form, no electron density is seen corresponding to the N-terminal 10 residues suggesting this segment is disordered in solution.
The linker between POUS and POUH domains (residues 182–200) is disordered. Nevertheless, connectivity between domains was established based on crystal packing and distance considerations (Figure 2A). The presence of neighboring molecules in the crystal lattice precludes the alternative configuration.

Our observation of very narrow 1H chemical shift dispersion of merely 0.9 ppm (7.7–8.6 ppm) in the 15N-HSQC spectrum of LANA C-terminal fragment (residues 1110–1162) indicates that this region is unstructured (Figure S1A).
The LANA gene fragment used in this publication was derived from the Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus). IDR is 100% identical and corresponds to 1065-1117 region.
We thus constructed a BRD4 ET domain fused at its N-terminus to LANA comprising residues 1110–1162 via a flexible linker (GSGSGS), and determined by NMR analysis that the minimal ET binding site in LANA is confined to residues 1131–1149 (NLQSSIVKFKKPLPLTQPG) (data not shown). Notably, the 15N-HSQC spectra of the ET domain displayed nearly identical protein backbone resonance perturbation patterns induced by adding a LANA segment consisting of residues 1110–1162 or 1131–1149 (Figure S1A), or a LANA peptide of residues 1133–1144 (Figure 1B, red vs. blue signals), thereby defining the ET domain binding site in LANA to residues 1133–1144. We further determined binding affinity of the ET domain to the LANA peptide by NMR titration to be approximately Kd = 635 μM (Figure S1A).
The LANA gene fragment used in this publication was derived from the Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus). IDR is 100% identical and corresponds to 1086-1104 region.
We next solved the three-dimensional structure of the BRD4 ET domain bound to the LANA peptide (residues 1133–1144) using heteronuclear multidimensional NMR spectroscopy (Clore and Gronenborn, 1994) (Figure 1C and Table 1). The structure reveals that the viral peptide establishes a two-strand inter-molecular antiparallel β-sheet with the protein.
The LANA gene fragment used in this publication was derived from the Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus). IDR is 100% identical and corresponds to 1086-1104 region.
This poly-E region is inferred by the curator to be disordered, based on MobiDB-Lite and according to experimental evidence demonstrating that poly-E repeats display random-coil-like conformation (PMID:16949547)

Residues 1 to 15 and 86 to 114 are disordered as judged by narrower 1H NMR linewidths compared with that of the structured region of the polypeptide, presence of strong HN-H2O crosspeaks in the 15N-separated NOESY spectrum (Marion et al., 1989), and the absence of long range nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) signals.

The atomic models include DNA and most of the residues of RAD51 except for the N-terminal 1-21 residues and a few residues in flexible loop regions.

Overall, the electron density for the protein was well ordered except for two short loop regions (Asp-245 to Gly-248 and Asp-309 to Ser-316 in Subunit I and Asn-247 to Arg-250 and Gly-311 to Ser-316 in Subunit II) and two larger regions that are located on the same side of the molecule (Gly-328 to Glu-362 and Leu-394 to Lys-413 in Subunit I and Gly-328 to Glu-361 and Gly-395 to Lys-413 in Subunit II).

As found in previous studies of retroviral nucleocapsid proteins studied by NMR, there was no evidence of stable, easily identifiable secondary structural regions in the molecule. Comparison of the experimentally determined Ca and Ha chemical shifts with random coil values are largely consistent with this picture, with no systematic deviation toward a-helical or /3-strand values among contiguous residues. 
The zinc was covalently attached to the SY atom of each of the Cys and Ne2 of each His. Zn(l1)-ligand bonds were assigned distances of 2.10 8, (Zn-SY) and 2.00 A (Zn-Ne2) and a force constant of 200 kcal/(mol A2).
Thermal denaturation monitored by the ellipticity at 222 nm (Figure 2B) shows that the protein loses progressively (noncooperative unfolding) its helical structure between 5 °C and 40 °C, suggesting a low degree of tertiary structural organization ( 34).
 The Rg value is 2-fold larger than the value expected for a compact, globular protein with the same number (n) of residues which is Rg ∼ 3n1/3 = 15 Å ( 40). It can also be compared with the expected value for a completely unfolded protein. 
Moreover, in the (15N)NOESY-HSQC spectrum no medium or long-range NOE cross-peaks were observed, suggesting a lack of
persistent secondary or tertiary structure, in agreement with the SAXS results.
Figure 6A shows the thermogram and the binding isotherm corresponding to the titration of HsCen2 (200 μM) into C-XPC (15 μM). Fitting the isotherm to a single-site binding model gives a stoichiometry of 1:1, a binding constant of 2.9 (1) × 108 M-1, and a reaction enthalpy ΔH = −30.2 (0.2) kcal/mol. Therefore, C-XPC binds HsCen2 with high affinity and thermodynamic parameters similar to that of the 17-mer peptide (Table 1).
A quantitative analysis of the far-UV CD spectra of C-XPC domain was made by fitting the experimental data
to an appropriate combination of “pure” secondary structure spectra. Utilization of two different fitting procedures,
CONTIN (32) and CDSSTR (33), gave similar values for the secondary structure content of C-XPC: 33% and 37% alpha-helix, respectively.
The peptide alone exhibits a CD spectrum characteristic for a highly disordered structure, as is generally the case for linear polypeptides of this size.
Therefore, the large variation of the negative band intensity at 222 nm, the most characteristic for the α structure, suggests that a fragment of the peptide undergoes a random coil-to-helix structural transition upon binding to the protein, bringing a significant contribution to the α-helix CD band.
Adding of P1-XPC, at a 1:1 molar ratio, to SC-HsCen2/Ca2+ induces a considerable enhancement of the CD signal (by ∼50%) with a rough conservation of the relative intensities of different bands (Fig. 5A). 
For the N-terminal stretch (Ser12 to Lys29), only intra-residual and sequential NOEs could be detected. This type of NOE signature is typical of unstructured polypeptide chains.
Limited proteolysis of the insect-cellexpressed 754-residue Rad4 showed that the 100 N-terminal (residues 1–100) and 122 C-terminal (633–754) residues are highly susceptible to digestion, suggesting that they are unstructured or loosely folded.

The L1, L2, and L3 regions of Rad23, consisting of amino acids 77-147, 185-265, and 311-355, respectively, were attached to the C terminus of Rad23. Rad23-L3 was degraded efficiently but Rad23-L1 and Rad23-L2 were degraded more slowly.
These four domains have well-defined structures but are connected by flexible linker regions ranging in length from 45 to 82 amino acids.

These four domains have well-defined structures but are connected by flexible linker regions ranging in length from 45 to 82 amino acids.
The refined model (Rad4-Rad23) contains residues 255–309 and 347–395 of Rad23, and 250 water molecules. The final models of the ternary complexes (Rad4-Rad23-DNA) contain residues 256–369 of Rad23.
Rad23 binds to the Rad4 TGD, at a site away from the DNA-binding surface. The Rad23 R4BD binds to TGD through a hydrophobic interface, and the Rad23 UBA2 domain, which was not known to interact with XPC or Rad4, through a short intermolecular β-sheet.

According to the PDB entries, this region is unstructured in the Rad4-Rad23 and the Rad4-Rad23-DNA complexes as well. In the Methods section they say that the tertiary complex contains residues 256-369, which is a possible mistake and it should be 256-309.

Rad2 642–690 exists in an extended conformation devoid of any regular secondary structural element with residues 664–678 forming the interface with Tfb1PH.
Taken together with previous results showing that TFIIEαCTD and p53TAD2 compete for binding to Tfb1PH, these results demonstrate that TFIIEαCTD, p53TAD2 and Rad2 642–690 all share for a common binding site on Tfb1PH.
H15N HSQC of 15N-labeled Rad2 642-760. The narrow chemical shift dispersion of the signals indicates that there is no folded domain present.
We first solved a solution structure of the AC-D of hTFIIEα using NMR spectroscopy. The protein has a globular structure with flexible and disordered tails, consisting of the 16 N-terminal residues (amino acids 378–393) and the 5 C-terminal residues (amino acids 435–439).
Polypeptides from F387 to A391 of hTFIIEα AC-D align along the S5 strand of p62 PH-D, forming an antiparallel β-sheet structure with it.
In the free form, it is disordered but upon complex formation becomes fixed, forming a new S0 strand.
In hTFIIEα AC-D, the NMR signals of E386, F387, E388, E389, V390, A391 and D392 were changed significantly upon addition of p62 PH-D.
Residues S40 to K50 do not adopt a well-defined structure within the ensemble, suggesting that this part of the protein is disordered. This was confirmed by the heteronuclear {1H}15N-heteronuclear NOE data (see below, Fig. 4C). Structural statistics are presented in Table 1.
Resonance assignment of MCFD2 allowed localization of the disordered region to the N-terminus of the protein, approximately residues 27–66 (sequence numbered to include the signal sequence).
The N-terminus, residues 27–66, contains very few medium- or long-range restraints and a similar situation is seen for residues 102–112, a flexible loop region.
The NMR spectrum of MCFD2 in calcium-free phosphate buffer at pH 6.0 is characteristic of an unfolded protein, and there is no evidence of secondary structure or of a hydrophobic core.
Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy performed on MCFD2 in the presence and absence of calcium confirms the apparent calcium-dependent folding of the protein seen in the NMR spectrum. 
Authors show the protein is intrinsically unstructured in the absence of calcium by its large negative ellipticity at 200 nm and moderate ellipticity at 190 nm.
Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy performed on MCFD2 in the presence and absence of calcium confirms the apparent calcium-dependent folding of the protein seen in the NMR spectrum. The CD spectrum changes drastically upon addition of calcium (Fig. 3a), and the spectrum of the Ca2+-bound form reveals a dominating contribution from α-helical secondary structure with minima at 207 and 222 nm and a change of sign from negative to positive CD at 197 nm. The calcium-dependent folding is further confirmed by comparison of the CD signal measured at 222 nm as a function of calcium concentration (Fig. 3b).
The spectra of wild-type MCFD2 show higher disorder and proportionally lower helical content, when compared to the spectra of the truncated protein. The calculated difference between the two spectra yields a profile, corresponding to the signal from the first 26 residues of the N-terminus, which is characteristic of an unstructured protein.

In summary, we have shown human MCFD2 to be disordered in the absence of calcium and to adopt a predominantly ordered structure on binding calcium, but with the N-terminus remaining disordered and conformational flexibility in the extended loop between the two EF-hand motifs.

Between the two EF hands is a less well-defined and apparently flexible loop (residues 102–112) that is significantly longer than the equivalent loop in calmodulin. Assignment of the residues in this loop was extremely difficult due to the weak, broadened nature of the observed resonances, indicating conformational flexibility and exchange, as further discussed below.
Only residues 5–63 and 86–112 of Tfb1PH and residues 669–675 of Rad2 were used for the rmsd calculations. Residues at the N terminus (1–4), at the C terminus (113–115), and in the flexible loop (64–85) of Tfb1PH, as well as residues at the N terminus (642–668) and at the C terminus (676–690) of Rad2 were not included in the calculation.
The other difference between Tfb1 and other PH domains occurs in the loop connecting strands ß6 and ß7 (VL3). Tfb11-115 contains a very long (20 residues) and flexible loop that is highly basic. In fact, almost all of the amino acids in this region have 15N-1H heteronuclear NOE values in the range of 0.13-0.40 (data not shown), indicating a high degree of backbone motion on the picosecond to nanosecond time scale.
Structure of the Tfb1PH/EKLFTAD2 Complex. (A) Overlay of the 20 lowest-energy structures of the complex between Tfb1PH (blue) and EKLFTAD2 (yellow). The structures were superimposed using the backbone atoms C′, Cα, and N of residues 4–65 and 85–112 of Tfb1PH and residues 59–84 of EKLFTAD2.
The structure of the Tfb11–115/p5320–73 complex is well defined by the NMR data. Only residues 4–65 and 85–112 of Tfb1 and residues 47–56 of p53 were used for the rmsd calculations.
Residues at the N terminus (1–3), at the C terminus (113–115), and in the flexible loop (64–84) of Tfb1, as well as residues at the N terminus (45–46) and at the C terminus (57–58) of p53, were not included in the calculation.
"However, no electron density can be observed for the first 33 residues of YopM, suggesting that this part of the protein may be disordered."
We pursued NMR structural studies of a complex containing Tfb1PH and EKLFTAD2. EKLFTAD2 binds Tfb1PH in an elongated conformation devoid of any regular secondary structural elements. β-strands β5–β7 and the H1 α-helix of Tfb1PH form an extensive interface with residues between Ala69 and Thr80 of EKLFTAD2, and this is consistent with chemical shift changes of 15N-EKLFTAD2 upon addition of Tfb1PH.
Residues from 107–120 and from 196–215 are disordered in the structure calculations, and increased mobility of this section is confirmed by 15N relaxation measurements (supplementary Fig S2 online).

The two-dimensional 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of SRSF1(RS) had a narrow chemical shift dispersion pointing to extensive structural disorder (Figure 1B).
 In addition, large NMR line-widths (Figure 1B) indicate the presence of conformational exchange occurring on the micro-to-millisecond timescale. Taken together, the NMR data demonstrate that SRSF1(RS) is disordered and highly dynamic.
Phosphorylation strongly changed the 15N-1H HSQC spectrum (Figure 1B).
 Taken together, NMR spectroscopy revealed that phosphorylation of the RS dipeptides in SRSF1(RS) causes a switch from a disordered conformation to a partially rigidified structure.
NMR spectroscopy demonstrated a dramatic phosphorylation-induced change in the flexibility of the RS and RS1 domains of SRSF1 (Figures 1C, 2E, and 2F).
Sequence-specific resonance assignment unambiguously identified phosphorylated serines in the RS repeat stretches comprising residues 204–219 and 242–247.
NMR resonance assignment revealed that serines from S207–S217 were phosphorylated to 100% (Figures 2B and 2D).
Sequence-specific resonance assignment unambiguously identified phosphorylated serines in the RS repeat stretches comprising residues 204–219 and 242–247.
Interestingly, these two regions correlate well with the space most likely taken up by N-terminal residues 1−48 which were not included in the conserved VP16 core structure, and an apparent disordered segment in the crystal (residues 350−394; the boundaries correspond to the termini of the orange helix and strand, respectively).
In the crystal structure, the peptide is disordered between the orange helix and orange strand (residues 350−394).
HSV-1 VP16 amino acid sequences of the KOS and F strains are identical for all 490 residues and differ from strain 17 by only two amino acid substitutions (Asp-Asn at position 13 and Ala-Thr at position 124).
In contrast, the area that the remaining C-terminal “domain” (residues 403−490) is anticipated to occupy (corresponding to the bottom part of the shapes in Figure 5) only shows a small spatial extension to the globular core; i.e., it would not be possible to accommodate all C-terminal residues within the envelope. It seems likely that these residues are responsible for the intensity increase (and indicative of random chainlike behavior) observed in the very low-angle scattering regime.
Thus, we conclude that the C-terminal activation domain is disordered and particularly nonglobular in its native solution state and does not contribute to the globular core but extends into the solvent.

The absence of secondary and tertiary structure in aqueous solution at 35 °C, which is implied by Figure 2, is confirmed by inspection of two-dimensional NOE (NOESY) and rotating-frame NOE (ROESY) spectra of SAD and LAD. Intraresidue and CaH,-NHm sequential NOEs are observed, characteristic of an extended polypeptide chain; however, no sequential NH-NH,+1 NOEs, which are indicative of helical
or nonhelical turns, are observed.
The (1H,15N)-HSQC spectrum of VP16ad shows a small dispersion of intense signals in the proton dimension (<1 ppm), indicative for a lack of secondary structure. 
HSV-1 VP16 amino acid sequences of the KOS and F strains are identical for all 490 residues and differ from strain 17 by only two amino acid substitutions (Asp-Asn at position 13 and Ala-Thr at position 124).
In both activation subdomains negative 1HN, 15N, and 1Hα as well as positive 13Cα and 13C‘ resonance shifts are observed, indicative for α-helix formation.
From these analysis, we can clearly observe the formation of α-helices in the 443−447 and 469−483 region (Figure 4), especially since we have to take into account that resonances have only been mapped until a 1:10 complex.
Nevertheless, the NOE patterns clearly indicate that VP16ad exhibits an α−helical propensity throughout the sequence, except for the proline-rich 453−464 region. Many NOE contacts, indicative for an α-helix, are observed for residues 429−450 and 465−488 in both subdomains.

The limited dispersion of the backbone 15N and1HN chemical shifts in the HSQC spectrum of15N-labeled VP16C alone (Fig.1A) and the intermediate values (∼7 Hz) of 1HN-1HCα coupling constants (11) indicated that VP16C alone has negligible secondary structure (12).

Titration of15N-labeled VP16C with unlabeled TAF1–140 resulted in progressive rather than bimodal changes of the backbone 15N and 1HN chemical shifts (Fig. 1A), thus indicating that VP16C interacts weakly with TAF1–140 and hence exchanges rapidly between the free and bound states on the NMR time scale (13).

Significant chemical shift changes were observed only for the β protons of Asp472, Phe479, Leu483, and Asp486 (Fig.1C). These four residues lie within and adjacent to the region of VP16C that is suggested by backbone chemical shift perturbation to undergo an induced folding transition.

Addition of VP16C (VP16456−490) to 15N-labeled Tfb11−115 produced changes in 1H and 15N chemical shifts for several signals of Tfb11−115 in the 2D 1H−15N HSQC spectra (Figure 1).

As anticipated, free VP16 469–485 exhibited very few NOEs; only sequential NOEs between CαH and NH protons [d α N(i,i+1) NOEs] were clearly observed, indicative of an extended random-coil structure (19).

In contrast, VP16469–485 in the presence of 0.1 mole equivalents of TAF1–140 showed numerous NOE cross-peaks, including a substantial number arising fromdNN(i,i+1),dαN(i,i), and dαβ(i,i+3) NOEs. The overall pattern of the NOE connectivities (Fig.3B) is characteristic of that observed for α-helical secondary structure, especially in the region from Asp472 to Leu483. Thus, residues 472 to 483 of VP16C, and perhaps even residues flanking this region, adopt an α-helical structure when bound to TAF1–140(20).

PC4ntd specifically stimulates the VP16−PC4 interaction for most residues in the 444−448 and 474−484 regions in VP16ad as we observe 2−3-fold increased chemical shift changes in these regions for the VP16ad−PC4 versus the VP16ad−PC4ctd interaction.
For the titrations of 15N-labeled VP16 with PC4 (Figures 1 and 2), we observed broadening and disappearance of peaks due to the formation of a larger complex and exchange between the PC4-bound and free VP16ad.

NMR titration experiments (Figures 1 and 2) indicate that both VP16 activation subdomains are involved in the interaction with PC4 and TFIIBc. Deletion analysis shows that the VP16ad/n region fails to interact while VP16ad/c has a reduced binding affinity (>20 times compared to the full VP16ad) for PC4 (Figure 3A), indicating that both VP16 activation subdomains are required for high-affinity cooperative binding.

The spectrum is contoured at a high threshold to emphasize intense correlations from flexible regions. These correlations belong to residues at the NH2 and COOH termini.
V8 proteolysis produces two fragments of 6984.8 and 7227.4 daltons, whereas trypsin digestion yields a single proteolytic product of 7682.7 daltons. These fragments mapped the proteolytic cleavage sites immediately carboxyl-terminal to residues Glu-63 and Glu-65 (in the case of V8), and Lys-69 (in the case of trypsin) in the intact protein (Fig. 2).
Collectively, our analyses suggest three alternative structural models for HSBP1 (Fig. 1 C): 1) a single continuous helix, 2) two noninteracting helices separated by a linker region (residues 35–40), and 3) two interacting helices arranged in an anti-parallel orientation. In each of the models, the helical regions or portions thereof can engage in intermolecular interactions, giving rise to a higher order oligomer.
Most of the intense resonances correspond to residues at the less conserved carboxyl terminus extending approximately from Gly-60 to Ser-76. The Hα secondary chemical shifts and the pattern of1H-1H NOEs (data not shown) further indicate the absence of regular secondary structure in this region. Thus, NMR analyses and limited proteolysis both establish that the carboxyl terminus of HSBP1 is unstructured and flexible.

In addition, in all four chains, five residues at the C-termini, and between eight to twelve residues in two internal loops (Pro344 to Gly355; Glu401 to Glu402), are disordered. These loops are not directly involved in histidine or ATP binding.
The first 26 residues from the N-terminus exhibited random-coil amide chemical shifts with non-uniform intensities, indicating that the N-terminal region is indeed solvent-exposed and dynamically disordered. 

C-terminal residues (206–218) also have chemical shifts consistent with a random coil.
Inspection of the final NMR ensemble of 15 structures (see Table 1 for statistics) reveals a disordered N-terminus (1–31). This fact is also borne out by the extremely low 15N-{1H} NOE values (0.08 ± 0.21; see Figure 1) for this region. However, some degree of local ordering is seen encompassing residues Asp15–Thr19 (15N-{1H} NOE: 0.18 ± 0.01).
The N-terminal part of the protein from Met1 to Val32 is disordered and represented in gray.
Consistent with the absence of long-range NOEs, the 32 first residues adopt a random-coil conformation, with the exception of residues Ala22 to Phe27 that form a short dynamic helix, essentially defined by TALOS restraints.
The others residues, corresponding to the 133–429 PG-rich peptidic segment, gave rise to the intense cross-peaks centered at 8.5 ppm in the proton dimension of the [1H,15N] HSQC spectrum of the full-length protein, thus strongly suggesting that this segment adopts a random-coil conformation.
As shown in Figure 6A, the 1H NMR spectrum of prothymosin at pH 8.0 was characteristic of a highly denatured protein. The resonances were sharp (indicating a high degree of rapid local segmental motion), the amide proton resonances were weak in intensity (indicating little regular hydrogen bonding due to hydrogen exchange with bulk solvent), and the spectrum was poorly dispersed.

The resonances were sharp (indicating a high degree of rapid local segmental motion), the amide proton resonances were weak in intensity (indicating little regular hydrogen bonding due to hydrogen exchange with bulk solvent), and the spectrum was poorly dispersed. At pH 2.4 (Figure 6B), prothymosin still gave a spectrum characteristic of a denatured protein, although significant differences were observed as compared to pH 8.5. These differences included changes in the chemical shifts of some carbon-attached protons (which, being nonexchangeable, should not be dependent on the pH of the bulk solvent) and an increase in the line widths of some aliphatic resonances. These observations strongly suggest that a structural change had occurred, with the polypeptide becoming more compact and ordered.
 1H,15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of the individual proteins exhibit low dispersion of the 1H chemical shifts, as expected for IDPs14,21-23 (Fig. 1e,f).
ProTα acts as a linker histone chaperone by interacting with H1 and increasing its mobility in the nucleus. Here we show that ProTα and H1 bind to one another with very high affinity, but that both proteins fully retain their structural disorder.
We found ProTα to interact with calcium at micromolar affinity (~70 μM; Figure 1H).
This is reflected in its affinity for calcium and a greater number of calcium binding sites, with ProTα interacting with ~10 calcium ions (Figure 1I), the same stoichiometry as was previously reported [44].
Given the high number, extensive spreading and overlapping ion binding regions in ProTα, the entire sequence could be annotated. Despite this fact, it is observable in figure 2 that the first 15 residues of the N-terminus do not follow chemical shift upon calcium binding. Therefore, they are excluded. 
The NMR peaks from the highly acidic stretch overlap and addition of calcium led to large changes in chemical shifts, meaning that we could not follow all individual peaks and quantify their CSPs (regions indicated by red in Figure 1E).

The inset to Figure 2 shows that at pH 7.5 ProTα is characterized by a far-UV CD spectrum, which is typical of unfolded proteins, but at pH 2.5 a considerable rearrangement of the spectrum is observed.

Such far-UV CD spectral changes can be explained by the appearance of some α-helix in the protein at low pH ( 45, 46)
 The inset to Figure 3 shows that in the case of ProTα a decrease in pH leads to considerable changes in ANS fluorescence (compare curves 1 and 2), reflecting the pH-induced transformation to the partially folded compact conformation. The formation of this intermediate is reflected in the pH dependence of the ANS fluorescence intensity (see Figure 3). The pH dependence of free ANS is also presented for comparison. It follows from Figure 3 that the transition from unfolded to partially folded conformation takes place between pH 5.5 and pH 3.5

The results of chromatographic analysis are presented in Table 2. It is evident that the hydrodynamic dimensions of ProTα at neutral pH are close to those measured in the presence of 8 M urea. The small difference between the two values is due to swelling of the unfolded polypeptide chain in a good solvent ( 20). Both values are virtually indistinguishable from RS, calculated for the completely unfolded protein with a molecular mass of 12.21 kDa.

Table 2 shows that a decrease in pH leads to a pronounced decrease of the ProTα hydrodynamic dimension. It should be emphasized that the RS value determined for ProTα at pH 2.5 is still far from that expected for a globular protein of 12 kDa.
The profile of the Kratky plot at neutral pH is typical for a random coil conformation, whereas at pH 2.5 considerable change in the shape of the scattering curves is detected, reflecting the presence of more ordered conformation under such conditions.

Figure 7 shows that the denaturant-induced unfolding of the ProTα acid state represents a very broad transition characterized by the absence of the sigmoid shape, typical of the unfolding of native and molten globule conformations ( 50, 51).
The CD spectra of unbound ProTα and H1 reflect the low secondary structure content of the individual IDPs, except for the small helix-turn-helix domain of H113,19,20 (Fig. 1c).
The dominant contribution to the interaction with ProTα stems from the unstructured C-terminal part of H1, which alone binds with picomolar affinity. The N-terminal half and the isolated globular domain of H1 also bind ProTα, but with much lower affinity (Fig. 2b). At least four isolated globular domains can bind to ProTα at the same time, with modest chemical shift changes (Extended Data Fig. 1), suggesting the absence of a specific binding interface.
We have determined the solution NMR structure of a recombinant peptide that consists of the first 156 residues of erythroid α-spectrin. The first 20 residues preceding the first helix (helix C′) are in a disordered conformation.

The Intrinsically Disordered Protein Atg13 Mediates Supramolecular Assembly of Autophagy Initiation Complexes
An essential autophagy factor Atg13 has a large intrinsically disordered region (IDR)
Using structural and biological techniques, we herein demonstrate that Atg13 has a large intrinsically disordered region (IDR) and interacts with two distinct Atg17 molecules using two binding regions in the IDR.
In the HS-AFM images of Atg13-MBP, the linkage of two globules by a string-like structure was apparent (Figure 1F and Movie S1). One of the globules was often observed to undergo transitions between ordered and disordered states within 1 s, whereas the other globule was always in an ordered state, indicating that the former is Atg13HORMA while the latter is MBP. The string-like structure is constantly disordered and highly flexible (Movie S1). This clearly demonstrates that the C-terminal region of Atg13 is actually intrinsically disordered, and thus is named IDR hereafter.
The IDR corresponds to the C-terminal region (residues 269–738).
The IDR of Atg13 exhibited temporarily appearing and disappearing small globules, resulting in a double-Gaussian distribution of R_2D. Since the four small regions within the IDR are known to interact with Atg1 or Atg17, the small globules probably correspond to these regions.
We previously identified the first Atg17-binding region of Atg13, named Atg1317BR (residues 424–436), in which Ser428 and Ser429 are phosphorylated under nutrient-rich conditions but are dephosphorylated in response to starvation, thus enhancing the interaction with Atg17 (Fujioka et al., 2014). Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that Atg17 efficiently co-precipitated with GFP-Atg13 (Figure 1A, lanes 11 and 12), but not with GFP-Atg13 variants containing the S429D or F430A mutation in Atg1317BR (Figure 1A, lanes 13–16), confirming that Atg1317BR is crucial for the interaction with Atg17.
The IDR of Atg13 contains two distinct regions binding intermolecularly to Atg17
We also revealed that Atg13 interacts with Atg17 via a small portion (residues 424–436), called the Atg17-binding region (Atg1317BR), and found that the Atg1317BR-Atg17 interaction is also promoted by starvation-dependent dephosphorylation of Ser428 and Ser429 in Atg1317BR. 
We next investigated the binding affinity of the Atg1317LR-Atg17 interaction by ITC. This analysis showed that a synthetic Atg1317LR peptide (residues 359–389) bound to Atg17 with a KD value of 2.0 μM (Figure 1E), indicating that although the Atg1317LR-Atg17 interaction is ∼10-fold weaker than the Atg1317BR-Atg17 interaction (Figure 1B, 220 nM), Atg1317LR can interact with Atg17 independently of Atg1317BR.
The IDR of Atg13 contains two distinct regions binding intermolecularly to Atg17
Because Atg13 is a key factor that tethers Atg1 and Atg17 to form the Atg1 complex (Fujioka et al., 2014), we next investigated whether the Atg1317LR-Atg17 interaction is required for PAS organization. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that in cells expressing wild-type Atg13 or the S379A mutant, Atg17-GFP assembled to form the PAS upon rapamycin treatment (Figure 3D). However, in cells expressing the F375A mutant, the PAS was not observed at all (Figure 3D), and the S379D mutant was also defective in the PAS formation (Figure 3D). These observations indicate that the Atg1317LR-Atg17 interaction is required for PAS assembly.
Atg1317LR-Atg17 Interaction Is Crucial for PAS Assembly and Autophagy In Vivo
We next tested the intermolecular binding model (Figure 4E, right). For this purpose, we examined whether a short fragment of Atg13 containing Atg1317LR and Atg1317BR (residues 359–459) can interlink the Atg17-Atg29-Atg31 complexes in vitro (Figure 5A). By centrifugation, the Atg17-Atg29-Atg31 complex alone was almost completely recovered in the supernatant fraction (Figure 5A, lane 1). However, on addition of the Atg13 fragment, nearly half of the Atg17-Atg29-Atg31 complex became precipitable (Figure 5A, lane 4), probably due to aggregate formation by excess interlinking among the Atg13 fragments and the Atg17-Atg29-Atg31 complexes. In contrast, the addition of an Atg13 fragment bearing a mutation in Atg1317LR (S379D) or Atg1317BR (S429D) did not result in the precipitation of the Atg17-Atg29-Atg31 complex by centrifugation (Figure 5A, lanes 6 and 8).
These results suggest that the short Atg13 fragment can link the Atg17-Atg29-Atg31 complexes with each other via Atg1317LR and Atg1317BR, irrespective of other Atg13 regions such as Atg1317BR2. These results strongly support the intermolecular binding of Atg1317LR and Atg1317BR to the Atg17-Atg29-Atg31 complexes.
We further investigated the formation of the large Atg1 complexes by analytical ultracentrifugation. By use of wild-type Atg13-MBP, we observed large assemblages with sedimentation coefficient(s) of 15–20 S (Figure 5B). By contrast, when we used the Atg1317LR and Atg1317BR mutant, the 15- to 20-S supramolecular complex was barely detectable; instead, we observed a moderately sized complex with sedimentation coefficient of ∼10 S (Figure 5B), still larger than the Atg17-Atg29-Atg31 complex alone (sedimentation coefficient of ∼5 S). These results suggest that Atg13 mediates multimeric assembly of the Atg1 complexes via Atg1317LR and Atg1317BR, leading in turn to generation of the 15- to 20-S supramolecular complexes.

These results suggest that Atg13 mediates multimeric assembly of the Atg1 complexes via Atg1317LR and Atg1317BR, leading in turn to generation of the 15- to 20-S supramolecular complexes.
Gel-filtration analysis showed that recombinant Atg1ΔKD-Atg13-MBP and Atg17-Atg29-Atg31 subcomplexes were distributed in fractions 15–16 and 12–14, respectively (Figures 5C and S5A). Upon mixing these two subcomplexes (10 μM each), all five components were co-distributed in large fractions (fractions 5–8) in a manner dependent on both Atg1317BR and Atg1317LR (Figure S5A). These results suggest that the five components interact with each other to form large complexes, a process in which Atg1317LR and Atg1317BR play an essential role.

We next studied the importance of the Atg13-mediated self-assembly of Atg1 complexes in vivo. Consistent with the in vitro biochemical analyses, fluorescence microscopy showed that PAS assembly of Atg17-GFP and Atg13-mCherry (i.e., the multimeric assembly of the Atg1 complexes in vivo) strictly required both Atg1317BR and Atg1317LR (Figure 6A): upon mutation in Atg1317BR or Atg1317LR, the PAS was barely detectable (Figure 6A), even when PAS formation was enhanced using a kinase-dead form of Atg1 (D211A) (Sekito et al., 2009).
Altogether, these data indicate that Atg13 links the Atg17-Atg29-Atg31 complexes via two distinct regions, Atg1317BR and Atg1317LR, thus leading to multimeric assembly of Atg1 complexes.
Atg13-Mediated Self-Assembly of Atg1 Complexes Is Required for Initial Events in Autophagy
Atg13[571-700] is intrinsically disordered
After screening several C-terminal constructs for expression and solubility in E. coli, we succeeded in purifying Atg13[571–700]. As expected, this region was intrinsically disordered as observed by 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectroscopy and circular dichroism (CD) (Figures S1 and S2).
Atg13[571-700] binds negatively charged liposomes
Full-length Atg13 was shown to bind yeast polar lipids [2], suggesting that electrostatic interactions may play an important role in liposome binding by the Atg13[571–700] peptide. To test if this is the case, we performed liposome sedimentation assays in the presence of increasing concentrations of NaCl (Figure 1D,E). If electrostatic interactions are required for membrane binding, then increasing NaCl concentrations will disrupt this interaction. We found that Atg13[571–700] bound to Folch liposomes in buffer containing either 50 or 150 mM NaCl, but that binding was almost completely abolished in buffer containing 300 or 500 mM NaCl. This result suggests that Atg13 binding to liposomes is mediated primarily through electrostatic interactions. In agreement with this result, Atg13[571–700] also bound yeast polar lipids, and this binding was severely disrupted by a NaCl concentration higher than 50 mM (Figure 1 F,G).
To further examine the role of the 640KFK and 683KFHK motifs in liposome binding, we mutated the Atg13[571–700] sequence to F641G I645G, F641E I645E, or K683E H685E K686E. Liposome sedimentation assays were performed in 50, 150, 300 and 500 mM NaCl. All 3 mutants were significantly defective in membrane binding at a physiological concentration of 150 mM NaCl, with more than 60% reduction relative to wild type (Figure 2B). A summary of all truncation and mutagenesis data is presented in Figure S5. These data suggest that Atg13[571–700] contains 2 distinct liposome-binding motifs, 640KFK (site I) and 683KFHK (site II) (Figure 1A) and that electrostatic force is not a sole factor responsible for lipid binding of the Atg13[571–700] region. A hydrophobic insertion of aromatic residues in the motifs plays a role in binding efficiency, in agreement with data in Figure 1.

To investigate whether mutations in the phospholipid-binding sites I and II of Atg13 (640KFK and 683KFHK) affect binding with Vac8, we tested the binding affinity of the Atg13 glycine and glutamate mutants with Vac8 relative to wild type. As indicated above, we also constructed a mutant with a presumably disrupted interaction between the Atg13 peptide and Vac8. The D651R Q666R P667R mutant carries cationic residues in the Vac8-binding region to repulse the peptide from the positively charged Vac8 groove. We applied isothermal calorimetry (ITC) to measure dissociation constants for Atg13[571–700] binding to recombinant purified Vac8[10–515]. The WT and all of the mutated Atg13[571–700] peptides, except for Atg13[571–700]D651,Q666,P667R, bound to Vac8 with dissociation constants from 227–736 nM (Table 1), confirming that the Atg13[571–700] region carries the Vac8-binding domain, and that the Atg13 residues required for liposome binding are not required for Vac8 binding (Figure 3A). Atg13[571–700]D651,Q666,P667R bound to Vac8 with the lowest affinity (Kd of 1885 nM; Table 1), demonstrating that the Atg13 region between the phospholipid site I and II (Figure S6A) is involved in Vac8 binding, in agreement with the crystallographic data.

The lipid- and Vac8-binding capability of Atg13 are required for efficient autophagy
To determine if nonselective autophagy activity is affected by a chromosomal mutation in the phospholipid- and Vac8-binding motifs of the full-length Atg13 protein, we performed the quantitative Pho8Δ60 assay, in which Pho8Δ60 is a cytosolic zymogen of the vacuolar Pho8 phosphatase that lacks the first 60 amino acids of its N terminus. Vacuolar localization and activation of this zymogen relies on nonselective autophagy [22]. Cells with wild-type (WT) Atg13 exhibited a substantial increase in Pho8Δ60 activity after 3 h of nitrogen starvation (Figure 5A). In comparison, the F641E I645E, K683E H685E K686E, and D651R Q666R P667R mutants showed an ~30% decrease in Pho8Δ60 activity; the F641G I645G mutant was even more defective, as it exhibited an ~50% decrease in autophagy activity under the same experimental conditions.
Atg13 IDR mutants reduce autophagy activity. (A) Autophagy activity was measured by the Pho8Δ60 assay in WT and atg13∆ strains, and in cells expressing the F641E I645E, F641G I645G, K683E H685E K686E, or D651R Q666R P667R mutants under nutrient-rich conditions (+N) and after 3 h of nitrogen starvation (-N 3 h).
Autophagy was measured using the GFP-Atg8 processing assay in the same strains as in (A) under nutrient-rich conditions and after 1 or 2 h of nitrogen starvation.
The summary diagram of the lipid- and Vac8-binding capability and autophagy activity of the Atg13 mutants (Figure 5D) shows that the Atg13 protein promotes efficient autophagy only when its interaction with both phospholipids and Vac8 is intact and thereby balanced.
Again, these data suggest that the Atg13-phospholipd interaction needs to be effective and in concert with the Atg13-Vac8 interaction to maintain an optimal balance in localization of Atg13 in proximity to the vacuole; too little or too much binding to either component is detrimental to autophagy (Figures 5 and 6).
Atg1317LR is essential for autophagy.
The Atg1317LR-binding region of Atg17 is required for autophagy.
We further examined several Atg17 mutants by the ALP assay and found that the I385A, P393A, and T395A mutants exhibited severe defects in autophagy (Figure 3F).
Furthermore, Atg1317LR and Atg1317BR were strictly required for autophagy as estimated by the ALP assay (Figure 4C). However, deletion of or mutations in Atg1317BR2 only slightly reduced autophagic activity even in the atg11Δ background (Figure 4C). We also found that GFP-Atg13 bearing a double mutation in Atg1317LR and Atg1317BR (F375A F430A) did not precipitate Atg17 at all (Figure 4D, lane 16), even though it still contains Atg1317BR2. It should be noted that to detect weak interactions between Atg13 and Atg17, we used a mild detergent condition (0.1% NP-40) in this experiment. These results indicate that Atg1317LR and Atg1317BR, but not Atg1317BR2, are responsible for starvation-induced autophagy.
Region corresponding to Atg1317LR peptide (residues 359–389).
Atg1317LR is essential for autophagy.
The Atg1317LR-binding region of Atg17 is required for autophagy.
We further examined several Atg17 mutants by the ALP assay and found that the I385A, P393A, and T395A mutants exhibited severe defects in autophagy (Figure 3F).

CD spectra showed that Atg13 (460–521) is intrinsically disordered in solution (Supplementary Fig. 1c).
We found that 62 amino acids (residues 460–521) of Atg13 are necessary and sufficient for Atg1 binding (Supplementary Fig. 1b).
The N terminus from A2 to D12 and the linker between the two zinc-binding domains, from N69 to D92, are disordered. This is demonstrated by heteronuclear 1H–15N NOE measurements (Figure 4).

 We have determined the solution structure of a 127 residue fragment of ZFa, which consists of two zinc finger domains connected by a linker that remains unstructured in the free protein in solution.
The remaining 18 or 19 residues to the C-terminus (residue 191) had no clear electron density and were not modeled.
Except for the 10 first residues that are highly flexible [negative (1H-15N)-NOE values], the 2 qRRMs possess a rigid core [(1H-15N)-NOE values higher than 0.7]. The linker region (residues 100–110), however, shows low (1H-15N)-NOE values (between 0.19 and 0.5), which indicates that the linker between the two qRRMs is flexible and suggests that the two qRRMs tumble independently in solution.

the characteristic circular dichroism (CD) signature observed for full-length Bpa, which features two minima at 208 and 220 nm (Figure 1B). Based on our in silico analysis, we generated a truncation variant (HisBpa36–159), from which the non-homologous and likely disordered regions were excluded. The CD spectrum of this variant shows the same overall shape with a slightly stronger helical signal

Thus, the poor definition of the calcium-binding loops in human apo-S100B is most consistent with flexibility of the backbone within these regions.
Calcium binding loop I
In the tertiary structure of S100B, residues with exchange contributions are grouped around the mobile C-terminal loop
(Figure 4, panel C). Exchange is detected for all HSQC correlations from the last turn of helix 4 (V80) to the
C-terminus at E91, and no correlations are observed for residues H85, E86, and F87 due to exchange broadening. ..this region of the protein is mobile on the chemical shift time scale.
Main interaction site for multiple S100B protein interactors.
Authors said " Fifteen residues are missing at the C-terminal of the model due to the flexibility of the protein
sequence making interpretation impossible". I just annotated the region of missing electron density.
Authors said about this region "Apparent structural  disorder, indicated by a large dispersion among the 20 conformers"
Missing electron density
Authors said "However, electron density for residues 161–178 and 199–211 was not observed in the absence of bound I-Tyr. This is presumably due to disorder and/or dynamics of these regions. "
About these regions, the authos claimed "However,
these regions were evident from a co-crystal containing I-Tyr. Under these conditions, a helix and loop surrounding the active site are stabilized. The helix in particular covers the active site and helps to sequester the I-TyrFMN complex from solvent"

The intrinsically flexible nature of the C-terminal segment (52–97) was confirmed by the observation of quite intense peaks in 2D [15N,1H]-HSQC, which reflect long T2-spin relaxation times arising from large scale and rapid motional modes superimposed onto the overall rotational tumbling.

The residues the authors are referring to corresponds to the 52-89 region of this Uniprot.
The high intensity of the peaks corresponding to the C-terminal region of TnI, relative to the size of the troponin complex and the intensity of peaks from other regions of the protein, suggests that this is a very flexible region which moves independently from the rest of the complex.
Although the relaxation data clearly show that this region is flexible, one possibility to explain the presence of the plateau is the presence of some sort of nascent structure. A second possibility is that this profile is an intrinsic property of disordered regions in general. We found that similar results can be recognized in other IDRs attached to globular domains using 15N relaxation data.
The spectra  recorded  for  the b1wt peptide showed no distinct minima at 222 nm and a strong minimum at ~200 nm (Fig.8A ), indicating that the b1wt peptide contains little a-helix (~13% by  least-squared regression analysis).
The integrin b1 cytoplasmic tails self-interact in a specific and dose-dependent manner as shown  by surface plasmon resonance analysis.
We present cocrystal structures of KRIT1 with ICAP1 and ICAP1 with integrin β1 cytoplasmic tail to 2.54 and 3.0 Å resolution (the resolutions at which I/σI = 2 are 2.75 and 3.0 Å, respectively).

Here, we report the first structure of talin bound to an authentic full-length beta integrin tail.
We used high-resolution mass spectrometry to identify3600 lysine acetylation sites on 1750 proteins and quantified acetylation changes in responseto the deacetylase inhibitors suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and MS-275.
We report here that the Arg kinase domain interacts directly with a lysine-rich membrane-proximal segment in the integrin β1 cytoplasmic tail, that Arg phosphorylates the membrane-proximal Tyr-783 in the β1 tail, and that the Arg Src homology domain then engages this phosphorylated region in the tail.
The amounts of integrin β1 and phosphorylated Thr-788/Thr-789 β1 were detected by immunoblotting in cells with or without SDF1-α activation.
Preventing Ser-785 or Thr 788/789 phosphorylation reduced adhesion, suggesting that phosphorylation regulates adhesiveness.

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) tyrosine phosphorylation and activation were severely impaired in response to beta1-dependent adhesion in GD25-beta1A(Y783/795F) cells compared to that in wild-type GD25-beta1A or mutants in which only a single tyrosine was altered (beta1A(Y783F) or beta1A(Y795F)). 
The integrin b1 cytoplasmic tails self-interact in a specific and dose-dependent manner as shown by surface plasmon resonance analysis.
The structure also shows that residues Gly-12–Val-39 at the N terminus of sRbx112–108 are disordered, as indicated from a lack of inter-residue or long distance NOEs and near zero or negative 15N{1H} heteronuclear NOEs (supplemental Fig. 1).
Taken together, these data suggest that residues Gly-12–Val-39 at the N terminus of sRbx112–108 in the absence of a bound cullin molecule are disordered.
Four residues (W27S, V30S, L32Q, and W33S) were mutated in order to improve the solubility.
The structure shows that the N terminus of Rbx1/ROC1 undergoes a large structural rearrangement from a disordered conformation to a structured β-strand in the CRL complex.
Structures of Rbx1/ROC1 in complex with cullin proteins show that the N terminus of Rbx1/ROC1 forms an ordered 16-residue intermolecular β-sheet with the C-terminal domain of the cullin scaffold protein (Fig. 2C; Ref 7).
Combining these results, we suggest that the N terminus of Rbx1/ROC1 undergoes a dramatic disordered-to-ordered conformational transition that is induced by protein-protein interactions with CUL1 (Fig. 2, A and C).
Four residues (W27S, V30S, L32Q, and W33S) were mutated in order to improve the solubility.
The 16-residue Rbx1 β strand, which contains a kink in the middle, makes β-sheet backbone hydrogen bonds with the S1, S2 and S3 strands of Cul1, and it participates in the formation of the α/β hydrophobic core. The conserved Phe 22 and Trp 27 of Rbx1 have a central role, making multiple van der Waals contacts to side chains from the WH-A, H25, S1, S2 and S3 of Cul1 (Fig. 3b). The Cul1 residues involved in these interactions are highly conserved in Cul1 orthologues and paralogues (Fig. 3b and see Supplementary Information), indicating that other combinations of cullin and Rbx family members will form a similar intermolecular β-sheet. After the Rbx1 β strand, a tryptophan-rich Rbx1 region (Trp 33–Ala 34–Trp 35) packs both with the α/β domain and the following RING domain, resulting in a continuous surface between the two.

SCF complexes are the largest family of E3 ubiquitin–protein ligases and mediate the ubiquitination of diverse regulatory and signalling proteins.
The N-terminus of PRPF4 is an intrinsically disordered region and does not adopt secondary structure in the presence of PPIH
Using circular dichroism (CD) we find that in solution the cortactin repeats resemble a coil-like intrinsically disordered protein. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) also indicates that the cortactin repeats are intrinsically unfolded
although circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy also demonstrates that MRI is an intrinsically disordered protein, the addition of trifluoroethanol (TFE), a helix-inducing crowding agent, resulted in CD spectra suggestive that MRI has the potential to form helical structures
Signals in NMR spectra of AR displayed narrow line widths and limited dispersion typical of unfolded proteins (Figure 3), and the absence of residues with positive heteronuclear 1H–15N NOE indicated that AR is highly flexible (Figure 4) [...] SSP scores [...] suggesting that AR contains little or no secondary structure. Hence, our data are consistent with AR being intrinsically disordered
The region 306-322 contains an LxCxE motif that mediates binding to the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor with Kd 480nM. "Residues 306–322 (KEPEIRCDEKPEDLLEE) were the most affected by RbAB binding (Figure 7). This sequence contains the IRCDE motif that was proposed to mediate the interaction with Rb.21". "A single binding event with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 480 nM was observed (Figure 8A and Table 1)."
The 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectra of AR-N and AR-C are shown in Figure 9. For virtually every signal in these spectra, there is a counterpart at the same position in the 1H–15NHSQC spectrum of AR (data not shown). [...] consistent with absence of long-range interactions between residues 197–269 or 297–341 and the rest of AR.
The AR-N region binds to retinoblastoma with low affinity (Kd 170µM). "The interaction of FITC-RIZ(254–267) with RbAB was readily observed by this method (Figure 11A), and fitting of the anisotropy data yielded a Kd of ~170 μM (Table 2). We also used a competitive binding assay with the FITC-RIZ(254–267) peptide (Figure 11B) and established that AR-N binds to RbAB with comparable affinity (Kd ~ 90 μM) (Table 2)."

The far-UV CD spectrum of full-length P, PCED, PCTD, and PΔ91–131 exhibited two dichroic bands near 208 nm and 222 nm, indicating the presence of α-helical structure, while the spectrum obtained with PNTD showed one minor dichroic band near 222 nm and one below 200 nm, suggesting a low α-helical content (Fig. 6).
The hydrodynamic radii (Stokes' radius, RS) of full-length P, PNTD, PCED, PCTD, PΔC120, and PΔ91–131 were determined by calibrating the SEC column with standard proteins.71 On a plot of the hydrodynamic radius as a function of molecular mass (Fig. 7b), PCED and PCTD appeared as native globular proteins, PΔ91–131, PΔC120, and full-length P were intermediate between native and unfolded proteins, indicating that these proteins are non-globular, and PNTD appeared as an unfolded protein.
Residues missing in electron density. Numbers in the manuscripts mentioning disorder in the N-terminal ligand binding domain always refer to mature protein lacking the signal peptide (residues 1-22).
The N- and C-terminal segments, residues 15−25 and 127−136, respectively, exhibit no detectable long-range NOE interactions and are structurally disordered (Figure 4B).

The most striking difference lies with seven residues of the flexible N-terminal extension of TβRII that become ordered in the ternary complex, providing extensive receptor-receptor contact (Figure 2A and Figure S2).
The bulk of receptor-receptor interaction arises from seven residues of the disordered N-terminal extension of TβRII that become ordered in the ternary complex and tether TβRI to its docking site at the composite interface.

It also displays two large unstructured regions at the N terminus (residues 1–24) and in a large loop near the middle of the protein (residues 46–62).
The structure of gpFII consists of a single domain, with two large disordered regions; one at the N terminus (residues 1–24), and one in the middle of the protein (residues 46–62), both of which are characterized by no medium or long range NOEs.

Unstructured regions of gpFII (Fig. S2A) and gpV (3) were delineated by measuring {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOEs.
The NMR solution structure of gpFII displays significant disorder. (A) Values of the heteronuclear {1H}15N NOE as a function of position in gpFII. Residues that fall below the red horizontal line representing a cutoff of +0.65 show increased dynamics on the fast, ns-ps time scale (1). These include residues 1–24, 46–62, and 109–117.
In this model, the large N-terminal unstructured region (residues 1–24) of gpFII protrudes from one side of the ring whereas much of the central β3–β4 unstructured region (residues 46–62) is positioned on the opposite side.

One of the most strongly dominant-negative mutants, Δ53–61, was titrated into a reaction containing a constant level of WT protein (Fig. S4). The inhibitory effect of this mutant was found to be strongly dose-dependent, and the curve of inhibition versus protein concentration could be fit by an exponential function assuming a simple competition between WT and mutant gpFII molecules. Fitting of these curves indicated that, if one third of the gpFII molecules incorporated into a phage were mutant, assembly would be inhibited. Further in vitro activity assays and EM experiments clearly showed that the Δ53–61 mutant inhibited phage assembly through its ability to bind heads, but not tails (SI Methods and Tables S2 and S3).
Taken together, the behavior of the gpFII mutants supports our model of the oligomeric structure of gpFII within phage particles.

Equal volumes of purified WT and Δ53–61 gpFII protein were mixed in vitro before testing for com- plementation of an FIIam extract. WT protein was kept at a concentration of 1 μM and Δ53–61 gpFII protein concentration was varied from 0.1 to 50 μM. Even at very low ratios, e.g., 1:1, the Δ53–61 gpFII protein was able to exert a dominant negative effect on WT protein.
Deletions of the N-terminal unstructured region, which is predicted to lie on the top surface, caused no dominant-negative behavior. Furthermore, combining an N-terminal deletion with the Δ46–61 deletion resulted in no dominant-negative phenotype, implying that activity of the putative head-binding gpFII N terminus is required for imparting a dominant negative phenotype.
Taken together, the behavior of the gpFII mutants supports our model of the oligomeric structure of gpFII within phage particles. Mutants bearing amino acid substitutions or deletions on the putative bottom surface displayed dominant-negative phenotypes because they could still bind heads and thereby inhibit the assembly of phage even in the presence of WT gpFII. By contrast, deletion of the N-terminal region, which is expected to be involved in head-binding, caused loss of activity without a dominant-negative effect.

Indeed, while the CD spectrum of Jbtx in the absence of SDS presented a minimum centred at ca. 200 nm, characteristic of a random coil conformation, in the presence of 3–15 mM SDS this feature shifted to ∼205–210 nm, with the insurgence of a minimum at around 207 nm, typical of the presence of α-helices and β-sheets; consistently, the ellipticity increase around 195 nm suggests the acquisition of secondary structure by Jbtx in the presence of SDS micelles.
Superimposition of the NMR spectra of Jbtx in the absence and presence of bicelles revealed some changes in the chemical shift of a number of amino acids, even though the characteristic profile of an intrinsically disordered protein was maintained (Fig. 7B and D).

Compared to the CD spectrum of free Jbtx, which showed a pronounced negative peak around 200 nm typical of random coil structures, the CD spectrum of Jbtx in the presence of negatively charged bicelles shows a reduced intensity in the random coil region, indicative of an increase in the polypeptide secondary structure content (Fig. 7A).

The 1H,15N-HSQC NMR spectrum of Jbtx, recorded in the absence and presence of SDS below and above its CMC (0.25 and 10–15 mM, respectively, Fig. 3C) reveals that the protein does not change its structure in the presence of SDS below its CMC, while large chemical shifts modifications are observed in solutions containing SDS above the CMC, indicative of structural conformational changes.
The SDS/PAGE profile of the final purified protein is shown in Fig. 1C. Notably, although the predicted molecular mass determined from the amino acid sequence of Jaburetox with the six-histidine extension is 11 kDa, the protein exhibited a 2 kDa shift in the SDS/PAGE and migrated as a 13 kDa polypeptide.
The hydrodynamic radius measured by QELS is 2.7 ± 0.1 nm. This value is larger than the expected value of 1.74 nm for a well-folded protein of the same molecular mass [31], and is very close to that predicted for intrinsically disordered pre-molten globular proteins (2.46 nm) or random coil proteins (2.77 nm) of the same molecular mass [31].
The CD spectrum of the protein under native conditions (Fig. 2A) presents features typical of a random coil conformation, with a minimum centered at 200 nm.
Figure 4 shows the 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of Jaburetox. The spectrum is characterized by low signal dispersion in the proton dimension, indicative of a disordered state of the protein.
The NMR-derived solution structural ensemble of Jaburetox, featuring large values of rmsd, confirms its disordered fold, as predicted by earlier [23] and the present bioinformatics studies (Fig. 3).
As shown in Fig. 4, the lethal effect of Jaburetox-2Ec was time dependent, with a lag phase of 3–4 days and 100% mortality being reached after 11 days. Mortality of canatoxin-fed insects showed a slower rate with 20% insects still alive at the end of the experiments.
A lag phase of 2 days was observed before lethality of the insects and on sixth day, after ingesting a total of 47 μg jaburetox-2Ec, all larvae were dead (Fig. 5B).
In this context it is noteworthy to mention that neurotoxic symptoms (such as paralysis and uncoordinated movements of limbs and antenna) are seen in R. prolixus intoxicated by Jaburetox-2Ec.
The CTE of hERR2 appears to be disordered, having no identifiable secondary structure. This is based on (a) C-α chemical shifts that approach random coil values; (b) reduced heteronuclear {1H-15N} NOEs; (c) the appearance of an additional six HSQC peaks when gradient pulses or spin-lock purge pulses are used, rather than presaturation, for water suppression; and (d) sequential NOEs that are either weak or absent.
The 26-amino acid CTE has been proposed to provide sequence-specific contacts with the 5′-base pairs in the response element (TCAAGGTCA in hERR2).
As often observed for intrinsically unstructured proteins, all expressed fragments migrated in the SDS gel slower than expected based on amino acid sequence, including V5c20.
Spectra of V5c20 (residues 587-725) with and without GB1-tag display a characteristic dip around 200 nm for proteins classified as intrinsically disordered.
Several auxiliary calcium-binding proteins, such as 80K-H protein, calbindin-D28K and calmodulin, were shown to bind in vivo to the C-terminus of TRPV5 and dramatically affect calcium reabsorption in kidney.
The remainder of the peaks belongs to TRPV6 and the linker region (thrombin cleavage site LVPRGS). Lower intensity or absence of the peaks may be indicative of flexibility of the protein. Dispersion of the chemical shifts is quite low as most of the peaks are located in the region of the spectrum characteristic for random coil and alpha-helical proteins (1H chemical shift 7.6–8.2).
Upon addition of calmodulin to V6c7 at 1:1 molar ratio the followings changes were observed: approximately 20 new peaks appeared in the spectrum, several peaks became more intense and spectral dispersion generally increased.
As often observed for intrinsically unstructured proteins, all expressed fragments migrated in the SDS gel slower than expected based on amino acid sequence, including V6c7 (residues 655-725).
TIRAP PBM transitions from a disordered to a helical conformation in the presence of either zwitterionic micelles or monodispersed PIs.
The 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of hLCN2-R-NTD exhibits the distinctive narrow 1HN dispersion of IDPs. Surprisingly, the spectrum also exhibits unusually broad resonances for an IDP, which would indicate that hLCN2-R-NTD, although devoid of any stable secondary or tertiary structures, experiences significant conformational exchange on the micro-to-millisecond timescale.
When performing a 1H,15N HSQC-based titration of 15N-labeled hLCN2-R-NTD with unlabeled NGAL many resonances disappear upon the addition of unlabeled NGAL whereas only very limited chemical shift changes can be observed. This type of signal decrease is often observed in complexes involving one or more disordered partners, hampering the direct characterization of the bound state.
After refolding, the protein is pure, soluble, and appears on the size exclusion chromatography profile to have an hydrodynamic radius consistent with a monomeric intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) of this molecular weight.
To determine whether hLCN2-R-NTD can interact with NGAL, we first used ITC. hLCN2-R-NTD binds to NGAL with an affinity (KD) of 10 μm and a stoichiometry of 1 to 1. Noteworthy, after being loaded with ferric-enterobactin, NGAL is no longer able to interact with hLCN2-R-NTD, suggesting that enterobactin and hLCN2-R-NTD bind to the same site on NGAL.
Here we report (1)H, (15)N, (13)CO, (13)Cα and (13)Cβ NMR chemical shift assignments of the emerin fragment from residue 67 to residue 170, which is sufficient for nuclear localization and involved in lamin A binding. Chemical shift analysis confirms that this fragment is intrinsically disordered in 0 and 8 M urea.
Here again, analysis of the differences between the Cα and Cβ secondary chemical shifts confirms that the emerin fragment is disordered in 8 M urea (Fig. 2d). In this condition no difference value larger than 0.5 ppm is observed, except at residue 167, next to histidine 166; a small variation in pH could explain this difference.
The structure of the N-terminal portion of RAIDD (residues 1–136) containing the CARD was determined using NMR spectroscopy. The terminal residues 1–3 and 95–136 could not be assigned at all, as they appear unstructured and their amide protons exchange rapidly with the solvent.
The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the Bir3 domain (residues 241–356) was well dispersed. he N terminus (residues 241–254) and C terminus (residues 345–356) corresponding to the amino acids outside of the Bir3 domain are disordered.

The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of mSOCS5 175-244 is characteristic of a largely disordered protein, with the amide proton shifts confined to 6.9–8.9 ppm. While IDPs usually have uniformly sharp resonances, these spectra displayed a diversity of peak intensities and peak shapes, indicating conformational heterogeneity. Residues Asp225–Ile233 are helical, while the N-terminal region shows random coil Cα chemical shifts.
The conserved N-terminal region in SOCS5 (SOCS5175-244) facilitates a direct interaction with the kinase domain of JAK and has therefore been designated the JAK interaction region (JIR).The KD for the interaction of SOCS5 JIR with the kinase domain of JAK1 was found to be 0.5 μM.
Using mass spectrometry, we identified Ser211 within the JAK interaction region (JIR) of SOCS5, as a candidate phosphorylation site. A high confidence peptide corresponding to phosphorylated Ser211 was identified with a MaxQuant score of 143.25.

Due to significant sample degradation during purification (Fig. S1), we were not able to isolate a complex consisting of full-length forms of Trf4p and Air2p. We therefore worked with Trf4p/Air2p subcomplexes, where the proteolytically sensitive N and C termini of both proteins were removed.
Colocalization by tethering for increasing the local effective concentrations of Trf4 and Air2, promoting   synergistic binding to Mtr4 (ref. PubMedID: 25175027).
Residues 121–127 interact with Mtr4 DExH-helicase core (ref. PubMed ID: 25175027)

Residues 573-584 bind to NDR1 (ref. PubMedID: 25066235).
Consistent with the in silico prediction, full-length RIN4 circular dichroism spectra displayed a characteristic shape, including low ellipticity at 190 nm and strong negative ellipticity at 200 nm, consistent with an intrinsically disordered protein.
RIN4 is a key accessory protein that associates with the plasma membrane localized NLRs, RPM1, and RPS2. The Arabidopsis protein RIN4 is targeted by multiple bacterial effectors, including HopF2, AvrPto, AvrRpt2, AvrB, and AvrRpm1.
RPM1-INDUCED PROTEIN KINASE (RIPK), a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, phosphorylates RIN4 at three residues: Thr-21, Ser-160, and Thr-166.
In the absence of lipids, rSpTrf-E1 remained intrinsically disordered (~2% α helical) in agreement with a disordered structure in the absence of binding targets.
we investigated possible interactions of rSpTrf-E1 and the recombinant fragments with phospholipids and identified specific binding to phosphatidic acid (PA) by the full-length protein and the rGly-rich and rHis-rich fragments. In addition, the rHis-rich fragment also binds to phosphatidyl inositol 4 phosphate [PtnIns(4)P], although with lower affinity.
The NH resona1H, 13C and 15N resonance assignment of a 114-residue fragment of Engrailed 2 homeoprotein, a partially disordered proteinnces corresponding to homeodomain residues are well dispersed, while those belonging to the N-terminal extension are all in a narrow range between 7.6 and 8.6 ppm, which indicates intrinsic disorder in regions outside the homeodomain.
The weak dispersion in the proton dimension of the (1)H-(15)N HSQC spectrum indicates the presence of disordered regions that do not belong to the homeodomain. This work is a first step toward the NMR investigation of the structure and dynamics of Engrailed 2 protein that contains a well-structured globular domain and partially disordered regions.
The NH resonances corresponding to homeodomain residues are well dispersed, while those belonging to the N-terminal extension are all in a narrow range between 7.6 and 8.6 ppm (see Fig. 1) which indicates intrinsic disorder in regions outside the homeodomain.
This led us to investigate if Engrailed and Foxa2 interact directly. Direct interaction was confirmed by pull-down experiments, and the regions participating in this interaction were identified. In Foxa2 the interacting domain is the Forkhead box DNA-binding domain. In Engrailed, two independent interacting domains exist: the homeodomain and a region that includes the Pbx-binding domain.
As illustrated in Fig. 6B (left panel), fragment 146-199 (containing the Pbx-interacting domain) and the homeodomain bind Foxa2. The 146-199 domain was further sub-divided into fragments 146-167 and 168-199 (the latter containing only the EH2-EH3 Pbx-interacting domain). Fig.6B (right panel) shows that these two sub-fragments still retain Foxa2, although less efficiently than the entire sequence. It can thus be concluded that the homeodomain and a domain N-terminal to the homeodomain, including the Pbx-interacting domain, bind Foxa2
Foxa2 physiologically interacts with Engrailed in regulating the MAP1B promoter ex vivo
At a higher dose (5 μg of plasmid), Foxa2 activates the MAP1B promoter and this activation is partially antagonized by the co-expression of low levels of Engrailed (2μg of plasmid) which have no significant effect per se (Fig.3C). Taken together these results suggest that Foxa2 and Engrailed physically interact and/or compete for overlapping DNA target sequences.
In contrast, the 1H–15N HSQC spectrum of the full-length E7 of HPV45 contained additional signals only in a very narrow chemical shift range, whereas the signals arising from the C-terminus remained virtually unaffected (Figure 2a). Such a spectral ‘fingerprint’ indicates an unstructured and flexible N-terminus (a.a. 1–54) and, importantly so, that the C-terminus of E7 folds autonomously into a well-structured domain
After trypsin digestion, analysis of the main digestion product by mass spectrometry indicated a main product with mass of 26 648 Da corresponding to residues 1−228. Minor processing was observed at residues 217, 218, and 224, indicating a hot spot region consistent with high arginine content. The processed C-terminal sequence includes exon 9 (residues 252−282).
The HSQC spectrum of ZASP-S is indicative of a largely unstructured species with well-folded regions, as shown by the low dispersion of resonances in the center of the spectrum together with the highly dispersed peaks surrounding them. Comparison of the spectrum with that of the isolated PDZ domain shows that the dispersed peaks mostly belong to the PDZ domain (residues 1-84).
Addition of ZASP-S to skeletal muscle G-actin resulted in the formation of F-actin (filaments). The PDZ domain was not required for array formation as ABRΔ10, both WT and mutant, formed similar arrays when mixed with F-actin.
The CD spectrum suggested that ALP107-273 is mostly unfolded. No features characteristic of either α-helical or β-sheet structures were seen.
Size exclusion chromatography showed that ALP107-273 eluted faster than expected based on its calculated monomer molecular weight (18 265 Da).
The 15N-HSQC spectrum measured in normal buffer conditions from uniformly 15N-labeled ALP107-273 was in line with the CD measurements as it showed the collapsed spectrum characteristic of an unfolded protein. When the 13C chemical shift values were compared to those of the random coil conformation, no clear indications of either α helix or β sheet secondary structures were observed.
The NMR titration studies suggested that structure of ALP107-273 was partially stabilized by the interaction with the α-actinin rod region.
To test whether ALP107-273 was functional, we measured the interaction of the purified protein fragment with α-actinin by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). A clear interaction was observed in both experimental setups and the apparent dissociation equilibrium constants (Kd) were in the low micromolar range.
The final NMR model (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 2K2N) is absent the C-terminal 6His tag and the first 30 amino acids, which include the RIT consensus motif present in many members of the PAS-less Cph subfamily.12 Both regions are highly dynamic and largely unstructured, which broadened out most of their NMR signals.
The 15N-1H HSQC spectrum of the 83-residue loop region of kindlin-3 showed limited chemical shift dispersion, ~ 0.8 ppm, of the amide proton resonances, whereas 15N chemical shifts of the amino acids were better dispersed. These spectral features are typically observed for natively unfolded proteins and denatured proteins. The NOE pattern also suggests an absence of stably folded conformations.
NMR 15N-1H HSQC titration experiments were performed to demonstrate residue specific interactions of F1 loop region with liposomes containing zwitterionic lipid POPC, negatively charged lipids POPS or POPG. Membrane specific association of kindlin-3 by its large loop region is a key requirement for the activation of integrins.
UV CD spectra (240–190 nm) of the kindlin-3 loop in detergent free solutions and in solutions containing 50 mM detergents showed a relatively intense band at 208 nm and a less pronounced band around 222–225 nm.
Alone, the spectrum of His-Gβ1-VopR (residues 1–125) chiefly contained peaks that could be attributed to the N-terminal Gβ1 domain; most of the remaining peaks originating from VopR 1–125 had heterogenous line widths and poor 1H chemical shift dispersion, consistent with unfolding.
These results indicated that the BPDVopR is unstructured in solution without a phosphoinositide ligand, but that specific binding of PIP2 induces its folding. Further analysis using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy revealed a PIP2-dependent increase in secondary structure within His-Gβ1-VopR1–125, corroborating these findings.

The secondary structure of MpASR was revealed by CD spectroscopy. The far-UV CD spectrum of recombinant MpASR has a maximum negative ellipticity at 200.8 nm and low ellipticity around 215–229 nm , which indicates a disordered protein structure.
By SDS–PAGE analysis, MpASR showed a characteristic low mobility. The predicted molecular mass of MpASR is 16.2 kDa, but it ran at 22 kDa. This high apparent molecular mass is caused by a highly hydrophilic property which is often characteristic of IDPs.
MpASR proteins were heat stable, suggesting that compared with globular proteins such as BSA, MpASR is not likely to collapse and aggregate during high temperature treatment or boiling.
Incubation of recombinant MpASR with 200 ng trypsin for 1 h resulted in a large amount of low molecular weight proteolytic products.
In the presence of Zn2+, MpASR was less susceptible to proteolysis in a zinc concentration-dependent manner.
Desiccation and zinc binding can induce structure and homodimerization in ASR1 protein. ASR1 protein also possess zinc-dependent DNA-binding activity. In the presence of Zn2+, MpASR was less susceptible to proteolysis in a zinc concentration-dependent manner.
By comparing the experimentally determined Stokes radius (RS obs) of HvASR1 and TtASR1 with the Stokes radii expected for various conformational states (native, molten globule, pre-molten globule, and denaturant-unfolded), the two proteins were found to have an RS higher than the value expected for a monomeric, natively folded form (~20 Å) (Table 2).
As shown in Supplementary Fig. S4, the experimentally observed profiles for HvASR1 and TtASR1 are consistent with lack of a stable 3D structure, as judged from their rather high basal fluorescence at 20 °C and from the flatness of their profile.
Both HvASR1 and TtASR1 exhibit an abnormally slow migration in SDS-PAGE, with an apparent molecular mass (MM) comprised between 20 and 25 kDa (expected MM ~16 kDa) (Fig. 2).
The aberrant electrophoretic migration of HvASR1 and TtASR1 proteins constitutes the first experimental hint of their disordered nature.
The experimental Rg values are therefore in very good agreement with the expected Rg values using parameters inferred from IDPs, while they are three times smaller that those expected for fully unfolded forms.
Under native conditions and neutral pH, both proteins present spectra typical of proteins lacking any stable organized secondary structure, as judged from their large negative ellipticity at 200 nm, low amplitude in the 210–230 nm region, and low ellipticity at 190 nm (Fig. 5A). Spectral deconvolution revealed a high content (>60%) of unordered structure in both ASR1 proteins (see insets in Fig. 5A).
We then recorded the far-UV CD spectra in the presence of zinc (Fig. 10). The addition of 2.5 mM ZnSO4 does not trigger a gain in α-helical structure, but rather, leads to a decrease in the amplitude of the negative peak at 200 nm, consistent with a decrease in disorder content.
By combining 10% TFE and 2 mM ZnSO4, a much more pronounced gain of structure is observed (Fig. 10), resulting in an increase in α-helical content, as judged from the appearance of the characteristic double minima at 208 and 222 nm (Fig. 10).
In the absence of TFE, the two proteins are readily degraded after an incubation as short as one hour, and entirely digested after 6 hours (Fig. 8), a behavior that is consistent with an overall high solvent accessibility and disordered nature.
Near-UV CD studies further support this conclusion (Supplementary Text 5). For both proteins, the addition of 2 mM ZnSO4 results in a spectral modification, consistent with the gain of some tertiary structure (Fig. 5D).

Both proteins reached their maximum exchange after 10 sec of labeling, indicating that HvASR1 and TtASR1 are predominantly unfolded in their native state.
Both ASR1 proteins are intrinsically disordered in their native state.
The addition of 2 mM ZnSO4 induced a weak dynamic HDX-MS behavior, indicative of structure formation, throughout the entire polypeptide chain of both proteins (Panels C, Fig. 11). Notably, the addition of both 10% TFE and 2 mM ZnSO4 in a combined fashion resulted in an more pronounced change in magnitude of HDX dynamics (Panels D, Fig. 11).

We first recorded the fluorescence emission spectra of the proteins either in the presence or absence of increasing zinc concentrations (Fig. 9). As expected for Tyr-containing proteins, both ASR1 proteins exhibit a maximum close to 303 nm. Interestingly, the intensity of the emission peak is gradually quenched with increasing zinc concentration, reflecting a decrease in the solvent exposure of Tyr residues. This behavior is indicative of a zinc-induced gain of tertiary structure.

The residues outside the structured DNA binding domain (residues 100−180) all showed random coil chemical shifts and very narrow resonance lines resulting in severe resonance overlap in some spectral regions. Nevertheless, complete backbone resonance assignments were obtained for nearly all residues, and side chain resonance assignments were more than 96% complete for residues 95−181.
Non-specific contacts involving this segment are important for DNA binding affinity of FOXO4 (ref.  PubMed ID: 17244620).

While the addition of Zn2+ and 10% TFE does not promote an additional gain in α-helicity in HvASR1 (Fig. 10A), the reverse is observed for TtASR1, where the effects appear cumulative (Fig. 10B).

Near-UV CD studies further support this conclusion (Supplementary Text 5). For both proteins, the addition of 2 mM ZnSO4 results in a spectral modification, consistent with the gain of some tertiary structure (Fig. 5D). In particular, a peak between 275 and 282 nm, which corresponds to Tyr residues60, becomes discernible, reflecting a conformational change in the environment of Tyr residues (Fig. 5D).

In addition, NMR analysis of MUC1-CD confirmed the absence of a detectable secondary structure (Fig 1B–1D), as shown by the presence of the peaks between 7.5 and 8.5 ppm, consistent with MUC1-CD being an unstructured protein.
The double mutant chimera AQA+Y20N had reduced endocytosis and recycling rates and accumulated in EGFP-Rab11-positive endosomes, indicating that palmitoylation is the dominant feature modulating MUC1 recycling from endosomes back to the plasma membrane.
Palmitoylation of transmembrane proteins can affect their membrane trafficking, and the MUC1 sequence CQC3RRK at the boundary of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains mimics reported site(s) of S-palmitoylation.

Addition of increasing concentration of TFE showed progressive folding and increase in regularity by stimulating formation of α-helical secondary structure. Disordered region in SpEAF(158–251aa) decreased from 99% in absence of TFE to 31% in presence of 0.5% TFE
Fluorescence spectra of Mcl-1 and PUMA peptide show Mcl-1 is folded,
PUMA is unfolded and binding occurs.
From the CD spectrum, it can be calculated that the PUMA peptide has ∼20% residual helicity in the unbound state (in 50 mM PO4, pH 7.0, 25 °C),24 consistent with the high predicted helicity of the BH3 region in the context of the full-length PUMA protein (Figure ​(Figure1B).

The isolated R6BD peptide forms loosely folded helices in solution. (Supplementary Figure S3C.)

Rad18 recognizes Rad6 via an N-terminal RING domain and a separate C-terminal Rad6 binding domain (R6BD).
The R6BD adopts the more compact structure upon complex formation.
N- and C- terminal limits were determined and the minimal chymotryptic FHA fragment (residues 64–219) was purified. For crystallization, the phosphopeptide RHFDpTYLIRR was mixed with the Chk2 FHA fragment in a 1.5:1 stoichiometric excess. Maps were readily interpretable, allowing a model consisting of residues 91–207.
Among the seven SQ or TQ amino acid pairs, Thr68 is the predominant target of ATM; a prerequisite for subsequent autophosphorylation on Thr383 and Thr 387.
Limited proteolysis of full-length CHK2K249R indicated that the ~70 N-terminal residues containing the SCD and the ~30 C-terminal residues are highly susceptible to digestion, suggesting that they are unstructured or loosely folded (data not shown).
The SCD consists of multiple SQ/TQ (Ser-Gln/Thr-Gln) motifs that are characteristic of ATM phosphorylation sites, with Thr68 being the primary site that gets phosphorylated in response to DNA damage.
Dimerization requires the interaction of the phosphorylated Thr68-containing SCD segment of one
CHK2 molecule with the FHA domain of a second molecule.
P1 crystals of CHK2 K249R (residues 70–512) were grown. The P1 form contains four dimers in the asymmetric unit. The refined model of four dimers encompasses residues 92–501 of each CHK2.
The P1 form contains four dimers in the asymmetric unit. The refined model of four dimers encompasses residues 92–501 of each CHK2, with residues 228–232, 254–267, 383–387, and 398–401 disordered.

The refined model of four dimers encompasses residues 92–501 of each CHK2, with residues 228–232, 254–267, 383–387, and 398–401 disordered. One protomer in each of the four dimers has additional disorder in the activation loop (370–382).
The activation loop (residues 371–391) contains the activating phosphorylation site.
The activation loop (residues 371–391) forms part of the polypeptide substrate-binding site.
The activation loop (residues 371–391)  has the inactive conformation. This conformation starts with a short a helix
(alphaT1, residues 369–376) followed by a twelve-residue disordered segment (residues 377–388), both aspects typical of the inactive kinase conformation.

The purified Chk2(210-531) protein crystallised as a binary complex with Mg-ADP. Electron density is seen for residues 210–504 of the molecule, except for the loop comprised of residues 255–268 (connecting strand β3 to helix αC), which appears to be poorly ordered in these crystals. Similarly, at the C-terminus residues 505–531 have no discernable electron density and are also considered to be disordered.

The amino acid specific backbone dihedral angle distributions determined from the ensemble selections (Figure S1) show that negligible secondary structure is present.
All results indicate that functional elastin is highly disordered.
However, the moderate NOE signal intensities, in combination with the chemical-shift data, indicate that these regions are predominantly unstructured in nature, which suggests either a pliable structure or exchange between the random-coil and more ordered structures. Also upon interaction with VP16ad, we did not observe significant changes in NOE contacts for PC4ntd, which suggest that PC4ntd is highly flexible and mostly unstructured both in the free form and in the complex with the activator.
Remarkably, the presence of PC4ntd can either be stimulatory (VP16 interaction), neutral (dsDNA), or inhibitory (ssDNA) on the PC4ctd functions. The apparent Kd values at room temperature for the interaction with PC4 and PC4ctd, respectively, are 391 ± 80 and 991 ± 195 nM for VP16ad, 55 ± 33 and 41 ± 21 nM for dsDNA, and 25 ± 4 nM and 0.98 ± 0.23 nM for ssDNA.

The modulatory role for PC4ntd, as observed for the other interactions, is underscored by the small increase in unwinding activity upon the mutation of the lysine residues within the amino-terminal domain and reflects the higher unwinding activity of PC4ctd in comparison with full-length PC4.
We carried out limited proteolysis experiments with trypsin and V8 protease. Facts suggest that the C-terminal half of Pex19p is a relatively stable domain. On the other hand, the N-terminal half of Pex19p was susceptible to proteolytic degradation, which suggests that it has a flexible conformation.
We performed cell-free translation assays for each half as well as the full-length protein. Pex19p(N-half) bound to Pex3p-(34–373). Binding of Pex19p to PMP22, PMP70, and Pex16p requires more than the C-terminal half-sized domain of Pex19p.
His10-Pex19p(N-half) displayed little secondary structure; its α-helix content was estimated as 6%. The additive spectrum of His10-Pex19p(N-half) plus Pex19p(C-half) almost coincided with that of the full-length His10-Pex19p. Therefore, we conclude that both halves of Pex19p maintain their respective three-dimensional structures as in the corresponding regions of the full-length His10-Pex19p.

All PEX19 peptides from the N-terminal region A4 - L182, as well as the C-terminal end F278 - L297 were already fully deuterated after 30 seconds incubation in D2O (Figure 3A and Figure S1) indicating that these areas, consisting of two thirds of the protein, are highly solvent exposed and structurally disordered

The 13Cα chemical-shift index (Supplementary Fig. 2b), an indicator of secondary structure27, confirmed that preS1 had only short segments of partially populated α-helical or extended structure. Thus, the 108-residue preS1 domain is an IDP
We report here atomic-resolution descriptions of the binding thermodynamics and structural biology of the interaction between preS1 and the EAR domain of g2-adaptin. NMR, protein engineering, X-ray crystallography and MS showed that preS1 contains multiple g2-EAR–binding motifs that mimic the membrane-trafficking motifs (and binding modes) of host proteins.
The CD analysis showed that the purified preS1, which was largely unstructured in aqueous solution, acquired a significant (16%) alpha-helical structure when analyzed in 50% trifluoroethanol or 20 mM SDS. The results suggest that the preS1 assumes a mainly unstructured conformation and may form induced secondary structures upon binding to target proteins or under hydrophobic environment.
The spectrum shows narrow chemical-shift dispersion in both dimensions, indicating that it is largely unstructured with no tertiary structure under a nondenaturing experimental condition.
IL-6 and Not IL-6R Carries the Binding Site for the preS(21-47)
Segment of the HBV env Protein.
This search revealed that interleukin 6 contains recognition sites for the preS(21-47) sequence and mediates HBV-cell interactions. Thus, HBV belongs to a group of viruses utilizing cytokines or cytokine receptors for replication and interference with the host immune system.
The most prominent pre-structured region encompasses
residues 27–45 and contains two helical turn motifs
(black bars in Fig. 6) composed of residues Pro 32 –Ala 36
and Pro 41 –Phe 45 , both of which are located within the
putative HBD (residues 21–47) proposed by other techniques.
Location of pre-structured regions (this work) and previously suggested functional domains in preS1. Pre-structured regions
are shown above the amino acid sequence of preS1 N-terminal 60 residues and are indicated by black, gray, or hatched bars. The most
prominently pre-structured region is formed by residues 27–45.
The crystal structure of POLD2 (p50) and N-terminal domain of POLD3 (p66N) has been solved.
"The density was not observed for the total of 56 residues, including p50 amino acid residues 42–53, 102–122, 251–253, 382–387 and 466–469."
"each molecule contained all amino acid residues of p66N and p50, except disordered regions in four loops and the C-terminal tail of p50."

"each molecule contained all amino acid residues of p66N and p50, except disordered regions in four loops and the C-terminal tail of p50."
the region encompassing residues 90–120 exhibitsincreased backbone flexibility as evidenced by both decreasedR2values and more negative heteronuclear NOEs.
Concluding, the PRE (paramagnetic relaxation enhancement) data indicate that the central segment (residues 90–150) of OPN expands upon heparin binding, comparable to an “unfolding-upon-binding”event.
"Recombinant PRC2 was much less prone to aggregation when EZH2 was expressed in two parts (EZH2N 1–385 and EZH2C 421–746), removing the linker between the end of MCSS and the beginning of SANT2, thus 28 residues are missing from the middle lobe as indicated in Fig. 1d"
This region are missing in two different x-ray experiments
This region are missing in two different x-ray experiments
"In the inhibitor complex beyond residue Ser729, the C-terminus is disordered."
"However, the 17 C-terminal residues including most of the post-SET domain were not observed"
This region are missing in two different x-ray experiments.
"The final model consisted of one EZH2-SET domain (chain A) containing a total of 209 residues, 6 zinc atoms, 159 water molecules, and 1 sulfate ion. 96.6% of residues are in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot, and 100% are in the allowed region. The C-terminal residues 737-751 are disordered"
"In the isolated structure, residues 727–729 partially fold into the substrate-binding channel and thereafter the chain is disordered"
"Some residues are not visible in the electron density map and assumed to be disordered. These include residues ...... residues 422-469, 751-757 and 795-796 in chains H, I and J, respectively, and residue 794 in chain I"
"No ordered electron density was present for residues 5–24 and 55–79 of Pat1, consistent with the results from the binding assays"

cE5 displayed a typical circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of an unstructured protein, with a minimum at 202 nm (Fig. 2)
The 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of 15N- labeled cE5 showed a limited chemical shift range (Fig. 3A), indicative of an unfolded molecule having few secondary structure elements, consistent with the random-coil state suggested by CD data.
No significant density was present for the N-terminal tetrapeptide cE5(Asp-31) to cE5(Glu-34) or for the C-terminal 21 amino acids (cE5(Ser-64) to cE5(Glu-82) of the P5 fragment...
...complex A comprising thrombin residues T(Ser-1E) to T(Arg-15) and T(Ile-16) to T(Gly-246) and inhibitor residues cE5(Glu-35) to cE5(Asn-63)...
In agreement with the results of CD (Fig. 2) and NMR measurements (Fig. 3), the inhibitor adopts a mostly extended conformation, running in a reverse orientation to substrates on the surface of thrombin and interacting with both the exosite I and the active-site region of the proteinase (Fig. 7, A, C, and D).
...the cE5 fragment spanning residues cE5(Glu-35) to cE5(Asp-47) blocks the exosite I of the proteinase (Figs. 4 and 7C).
Overall, the cE5 central region represented by the P2 peptide appeared as the main responsible for both thrombin binding and inhibition.
CD spectra of s-variegin, EP25, and AP18 are all similar to that of n-variegin, typical of random-coil proteins (supplemental Fig. S2).
CD spectra of s-variegin, EP25, and AP18 are all similar to that of n-variegin, typical of random-coil proteins (supplemental Fig. S2).
To investigate how the cleavage affects the activity, MH22, s- variegin, and hirulog-1 were preincubated with thrombin for different lengths of time before determination of their residual thrombin inhibitory activities (Table 1 and Figure 2A).
CD spectra of s-variegin, EP25, and AP18 are all similar to that of n-variegin, typical of random-coil proteins (supplemental Fig. S2).
Only 17 out of the 32 residues (VHis12 to VLeu28) of s-variegin have well-defined density (Figure 1C).
In contrast, the C-terminal fragment MH22 V(11MHKTAPPFDFEAIPEEYLDDES32) remains bound to thrombin after cleavage.
Only 17 out of the 32 residues (VHis12 to VLeu28) of s-variegin have well-defined density (Figure 1C).
s-Variegin fits firmly into the canyon-like cleft extending from the thrombin active site to exosite-I.
Thus, we built 2 segments of the peptide, representing the active site binding region N terminus to the scissile bond A(5QTAVPK10) and exosite-I binding region A(19DFEEIPSDEI28) (Fig. 5A, B).
These were assigned to the C-terminus, and their elevated transverse 15N relaxation times, as evidenced by narrow line widths, indicate that the C-terminal region (after K53) is highly disordered and dynamic on a pico- to nanosecond timescale.
"In the KRIT1-ICAP1 co-crystal structure the ICAP1 construct spans residues 49 to 200 but the first residue visible in all copies of the asymmetric unit is C60-ICAP and the final well-ordered residue is Ser193-ICAP. "
The crystal structure of  ICAP1(residues 49–200)–KRIT1(residues 170–198) has been solved. The first residue visible in the structure is C60.
This includes residues 3-722 with the exception of a surface loop from 300 to 310 for which the electron density is weak and essentially uninterpretable
"The N terminus is unstructured. "
"Two features are immediately obvious from the data: first, signal attenuations are very small for the N-terminal, unstructured segment. "
The low sequence complexity of the prolinerich segment and its sensitivity to proteolysis suggest that this region is largely unstructured and forms a flexible linker to the terminal a-solenoid and that the 55K region projects in toward the membrane to engage Sec23/24 (via a portion of the proline-rich segment)
The C terminus of αIIb (R997-E1008) is rich in acidic residues and largely unstructured, as was observed previously
In aqueous solution, the αIIb and β3 tails are largely unstructured, although part of the β3 tail has a propensity to form a helix (residues Arg724−Ala735) and part (the NPLY motif) has a tendency to form a β-turn.
"In aqueous solution, the alphaIIb and beta3 tails are largely unstructured."
However, its C-terminal A737–T762 is disordered, consistent with the secondary structure analysis.
Here we report the crystal structure of the principal integrin binding and activating fragment of talin, alone and in complex with fragments of the beta 3 integrin tail.
Here we present the detailed structural analysis of Shc phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain in complex with the bi-phosphorylated β(3)integrin cytoplasmic tail (CT).
Here, we report the structure of the cytoplasmic domain of human integrin αIIbβ3 bound to its inhibitor, the immunoglobin repeat 21 of filamin A (FLNa-Ig21).
In this paper we demonstrate that the beta 3 subunit of alpha IIb beta 3 was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.
However, the presence of phosphate on this threonine inhibited the binding of Shc to tyrosyl-phosphorylated β3 peptide.
Interestingly, alpha(nu)beta(3) was also found to directly interact with RPTPbeta/zeta, and PTN-induced Y773 phosphorylation of beta(3) integrin was dependent on both RPTPbeta/zeta and the downstream c-src kinase activation.
Furthermore, we validated that an LC3-interacting region (LIR) in integrin β3 bound to the ATG8 domains of the autophagy receptors MAP1LC3 and GABARAP in a manner enhanced by LIR-adjacent phosphorylation.
The integrin β3 tail contains a phospho-regulated LIR motif

In dilute aqueous solution, the N terminus is unstructured, but in nonpolar, membrane-like environments, this helical structure is quite stable.
"a long, disordered loop between residues 111 to 143
The residues 1–12 upstream of helix 1 were disordered in the structures of FKBP51(1–140), consistent with the poor sequence conservation in this segment.
Both of them are extended, but the peptide does not form a β-strand in the 14-3-3 complex as seen in the filamin complex. This indicates that the integrin cytoplasmic tail can adopt different conformations depending of its binding partner. In the crystal structures, we see only those parts of the cytoplasmic tail peptides that are in direct contacts, whereas the other regions apparently are disordered.
The β2 peptide bound to IgFLNa21 in a very similar way as the β7 peptide,3 forming a hydrogen-bonded β-strand next to the strand C of IgFLNa21 and interacting hydrophobically with the side chains of strand D (Figure 3C,D)
Our results suggest that the phosphorylation of beta2 integrins on Thr758 acts as a molecular switch to inhibit filamin binding and allow 14-3-3 protein binding to the integrin cytoplasmic domain, thereby modulating T-cell adhesion.

The IBR-R2 linker region (which we refer to as the tether: residues 378–414) is 37 residues long. Most of the beginning of the tether (14 residues) is disordered, while the latter part runs across the surface of R1

The repressing REP is surrounded by unstructured regions
The long linker following the Ubl is not visible in the crystal structure.
In the new structure, residues 382–391 preceding the REP are again disordered
Although the phosphopeptide consists of 18 residues, only the C-terminal eight have clear electron density in the structure and bury ~430 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface of the cSH2 domain upon complex formation. The remainder of the peptide is presumably disordered and not required for complex formation.
In agreement with what was previously observed with the N-terminal domain of colicin N (42), the far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of ATh shows no significant amount of ordered secondary structure (Figure 4) and was similar to that of AT1
Even though 107 amino acids of the translocation domain of ColA were included in the crystallization, only residues 9–20 could be resolved in the electron density maps (Fig. 3A). No additional peaks of density were observed at any stage of the model building and refinement, therefore the remaining residues of the TA1–107 polypeptide are assumed to be disordered in the solvent channels within the crystal lattice.
The HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled ATh result in a significant amount of poorly dispersed signals superimposing in the middle of the spectra (Figure 5), confirming this lack of structure, which is in agreement with the CD data.
The  HSQC  spectrum  of 15N-labeled  TolAIII3  is significantly altered after addition of unlabeled ATh.
Here  we  show  that  in  vitro  the  translocation  domain  of colicin  A  has  a  strongly  perturbing  effect  on  the  tertiary structure of TolAIII, and thus presumably also on the whole Tol-Pal system within the periplasm of E. coli.
Purified TolAIII2 and TolAIII3 were analyzed by a Western blot and dot blot, which were incubated with 200 nM ATh followed by immunodetection with 1C11 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the colicin domain. Under these conditions, the ATh protein was found to recognize TolAIII2 and TolAIII3.
Immunoprecipitation experiments using mAb 1C11, which recognizes an epitope located within the N-terminal sequenceof ATh, were also checked with ATh and TolAIII derivative mixtures.  Coomassie  blue-stained  SDS-PAGE  analyses indicated that TolAIII2 and TolAIII3 co-immunoprecipitate with ATh
SDS-PAGE shift experiments(30) were performed with the purified ATh and TolAIII3. A TolAIII3-ATh protein complex could be clearly detected having a relative electrophoretic mobility corresponding to a heterodimer, while this complex slightly dissociated into monomeric forms upon migration (Figure 6).
Gel  filtration  experiments  using  ATh,  TolAIII3,  and TolAIII3 with ATh, loaded at the same concentration and in the same buffer used for NMR interaction analyses, further indicated the formation of a heterodimer.
Structure of the TA1–107–TolB complex at 2.6 Å resolution showing the colicin binding site of the β-propeller domain.
Prior to their action, the import of colicins is mediated by their binding to specific receptors of the outer membrane, and their translocation through the cell envelope which requires either the Tol-Pal system (group A colicins) or the TonB system(group B colicins) (15). The three-dimensional structure of several of these toxins shows a similar type of organization(16-19). It comprises three distinct domains:  the N-terminal domain   involved   in   the   translocation   across   the   outer membrane, the central domain or receptor binding domain,and  the  C-terminal  domain  that  is  responsible  for  lethal activity. Membrane fractionation shows that the Tol proteins form a complex with imported colicin A (20) and that, during pore formation, colicin A retains interactions with its receptor and the Tol machinery (21).

The structural properties of Nogo‐A(567–748) were first investigated by CD spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3A, the CD spectrum of Nogo‐A(567–748) in aqueous buffer had a maximal negative peak at ≈202 nm and had no significant positive signal at 198 nm, indicating that the polypeptide was not fully structured [[23]]. However, the existence of the maximal negative signal at around 202 nm, rather than 198 nm, together with the negative shoulder signal at ≈225 nm, indicated that the polypeptide was also not assuming a ‘random coil’ structure.
Similarly, Nogo-33 identical for all three Nogo proteinswas predicated [Fig. 2(a)] and subsequently experimentally shown to be highly disordered as judged from its far-UV CD [Fig. 4(a)] and narrowly-dispersed HSQC spectrum (only 0.5 ppm over 1H and 19 ppm over 15N dimensions) [Fig. 4(b)].
NMR spectroscopy was further utilized to explore the structural properties of Nogo‐40. The very narrow resonance dispersion of amide protons (≈0.7p.p.m) and the lack of side‐chain packing with aromatic ring protons in aqueous buffer (Fig. 5C) demonstrate that Nogo‐40 in aqueous buffer had no stable structure, which is consistent with the CD results above. 
Similarly, Nogo-33 identical for all three Nogo proteinswas predicated [Fig. 2(a)] and subsequently experimentally shown to be highly disordered as judged from its far-UV CD [Fig. 4(a)] and narrowly-dispersed HSQC spectrum (only 0.5 ppm over 1H and 19 ppm over 15N dimensions) [Fig. 4(b)].
Unfortunately we found that the first 31 residues were amenable to cellular proteolysis which made it very difficult to obtain the entire Nogo-B (1–200). This observation suggests that Nogo-B is highly disordered because disordered proteins have been extensively found to be very sensitive to proteolytic digestion.
As seen in Fig. 3(a), Nogo-B (1–200) and Nogo-B (32–200) owned very similar far-UV CD spectra with a negative signal at198 nm and without any positive signal at190 nm. This observation clearly indicated that both Nogo-B (1–200) and Nogo-B (32–200) were lacking predominant secondary structures in solution
We then recorded the near-UV CD spectra of Nogo-B (32–200) in the absence and presence of 8M denaturant urea [Fig. 3(b)]. The high similarity between two near-UV spectra suggested that the N-terminus of Nogo-B had no tight tertiary packing even under the native condition.
Completely consistent with CD results, 1H15N NMR HSQC spectra of both Nogo-B (1–200) and Nogo-B (32–200) were very similar, with very narrow spectral dispersions over both dimensions (1 ppm over 1H and 20ppm over 15N dimensions) [Fig. 3(c)]. Moreover, no significant change in the spectral dispersion and peak numberswere observed for 1H15N NMR HSQC spectra of Nogo-B(32–200) in the absence and in presence of 8Murea [Fig.3(d)]. These results provided the strongest evidence that both Nogo-B (1–200) and Nogo-B (32–200) were highly disordered with no tight tertiary packing.
Hydrogen exchange experiment offers a very sensitiveprobe to detect tertiary packing property. When the 15N-labeled Nogo-B (32–200) was lyophilized and redissolved in 100% D2O, all HSQC peaks disappeared withinthe experimental dead time (spectrum not shown). This result again indicated that Nogo-B (32–200) was highly flexible in solution and all of its amide protons were openly accessible to the bulk solvent.
Consequently, we dissected Nogo-A (201–1016) into two sets of overlapped fragments,with each set having four 200 residue fragments as the size of autonomous protein folding domains usually ranges from120 to 200 residues. The two sets of dissected Nogo-A fragments P1-P8 were successfully expressed and purified by HPLC. Very interestingly, the apparent molecular weights of all eight fragments as estimated from SDS-PAGE were 1.5 times larger than those calculated from their sequences. Moreover, the same phenomenon was observed for Nogo-B (1–200) and Nogo-B (32–200). This observation could serve as evidence that these Nogo fragments are intrinsically unstructured because previously this abnormal behavior on SDS-PAGE was proposed as anindicator of intrinsically unstructured proteins.

Figure 5 shows the far-UV CD and HSQC spectra of the first set of four fragments P1-P4 spanning over the Nogo-A residues 201–1016. Similar to those observed for Nogo-B, all four fragments had far-UV CD spectra typical of disordered proteins and their HSQC spectra showed sharp resonance peaks distributed within very narrow spectral dispersions. Therefore the results indicated that this set of fragments owned no populated secondary structures and tight tertiary packing. Moreover, the second group of the fragments P5-P8 dissected in a very different way also gave rise to far-UV CD and HSQC spectra characteristic of disordered proteins (Fig. 6), again indicating that the second group of fragments were also largely disordered.

To explore whether Nogo‐A(567–748) had any specific interaction with metal ions, we utilized CD measurements to monitor conformational changes induced by the addition of metal ions, including Ca2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Ni2+ and Zn2+. Only Zn2+ was able to induce a significant conformational change in the polypeptide. As shown in Fig. 3A, the CD spectrum of Nogo‐A(567–748) with dual negative signals at ≈206 and 221nm in the presence of 4mm Zn2+ resembles that for a typical helical protein. The results indicate that Zn2+ could specifically induce, to a significant degree, the polypeptide to assume a helical conformation.

The results indicate that Zn2+ could specifically induce, to a significant degree, the polypeptide to assume a helical conformation.
Interestingly, upon addition of 4mm Zn2+, no new HSQC peaks appeared but the intensities of the existing peaks became stronger (spectrum not shown). This observation suggests that although the introduction of Zn2+ was able to significantly enhance the helical structure of Nogo‐A(567–748) as detected by CD, it was not sufficient to make the tertiary packing as tight as those found in a well‐structured protein. 
As shown in Fig. 3B, the poor chemical dispersions of the spectrum at both 1H and 15N dimensions indicated that Nogo‐A(567–748) did not have a tight side‐chain packing. In particular, the number of observed NMR cross peaks was only about 35, much less than expected for a 182 residue protein, thus indicating that slow conformational exchanges existed over most regions of the protein. Usually, slow conformational exchange would result in significant line‐broadening for HSQC peaks and make these peaks undetectable. The manifested HSQC peaks in Fig. 3B most likely resulted from the unstructured and flexible regions of the Nogo‐A(567–748), while the peaks for the regions undergoing slow conformational changes were undetectable. The results above indicated that Nogo‐A(567–748) was partially structured, probably with some properties characteristic of molten globule states [[24-27]].
The CD spectrum of Nogo‐40 in the aqueous buffer has a negative peak at ≈198nm, indicating that Nogo‐40 had no stable conformation in aqueous buffer [[23]]. Interestingly, with the introduction of methanol, the CD spectra of Nogo‐40 undergo dramatic changes. The CD spectra of Nogo‐40 in the presence of methanol at a concentration of 74% or above show one positive peak at ≈198nm and two negative peaks at ≈208 and 222nm, respectively. This observation clearly indicates that Nogo‐40 adopts a well‐formed helical conformation in the presence of 74% or higher percentages of methanol. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 5B, TFE is also able to stabilize the helical conformation of Nogo‐40. It appears that 50% TFE is sufficient to stabilize a full helical conformation for the peptide.
The backbone resonances for residues Val102 to Glu117 have very narrow linewidths, suggesting considerable flexibility in this C-terminal region and facilitating assignment through strong dαN connectivities, characteristic of
an extended conformation.
This region was not included in the isolated crystal structure of the U1-A N-terminal RRM-SL2 complex (Oubridge et al, 1994) and was disordered in the absence of RNA in an NMR-structure of a U1-A fragment spanning residues 1–117 (Avis et al, 1996), demonstrating that its fold is induced on RNA binding.
a second RRM at the C terminus of the U1-A protein (residues 208–282), which is connected to the N-terminal RRM by a flexible linker (residues 115–207)
a second RRM at the C terminus of the U1-A protein (residues 208–282), which is connected to the N-terminal RRM by a flexible linker (residues 115–207)
The   N terminus  (residues  2  to  7)  and  the  C  terminus (residues 99 to 117) are poorly ordered and show no long-range  NOE  connectivity  to  the  rest  of  the protein
The backbone resonances for  residues  Val102  to  Glu117  have  very  narrow line widths,   suggesting   considerable   flexibility   in this  C-terminal  region
A  key  new  feature  of  the  presently  determined solution structure of U1A117 is the presence of an additional  helix  C-terminal  to  the  RNP  domain  as conventionally   defined,   running   from   Asn90   to Lys98 (helix C)
Although  helix  C  may  stabilise  the  structure  of the free protein, its orientation in the free U1A117 fragment   covers   part   of   the   RNA-binding   site defined by the crystal structure of the U1A98/RNAcomplex
The CD spectrum of the hydrated protein indicated a low content of stable secondary structures, with a well defined minimal ellipticity around 200 nm
The minimum at 1642 cm− 1 indicating unstructured elements in the protein is the most prominent. This is in good agreement with the CD spectra, which also indicate that the unstructured components of LEA7 dominate in its hydrated state.
The CD spectrum of the protein in aqueous solution appeared typical of a random coil structure, with a 195-nm minimum of ellipticity. LEAM is thus a monomer that is natively unfolded in solution
In solution, the LEAM spectra revealed a maximum at 1649 cm−1, with a main peak at 1647.5 cm−1 surrounded by two other peaks at 1663 and 1630 cm−1. These values were assigned to random coil structures according to published data and in light of the CD observations
The embryo-specific EMB-1 protein of Daucus carota is flexible and unstructured in solution
The NMR results reveal poor chemical shift dispersion, rapid chemical exchange of the amide backbone protons, unexpectedly narrow linewidths and the general absence of nuclear Overhauser effects. Together, these results indicate the EMB-1 protein has no defined secondary or tertiary structure in solution and the polypeptide backbone of the EMB-1 protein is flexible on a sub-nanosecond time scale.
In the spectrum of EMB-1 (Fig. 4a), the alpha proton resonances, aromatic proton resonances of the tyr and phe residues, and the methyl proton resonances of the val, leu and ile residues are found at chemical shift positions characteristic of a random coil structure (i.e., about 7 ppm, 4 ppm, and 1 - 1.5 ppm, respectively) [16] and exhibit low chemical shift dispersion. These data indicate the absence of secondary or environmental-dependent chemical shifts and hence the absence of ordered structure of EMB-1 in aqueous solution. 
In EMB-1, amide proton exchange is rapid, indicating the absence of a stably-folded structure (Fig. 4a).
What was observed were CD spectra consistent with a random coil structure and minimal α-helix or β sheet, which is demonstrated by the lack of negative peaks at 222 nm for α-helices and 215 nm for β-sheets
The results suggest that under all measured conditions, HK5 has little secondary structure (Fig. 2), as exhibited by the lack of distinct peaks and the small 1H and 15N chemical shift ranges. Titration of Zn2+, Co2+, or Fe2+ up to 400 μM, did not induce any additional secondary structure. Taken together, these data suggest HK5 is likely an intrinsically unstructured protein.
Here we demonstrate that HK5 is an intrinsically unstructured protein (IUP) and binds to ferritin in a metal-mediated interaction that occurs on the surface of ferritin and works independently of oxidized iron in its ferrihydrite core.
To test whether HK5 had a preference for interacting with one of the subunits in vitro, binding affinity for HK5 and ferritin H or ferritin L were measured individually. In the absence of metal ions, HK5 has similar binding affinities to ferritin L and ferritin H, with Kd values of 247 µM and 129 µM, respectively.
Circular dichroism (CD) was used to investigate the secondary structural organization of the SF3b155r domain. The pronounced negative band just below 200 nm of the SF3b155r CD spectrum is characteristic of a protein that is in a largely unstructured conformation.
Using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy, they showed that U2AF65 binds five of the seven tryptophan-containing SF3b155 sites. Molecular models and sequence similarities suggested that formation of the SF3b155/U2AF65 complex would depend on the SF3b155 tryptophans and preceding basic residues in a similar manner to the SF1p/U2AF65-UHM complex.
In the absence of DNA, BrkDBD is unfolded at 25 °C. Equimolar addition of omb12 DNA induces the same spectral changes as for the C-terminal part of the longer BrkNter construct.
In contrast, addition of an equimolar amount of omb12 DNA (which corresponds in sequence to an in vivo binding site of Brk6) induces a drastic change in the 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum.
DNA binding induces partial folding of BrkNter.
The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of BrkNter in the absence of DNA at 25 °C indicates that the respective amino acid residues are in random coil conformation and therefore that apo-BrkNter is not folded at 25 °C. The backbone of apo-BrkNter is highly dynamic and does not adopt a defined structure.
In contrast, addition of an equimolar amount of omb12 DNA (which corresponds in sequence to an in vivo binding site of Brk6) induces a drastic change in the 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum. The folded amino acid residues (R46 to R95) constitute the proper DNA-binding domain. The N-terminal part (before R46) remained unfolded and highly flexible.
DNA binding induces partial folding of BrkNter.
Gaps in the current model include 85 residues of the native sequence at the N-terminus and 11 loops of varying length throughout the rest of the sequence.
Several large loops, which are disordered in the current structure, potentially interact with the incoming RNA. These loops include: a 15-residue loop (699–713) in the fist, a 29-residue region (361–389) in domain 2, and an 18-residue loop (943–961) in domain 4.
Each of these disordered regions contains conserved, positively charged residues that could interact with a negatively charged RNA backbone.
Mtr4 folds into a globular DExH ATPase core and features an insertion that forms a protruding structural unit. The crystal asymmetric unit contains two independent molecules. M Molecule B has well-defined electron density for the DExH core. However, residues 672 to 809 in the protruding region and three loops are disordered in molecule B and could not be modeled.
We find that the KOW domain of Mtr4 is indeed able to bind a structured RNA such as in vitro transcribed tRNA-iMet. Given the function of Mtr4 in processing structured RNAs and given its conformational flexibility around the end of the stalk domain, it is tempting to speculate that the KOW domain might assist the helicase in recognizing structured RNAs and present them to the unwinding β-hairpin of the DExH core.

BRCA2(21–39) (magenta) binds across a hydrophobic pocket at the crossover between blades 4 and 5 of the PALB2‐C β‐propeller, forming a short α‐helix.
Analysis of these chemical shifts confirmed that BRCA2 48–284 shows no stable fold: it is intrinsically disordered, with only short, transient α-helices.
The narrow range of backbone amide 1H chemical shifts (between 7.5 and 8.5 ppm) for all BRCA2 fragments reveals their disordered behavior.
The secondary structure analysis, based on 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shifts and the neighbor corrected structural propensity method (Tamiola et al. 2010; Tamiola and Mulder 2012), confirms the absence of a stable fold for BRCA2 53–131, BRCA2 48–218(C4A) and BRCA2 190–284.
We concluded that the fragment of BRCA2 from amino acid 48 to amino acid 284 is disordered and that its shorter segments BRCA2 53–131, BRCA2 48–218(C4A) and BRCA2 190–284 have the same structural properties when isolated or within BRCA2 48–284(C4A).
H522-102 are disordered

They have constructed a skeletal TnC-TnI chimera to study the structure and dynamics of the regulatory region of troponin, combining the skeletal N-terminal domain of TnC (sNTnC) and the C-terminal region of TnI (sTnI) in a single polypeptidic chain (chicken fast skeletal was used).
"These values are typical for a globular domain for sTnC and a disordered region for the C-terminal region of sTnI."
The following recombinant construct of chicken fast skeletal muscle troponin was used: TnC (amino acids 1–162) (the Ile-130 residue replaces Thr-130), Cys-less TnI (amino acids 1–182).
"There was no visible electron density for the 39 C-terminal amino acid residues (144–182) of TnI"
From a series of 1D 1H, 2D 1H,1H TOCSY, and 2D 1H,1H NOESY experiments, we assigned the AMSH-P2 backbone and side-chain protons in the free state. Reflects the fact that AMSH-P2 is unstructured in the free state.
As in the free state, it is important to mention that we only detected i,i + 1 sequential NOEs, supporting the fact that AMSH-P2 is also unstructured when bound to SH3.
Residues of the heparin-binding module of HBEGF (residues 73–106). These are not visible in electron-density maps and are presumably disordered.
In the final model of SPN1, residues 31-33, 72-91, 162-165 and 288-348 of one complex in the asymmetric unit, and residues 30-32, 74-92, 162-165 and 291-348 of the other one were not defined in the electron density map and thus they were not built.

We first collected 1H-15N NMR HSQC spectra of TRP120-1TR as a function of pH (5.5, 6.0, 6.5 and 7.0), and observed that the protein is essentially unstructured in solution at all pHs tested. The NMR spectrum shows around 80 (of the 102 residues) resonances between 6.7 and 8.6 ppm. Most of the chemical shifts correspond to that of a random and thus NMR data are consistent with a natively unfolded protein.
The pH of ehrlichial morulae where TRP120 is expressed is slightly acidic. Addition of DNA to TRP120-1TR at pH 5.5 resulted in several new peaks with significant differences in chemical shifts, suggesting an increase in β-strand content. Peaks corresponding to several side chain NH2 of Asn/Gln residues were resolved in the DNA-bound spectrum, indicating that they become structured upon DNA binding.
The far-UV CD spectra of TRP120-1TR at pH 7.0 showed a profile with a minimum centered at 200 nm, indicating that TRP120 TR units are mostly intrinsically disordered. A shallow negative feature centered at 220 nm suggests a small percentage of β-turn/β-sheet secondary structure. CD spectra of TRP120-2TR measured as a function of pH (7.0, 6.0 and 4.5) showed similar profiles.
Although the predicted molecular weight of TRP120-1TR based on the primary sequences is 11.5 kDa, the construct migrates with apparent molecular weight of ~19 kDa. The analytical ultracentrifugation clearly shows that both TRP120-1TR and -2TR proteins are monomers with expected molecular weights. Thus, aberrant migration of the TRP120 TR unit on SDS-PAGE is intrinsic to the nature of the domain.
Far-UV CD spectropolarimetry of HMGA2 produced a spectrum with a minimum at 199 nm followed by a flat line from 210 to 250 nm. This spectrum appeared identical to that of a disordered protein.
The HSQC spectrum of HMGA2 displayed a very narrow chemical shift range in the proton dimension that is highly characteristic of a disordered protein. In particular, the 1H resonances fall between 7.9 and 8.6 ppm.
Upon interaction with a replication fork (RF), HMGA2 forms an equimolar complex by binding in a side-by-side orientation. It is necessary for HMGA2 to be in a disordered state such that it has the flexibility to stabilize a stalled RF by binding to the necessary AT-rich sites.
In general, the Kratky analysis of SAXS data for proteins provided qualitative information on the overall shape of the biomolecule of interest. The ascending linear curve (coral) observed for HMGA2 in the Porod-Debye Plateau region was indicative of a disordered protein, which agrees with results from the CD and NMR analyses.
The disordered loop (residues 445–455) becomes ordered and extends the five-turn helix (a7) to a continuous and kinked (at Pro447) eight-turn helix (Fig 2A–D).
The limited proteolytic digestion analysis suggested that residues between 368 and 403 in hEme1 are connected by a highly flexible linker, which we presumed to be a loop region
The limited proteolytic digestion analysis suggested that residues between 368 and 403 in hEme1 are connected by a highly flexible linker, which we presumed to be a loop region
Cleavage of the 36R linker of hEme1 into two parts also significantly decreased the nuclease activity and the DNA-binding affinity of the hMUS81ΔN complex. Reducing the size of this cleaved linker of hEme1 by 10 or 26 residues abrogated the DNA-binding and nuclease activities of hMUS81ΔN on 3′ flap and nHJ substrates, demonstrating the importance of this 36R linker in DNA binding and cleavage.

Taken together, we propose that the primary role of the 36R linker is to recognize the duplex portion of a substrate DNA and to stabilize the interaction between the MUS81ΔN complex and the substrate DNA, which appears to be required for efficient cleavage.

The relatively high Rfree is likely due to the significant proportion of poorly disordered residues
Residues 47–109 of Nup50 were not visible and were probably disordered in the crystal, possibly because this region of Nup50 is rich in glycine.
2D [1 H,15N]-HSQC NMR analysis of SRC-2 RID (res. 624-829), which contains three LXXLL motifs revealed very poor spectral dispersion and missing peaks which often make the analysis of disordered proteins such as SRC-2 RID problematic. Using 2D and 3D 13C-detected NMR methods, we obtained backbone chemical shift assignments for 213 of the 235 residues (91%) of tagged SRC-2 RID.
Addition of PPARg-RXRa LBD heterodimer resulted in significant peak line broadening and disappearance of NMR peaks for residues within, flanking, and linking all three LXXLL motifs in SRC-2 RID. This indicates that all three LXXLL motifs are likely in direct contact with PPARg-RXRa.
Here, we present the crystal structure of the intact Escherichia coli RelB2E2 complex at 2.8 Å resolution, comprising both the RelB-inhibited RelE and the RelB dimerization domain that binds DNA.  The results thus provide a firm basis for understanding the model of conditional cooperativity at the molecular level.
The structure covers most of RelE (residues 2–80 of 95) and one molecule of RelB (residues 2–79 of 79), whereas the other two RelB molecules lack either the C terminus (residues 2–69) or N terminus (residues 33–79) due to poor electron density (Figure 1A). The flexible, C-terminal helix of RelE (helix α3, residues 85–95) is disordered in all molecules in this crystal form
In the free RelE(R81A/R83A) structure, helix alpha4 at the C terminus adopts a closed conformation contacting with the beta-sheet core and adjacent loops. In the RelE(R81A/R83A)-RelB(C) complex, helix alpha3(*) of RelB(C) displaces alpha4 of RelE(R81A/R83A) from the binding site on the beta-sheet core. This helix replacement results in neutralization of a conserved positively charged cluster of RelE by acidic residues from alpha3(*) of RelB. The released helix alpha4 becomes unfolded, adopting an open conformation with increased mobility

Our structures indicate that RelB counteracts the toxic activity of RelE by displacing alpha4 helix from the catalytically competent position found in the free RelE structure.

On the other hand, the chemical shift index analysis of RelER81A/R83A revealed an unfolding of a C-terminal helix (α4) coupled with RelBC binding (supplemental Fig. S3, C and D)
the C-terminal tail (Ala81-Leu95) in cyan [...] Comparison of RelBC-bound RelER81A/R83A to the unbound structure reveals a pronounced conformational change of α4 and adjacent loops (loop α3-β2 and β4-α4). The α4 swings out from the surface of the central β-sheet as it is displaced by the amphipathic helix α3* from RelBC in the complex (Figs. (Figs.33 and and4).4). The large chemical shift perturbation in the C-terminal tail region of RelER81A/R83A by RelBC is because of a conformational change rather than direct interaction (Fig. 2, A and C, and supplemental Fig. S4, A and B). The released α4 becomes unfolded, as evidenced by the chemical shift index analysis results (supplemental Fig. S3, C and D).[...] Upon binding of RelBC, RelER81A/R83A displays large changes in both the hetNOE and R2 values, especially around the C-terminal helix α4 region. A dramatic reduction in hetNOE and R2 values within the α4 region is observed, indicating an increase in the mobility of this region (supplemental Fig. S5, B and D).

In the free RelE(R81A/R83A) structure, helix alpha4 at the C terminus adopts a closed conformation contacting with the beta-sheet core and adjacent loops. In the RelE(R81A/R83A)-RelB(C) complex, helix alpha3(*) of RelB(C) displaces alpha4 of RelE(R81A/R83A) from the binding site on the beta-sheet core.

Our structures indicate that RelB counteracts the toxic activity of RelE by displacing alpha4 helix from the catalytically competent position found in the free RelE structure.


The perturbation of the proper arrangement of critical residues at an active site seems to be a common theme for the inactivation mechanism of RelE/ParE superfamily TA systems.  Our structural studies provide evidence that RelB antitoxin directly inhibits RelE toxin through binding to the active site, although the formation of a RelE2-RelB2 complex mediated through the N-terminal dimerization domain of RelB (16) may also spatially block RelE from entering the ribosomal A-site where the RNA cleavage takes place
The central region, comprising residues 40−65, is substantially disordered despite having a significant role in the activation of LpL.

In the refined model, residues 161–163 of Skp1 and residues 132–135, 242–271, and 384–387 of Fbx4core were not visible in the electron density maps and are likely to be disordered.
After performing NMR experiments, the authors found nor the free nor the bound to Zn(+2) A-b peptides (1-16) (from the Amyloid beta-A4 region 672 to 687) have a regular structure but a serie of bend, coil and turn regions without regular secondary structure. In addition, they described a relatively fast (in NMR timescale) exchange between several conformational states, typical from an unstructured peptides/proteins.
The NMR spectra of free rat Ab(1–16) contain sharp signals typical of small monomeric peptides, but they become broader upon addition of Zn(2+). The observed changes in the spectra indicate the formation of a complex of rat Ab(1–16) with Zn(2+) ions.
Apart from a long, flexible loop (residues 112–121), amino acids 52–204 could be modeled unequivocally
into the electron density map of full-length Pml1p. The remaining N-terminal part (residues1–51) could not be traced (...). This finding confirmed the results of our biochemical analyses, suggesting that the first 51 residues of Pml1p are unstructured in the isolated protein.

NMR secondary chemical shifts for the free Pml1p (22-42)  clearly evidenced a disordered structure -no secondary structure tendency-.
Equilibrium CD spectra of Pml1p-(1– 61) were consistent with a random coil structure in this part of the protein (Fig. 3B). Thus, an intrinsically unstructured portion at the N terminus of Pml1p (residues 1– 61) is sufficient for interaction with Snu17p, reminiscent of the situation in Bud13p.
The amminoacid residues, 333-349, are missing in the crystallized structure, as is known from the PDB.


Residues 458–467 were not visible in the electron density maps and are not included in the refined model
the 15 residue insertion region between helices 1 and 3 is completely disordered in the FXR crystal structure.
The C-ter part of GatE (residues 513–633) is not visible in the electron density. However, residues 591–628 present sequence similarities with the C end (residues 111–148) of a Bacillus subtilis protein, named Yqey, of unknown function (44.7% identities, 65.8% similarities for 38 residues). Hence, residues 591–633 of GatE might also form two antiparallel α helices, as in the case of the Yqey C-ter peptide (PDB 1ng6).
First, the regulatory loop of UPF12ΔCH is well ordered and folded into a 310 helix, whereas that of UPF11ΔCH is partially disordered and in an extended conformation.
Therefore, the extended loop of UPF11 points away from the helicase core and is oriented toward the solvent (Figure 4B, inset). Our structural observations suggest that the longer regulatory loop of UPF11 has a higher intrinsic flexibility than that of the regulatory loop of UPF12.
The shorter regulatory loop of UPF12ΔCH (in blue) is well ordered and folded into a 310 helix which is positioned toward the helicase core while the partially disordered longer loop of UPF11ΔCH (in cyan) is highly flexible and oriented toward the solvent.
Residues 348-359 are not visible in the electron density map.
We compared the ATPase activities of UPF11 and UPF12 and found that a longer regulatory loop did not inhibit the catalytic activity of the helicase (Figure 1C, compare purple and yellow traces). In fact, UPF11 showed a marginally higher ATPase activity than UPF12.
Contrary to our expectations of stronger inhibition of catalytic activity by the long regulatory loop, we find that activated UPF11 shows significantly higher ATPase activity than activated UPF12 (Figure 2C, compare first two columns in the middle and right stacks). Furthermore, the ATPase activity of UPF11ΔCH is identical to that of the UPF1ΔCHΔloop mutant (Figure 2C, compare second and third column in the right stack), indicating that deletion or elongation of the regulatory loop mediates similar effects on the activity of UPF1.
Residues 348-359 are not visible in the electron density map and therefore this region is disordered within the regulatory loop (PDB: 6EJ5).
We sought to determine whether presence of a longer regulatory loop in UPF1 would also mediate a similar effect on its RNA-binding affinity. To address this, we performed fluorescence anisotropy assays with UPF11ΔCH and UPF12ΔCH using a fluorescein-labeled 26-mer RNA, in the presence and absence of ATP. As previously reported, UPF12ΔCH shows a significant (18-fold) reduction in RNA-binding affinity in the presence of ATP while UPF11ΔCH shows only a modest 5-fold decrease (Figure 2D, compare cyan and green traces) (21,22). A similar trend was observed when comparing constructs encompassing the CH domain; UPF12 shows a 16-fold reduction in RNA-binding affinity in the presence of ATP in comparison to the 5-fold decrease exhibited by UPF11 (Figure 2D, compare purple and yellow traces). However, perturbing the length of the regulatory loop did not affect the length of RNA bound by UPF1 in the presence or absence of nucleotides, as observed in RNase protection assays (Supplementary Figure S2D and data not shown). Our results suggest that deletion or elongation of the regulatory loop modulates the RNA-binding affinity as well as the catalytic activity of UPF1 in a similar manner.
Residues 348-359 are not visible in the electron density map and therefore this region is disordered within the regulatory loop (PDB: 6EJ5).
To determine the mechanistic basis of this differential catalytic activity, we have determined the X-ray crystal structure of the helicase core of UPF11 in its apo-state. Our results point toward a novel mechanism of regulation of RNA helicases, wherein alternative splicing leads to subtle structural rearrangements within the protein that are critical to modulate enzyme movements and catalytic activity.
The short regulatory loop of UPF12 is more rigid and occupies part of the RNA binding surface in the apo- and AMPPNP-bound states of UPF1. Therefore, it poses as a barrier to translocation of UPF1 upon ATP hydrolysis and has to be displaced from the RNA-binding pocket in each cycle (top panel). In contrast, the longer regulatory loop of UPF11 is flexible and does not effectively block RNA binding in the presence of ATP or impede translocation (bottom panel). As a consequence, this loop does not have to be removed from the RNA-binding surface each time to allow ATP-dependent translocation of UPF1, resulting in a more active helicase.
The regulatory loop of UPF11ΔCH approaches the RNA binding surface but does not significantly occlude it or clash with the RNA (inset), in comparison to the regulatory loop of UPF12ΔCH (Figure S1B).
Residues 348-359 are not visible in the electron density map.
To assess whether the elongation of the regulatory loop has an impact on the properties of single molecules of UPF1, we compared the unwinding and translocation activities of UPF11ΔCH and UPF12ΔCH onto a long DNA hairpin.
However, UPF11ΔCH was two times faster than UPF12ΔCH with a weighted average rate of 2.4 bp/s during unwinding (1.0 bp/s for UPF12CH), and 4.6 bp/s during rezipping (2.4 bp/s for UPF12CH) (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S3). This result correlates perfectly with the higher ATP consumption rate of UPF11ΔCH compared to UPF12ΔCH (Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure S2C). Therefore, the recording of numerous and independent translocation events of single molecules of UPF1 revealed that its two natural isoforms possess different translocation speeds.
UPF11ΔCH unwinds nucleic acid with a higher translocation speed than UPF12ΔCH.
Residues 348-359 are not visible in the electron density map and therefore this region is disordered within the regulatory loop (PDB: 6EJ5).
Note that the protein sequence starts at Gly1, and the N-terminal methionine is completely excised.
"Residues 74–85 of the protein are disordered in solution."
The DNA sequencing of the pET30-EhKRS also revealed a point mutation V764I at the C-terminus.
In all structures, residues 304–368 between strands b13 and b14, residues 507–513 between helices a 15 and

The 2D 1H–15N correlation NMR experiments acquired on E1A289 and E1A243 (Figure 2 A,B) confirm that both isoforms of E1A are highly disordered and flexible, as inferred from the small chemical shift dispersion of the NMR signals.[27] (Figure 2)

The five cysteine residues were assigned and the chemical shifts values for the Cα and Cβ of Cys 154, 157, 171, and 174 are consistent with their involvement in ZnII-binding.
On the other hand, the results on the E1ACR3 clearly indicate the presence of a minimal fold composed by just two helices of less than 10 amino acids embedded in a relatively flexible polypeptide. The binding of ZnII restricts the conformational space for the two helices, which should face each other to properly locate the ligand cysteines.
A similar analysis was accomplished for E1ACR3. The SSP plot derived for the amino acids of this construct indicates the presence of two α-helices beginning with the CXXC motifs and including residues 153–165 and 170–180 (Figure 3).

The second domain (amino acids 30-180) of each monomer protrudes from the central β-domain like a wing (Fig. 1A, yellow). Each “wing” domain contains two glycosylation sites (Asn130, Asn175), an internal disulfide (Cys55-Cys143), and two discreet subdomains. An α/β subdomain (amino acids 38 – 151) comprises a four-stranded β-sheet, two α-helices and a disordered distal tip (amino acids 108 – 128; Fig. 1A, dotted line).
Region 108-128 of NS1 protein corresponds to the region 884-904 of the polyprotein of Dengue virus type 2 (strain Thailand/16681/1984).
A flexible linker region is identified which joins the NS3 protease and helicase domains allowing alternative conformations. The flexibility in this region is important for protease and helicase activity: "Our results indicate that the linker region has evolved to an optimum length to confer flexibility to the NS3 protein that is required both for polyprotein processing and RNA replication.
Thus, in both crystal forms, the protease domain appears significantly more mobile, which is consistent with proteolysis data showing that the protease domain is more labile. In the second conformation, only a few interactions are observed between the linker and either of the two domains: Glu169, Gly172, and Glu173 from the linker interact with Lys88 and Tyr83 from the protease and Arg202 and Ala197 from the P-loop (Fig. 2A). However, as a caveat, the electron density map for the linker region is less well defined for side chains of residues 169–176 (Fig. 2A). The overall B factor for the linker is 73.2 Å2, a value significantly higher than the average value for the other domains of NS3. This suggests some intrinsic degree of freedom conferred to the protein by the linker in solution.
The two domains of NS3 are linked by a polypeptide segment spanning residues 169–179. This interdomain (“linker”) acid-rich segment displays some sequence variation, yet its overall length appears to be restricted to 11 or 12 amino acids across flaviviruses. In both conformation I and II, the linker region was partially disordered with only clear electron density for the backbone (Fig. 2) (10).
The PDB shows a disordered region that corresponds to the N-terminal region of the NS3 protein.

Several regions of the polypeptide chains are disordered, namely, residues 1–32 and 499–500 in SOSSAN, residues 1–4, 11–18, 28–37, 71–81, 87–90, and 110–211 in SOSSB1, and residues 1–62 and 102–104 in SOSSC.
Although residues 1 to 103, 122 to 129, and 394 to 416 of RIIβ and residues 1 to 13 of C are missing in the electron density, we validated by using gel electrophoresis that the full-length RIIβ2:C2 complex is in the protein crystal. The absence of density for the N-terminal D/D domain and the following linker is likely related to the flexible nature of this region.

Narrow signal distribution in amide region, between 6.5 and 8.5 ppm, strongly suggest the lack of a well-defined tridimentional structure distintive of intrinsically disordered proteins.
The lack of a temperature-induced transition strongly suggests that if secondary structure segments are formed, those segments are fluctuating and do not participate in the compact core structure.
No significant secondary shifts were observed in the high-field-shifted methyl region (0–1.0 p.p.m.), suggesting that hydrophobic side chains including aromatic rings do not form any clustered regions in WCI16. [...] WCI16 does not form definitive secondary structure, such as an α-helix or β-strand. [...] there is no significant specific three-dimensional structure in WCI16.

Deconvolution of the far-UV CD spectrum of the isolated domain in aqueous solution, using the Yang reference, gave a secondary structure content of, at most, 25% alpha-helix, 75% coil, and no beta-structure. This helix content is quite far from the native content.
This fragment was studied by circular dichroism and by NMR. Both techniques clearly showed that the domain was poorly folded in pure aqueous solution although the residual helix structure is far from negligible.
A first set of NMR experiments was performed on the domain solubilized in pure aqueous solution, in which the very weak spectral dispersion of the amide proton resonances (1.1 ppm) showed that the peptide is poorly folded.

The annexin I N-terminal peptide is clearly visible in the complex, despite its high temperature factor (Figure 2). Although the stoichiometry is one peptide bound to one S100C monomer, the binding zone on S100C is formed by regions of both molecules of the dimer: the C-terminal helix and the L2 linker region of one molecule and the N-terminal helix of the other molecule.
Nevertheless, the 15N chemical shift variations, Δδ15N, are good indicators of the course of the structural change, within the different segments of the domain, associated with DPC titration.
As expected, addition of micelles led to a considerable increase in the helix content (Figure 10).
Nevertheless, the 15N chemical shift variations, Δδ15N, are good indicators of the course of the structural change, within the different segments of the domain, associated with DPC titration.
At high DPC concentration (150 mM), the NH spectral range was considerably larger than that observed in pure aqueous solution (1.7 ppm against 1.1 ppm for the pure aqueous solution).
In aqueous buffer, the CD spectrum of AnxIN26 showed a strong negative band at 200 nm and a broad band around 222 nm, indicating a predominantly random-coil conformation with a slight helical propensity [33,34].
The CD spectrum of AnxIN26 in 10 mM SDS, which is above the critical micellar concentration of SDS [38], also showed a typical α-helix pattern.
The CD spectrum of AnxIN26 in 10 mM SDS, which is above the critical micellar concentration of SDS [38], also showed a typical α-helix pattern.
Thus, it can be suggested that the conformational transition of AnxIN26, from random-coil in aqueous buffer to α-helix in membrane-mimetic environments, reflects its binding to the membrane.
As shown in Fig. 2, the presence of a typical α-helix from V4 to Q19 is supported, both in TFE/water and in SDS micelles, by the frequent observations of dNN(i,i+1), dNN(i,i+2), dαL(i,i+3), dαN(i,i+3) and dαN(i,i+4) NOE connectivities, and slowly exchanging amide protons.
The C-terminal region of the AnxIN26 helix contains frequent glutamate residues (-E15-NE-E-Q-E20-; Fig. 4A). Thus, we suggest that Ca2-ions bind to the negatively charged glutamate-rich region of AnxIN26 and function as salt-bridges between the peptide and SDS micelle molecules. The calcium-bridge in this region seems to stabilize the helical conformation of AnxIN26 as a membrane-bound form, resulting in the intensification of CD signals as shown in Fig. 5.
Calcium ions participate in the functional binding of annexin to membranes.

11 residues at the N-terminus and 4 at the C-terminus that are also disordered

Crystals of TmaL4 contain full-length protein, as seen from SDS-PAGE analysis of dissolved experiments ... A void seen in the crystal packing could accomodate the unobserved part of the molecule in a folded conformation. All these observations suggest that a large portion of TmaL4 is internally disordered.
The putative RNA interaction surface can be subdivided into two spatially separated regions. The first is made up mainly of the N-terminal part of helix alpha3. It is preceded by the 55 residue disordered loop, which is the most conserved portion in prokaryotic L4 proteins and displays many basic residues. The loop may therefore be the central element of this RNA-binding patch.
Although we observe the large conformational change in the core domain that was anticipated upon calcium binding, we were not be able to model residues 1–40 in the full-length annexin A1 structure. The mass spectrum shows without a doubt that the crystals do contain the full-length protein, however the N-terminal domain is disordered in the X-ray structure.
The N-terminal domain of annexin 1 contains 41 residues.
Annexin 1 is active in membrane aggregation and its refined 1.8 Å structure shows an alpha-helical N-terminal domain connected to the core domain by a flexible linker.
However, electron density is lacking, primarily at the C‐termini, in all eight WAT strands.
X-ray diffraction data extending to a maximum resolution of 2.5 Å were collected and the structure of the Qβ core replicase was determined by molecular replacement ... disordered are the ... EF-Tu residues 1–8 and 42–63
The structure is complete except for residues constituting ... the switch I region 42–63 of EF-Tu
In EF-Tu, we have not modelled residues 42-63, including the effector loop (some scattered densities are visible)
"The Switch I region, from residues 40–62, is well ordered in the intact Escherichia coli EF-Tu–GDP structure reported here." But authors recognize possibility of disorder: "undoubtedly, multiple alternate conformation of the 12 amino acids are possible, as demostrated by the fact that this region is ordered in the EF-Tu–Ts complex structure, but for reasons yet unknown, the beta ribbon conformation is stabilized."

The far-UV CD spectra of CspBNPi show a minimum close to 200 nm and weak ellipticity around 222 nm (Fig. 3B), which are also typical of a random coil conformation.
By means of light scattering studies, the hydrodynamic properties of Prosys were elucidated, showing that, in solution, the prohormone occurs as a monomeric protein, with a molecular mass of 23.7 ± 0.1 kDa [Fig. 1(C)], and an apparent hydrodynamic radius of 5.61 ± 0.01 nm of the monodisperse peak, which is indicative of a protein with low compactness.
As assessed by SDS-PAGE, Prosys showed an aberrant migration with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa, exceeding the expected molecular mass of 26 kDa (inclusive of the His-tag)...
Elution from the SEC column occurred as a sharp peak with an apparent molecular mass (MM app) of about 71 kDa [Fig. 1(B)], as estimated by the calibration curve [inset Fig. 1(B)]. This value was well above the expected value (MM theo) and was not compatible with a monomeric globular structure.
Prosys, incubated with different E:S ratio and at different time intervals, was readily digested already after 1 h of incubation (Fig. S1).
Prosys spectrum at neutral pH showed low ellipticity at 190 nm and a large negative ellipticity at 198 nm, typically observed for proteins in a largely disordered conformation.
The 1D [1H] NMR spectrum together with the 2D [1H,1H] TOCSY and 2D [1H,1H] NOESY experiments of Prosys presented the canonical features of the unstructured proteins, being dominated by a poor spectral dispersion, typical of IDPs.
Indeed, CD spectra revealed a disorder content (Figure 2), a reversible temperature-induced behavior, and a capability to increase secondary structure content in the presence of TFE co-solvent (Figure S4a,b).
ProSys(1-178) recombinant protein is intrinsically disordered. The Far-UV CD spectrum was recorded from 260 to 190 nm at 20 °C in 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 at a protein concentration of 6.8 µM.
The SRCD measurements confirm experimentally that MEG-14 should be classified as an IDP.
For the protein MEG-14, as a result of its quite flexible and almost fully disordered state (Lopes et al. 2013), no spectral bands were observed at ~225-nm region (lacking any ordered content), but a negative peak of ~198 nm with similar shape was observed (Suppl. Figure 2a).
The molecular mass of the recombinant MEG-14 was determined to be 10,613 ± 7 Da by MS (...) whereas SDS-PAGE analyses gave an apparent molecular mass of 13.7 kDa (Fig. 1 b). As observed for other IDPs (34, 35), the discrepancies between the sequence and hydrodynamic methods are a consequence of the extended (not globular) conformation of MEG-14 in solution and its high content of hydrophilic amino acids, which reduce its mobility on polyacrylamide gels because it binds less SDS.
Moreover, a small band at ~184 nm could be observed in the SRCD spectra of IDPs, appearing as a shoulder for STI and a small positive peak for MEG-14 (Suppl. Figure 2c). This spectral band can also be attributed to the unordered content of the protein (Wallace and Janes 2009; Lopes et al. 2013).
The SRCD spectrum of sMEG-14 in aqueous solution is typical of a disordered protein with high flexibility, aspreviously described
To that end, a yeast two hybrid screening was performed using as bait the soluble portion of MEG-14
isoform 1 (previously defined in [6]) and human leukocyte cDNA library as prey.d
Using these criteria, only two clones remained as positives, one containing a
cDNA encoding S100A9 and another encoding the C2 Freud-1 domain from the
CC2D1A protein.
It was only possible to recover sMEG-14 in the fraction bound to the resin, after the washing steps, when this protein was incubated with S100A9-GST immobilized in a glutathionesepharose resin in the presence of calcium.
Figure 3A shows a sensorgram indicating that both proteins interact immediately after S100A9 solution is applied onto the sensor chip surface in which sMEG-14 was covalently immobilized and that the intensity of the signal obtained is dependent on the concentration of S100A9 in the solution.
Experimental binding curves were fit in a plain 1:1 Langmuir binding model
and the dissociation constant (Kd) calculated under this model for the MEG-14/S100A9 complex was 1.89 µM.
The interaction of sMEG14 with the heterodimer
S100A9/S100A8 was also investigated by SPR, and although it was possible to observe interaction (Figure 3B), the affinity (Kd = 44.1 µM) has shown to be much lower than the observed for S100A9 alone.
A profile suggestive of interaction between sMEG-14 and S100A9 was also obtained by performing an experiment of microscale thermophoresis (Supplementary Figure 3)
Comparison of the spectrum produced by the sum of these two spectra with the spectra obtained experimentally for an equimolar mixture of these two proteins shows there is a significant red shift and increase in the peak magnitude at 184 nm. Changes of this type at this wavelength are primarily associated with a decrease in disordered content. In addition, a small increase of the peak at 222 nm was detected, thus suggesting a concomitant increase in alpha-helix content (Table 1). These results clearly show that the proteins physically interact to form a complex, and upon formation of the complex, they undergo a conformational change consistent with ordering of the MEG-14 partner.

In this work, we combined NMR experiments and MD simulations to characterize the conformational ensemble of the TCTP intrinsically disordered loop, in the presence or not of calcium ions and with or without the phosphorylation of Ser46 and Ser64
we propose that the TCTP intrinsically disordered region could play an important role in participating to the interactions with other proteins and non-peptidic ligands, in remodeling the core domain surface, and modulating its accessibility to its partners in response to a variety of cellular conditions, in particularly the presence of calcium ions, or to chemical modifications, such as phosphorylations.
in the loop of residues T39-V66 have 1H–15N NOE values <0.5 with an average value of −0.11 ± 0.49. This clearly indicates that hTCTP has a rather rigid well-folded core and a very flexible loop Lβ5β6, and the rigid to flexible transitions occur in the β-sheet C between these two structural regions. The analysis of R1 and R2 values also indicates the same conclusion.
Residues 1–41 and 62–180, and 1–40 and 64–180 were modeled for chains A and B of the hHRF-1 structure, respectively, and as in the mHRF structure, a substantial portion of the mobile loop region was disordered.
Residues 1–41 and 63–178, and 1–37 and 50–177 were modeled for chains A and B of the hHRF-2 structure, respectively.
Two structures of hHRF are described in the publication, hHRF-1 (PDB:5o9l) and hHRF-2 (PDB:5o9m), the latter revealing a disulphide-linked dimer
HRF crystal and solution structures have provided little insight into either the formation of disulphide-linked HRF dimers or the ability of HRF to activate mast cells.
The current model for the activity of HRF in mast cell activation involves cross-linking of FcεRI-bound IgE by dimeric HRF, mediated by interactions between HRF and the Fab regions of IgE
No electron density was detected for residues 1–18, 167–181 and 216–266.

Deviations greater than 1 ppm from ncIDP 15N and 13C chemical shift values were shown to be a powerful indicator of secondary structure. The observable regions of the arch, α2–α3 loop and C-terminal residues showed only small differences (≤1) suggesting that these residues were disordered in the free protein.

Here, we report that an N-terminal extension that is proximal to the YTH domain enhances RNA binding. Using X-ray crystallography, NMR, and biophysical methods, we show that this low-complexity region becomes more ordered upon RNA binding.
Here, we show that a low-complexity region proximal to the Mmi1 YTH domain is required for stable RNA binding. Biophysical and structural analyses show that this region undergoes dynamic changes on RNA binding and decreases the off-rate for DSR RNA substantially. Thus, a low-complexity region proximal to a folded RNA-binding domain can strongly influence interactions with RNA substrates.
The calculation of the chemical shift index based on the obtained resonance assignment indicates an intrinsically disordered peptide which is supported by the prediction of the web server (IUPRED53) using the primary sequence as sole input.
Here we report the NMR resonance assignment and heme interaction studies for the N-terminal peptide stretch of CBS. We present NMR-spectral evidence that residues 1–40 constitute an intrinsically disordered region in CBS and interact with heme via a cysteine-proline based motif.
We purified a uniformly 15N labeled sample of human MCM2

The N-terminal 12 residues are disordered and so excluded from the final model.
The structure lacks the 53 C-terminal residues, presumably because these residues were disordered in the crystal packing or degraded during the extended crystallization period.
Amino acid residues 1 to 213, which includes the first eleven residues of VP3, were not ordered in the density maps. The lack of ordering of the N-terminus region of VP1–VP3 is consistent with all known parvovirus structures determined to date, except for B19 in which the entire VP2 was observed in a structure determined by cryo-electron microscopy.
Amino acids C-terminal to αK (aa 333–416) are disordered in the structure.
Our modeling of hDOT1L-nucleosome interaction suggests that the C-terminal region is near DNA, which led us to hypothesize that the disordered C-terminal positively charged region might be involved in substrate binding by interacting with the negatively charged nucleosomal DNA.
For structural work, a shortened construct of HP0564 was created that lacks the flexible N-terminal 20 residues as well as the C-terminal 7 residues.
In addition, the 45
loop is highly disordered (Figure 2), showing large structural
variations with distances between corresponding CR positions
of up to 10 Å (Phe85)
type I
receptor BMPR-IA, a significant part of the binding interface
with BMP-2 is disordered prior to ligand binding and thus
requires a disorder-to-order transition
The significance of the
rearrangement of the 45 loop is illustrated by the shifts of Phe85
and Gln86 of BMPR-IA into binding-competent positions. Gln86
represents the main binding determinant in the BMP-2-BMPRIA
interaction, demonstrating that a stable complex can be formed
only if the 45 loop adopts a helical structure.
Circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the epsin DPW region show little absorption above 210 nm and a large minimum at 200 nm, indicating little secondary structure in solution
Solution studies of the 17.7 kDa epsin DPW region (aa 229–407) indicate that the repeated binding motifs are highly accessible for interaction with the α-ear.
Dynamic light scattering of the DPW region corroborates that this region is predominantly disordered in solution.

Overlap of 15N,1H-HSQC spectra of complexes between unlabeled calpain and 15N-labeled calpastatin comprising residues 128-236 (black) and 134-219 (red).

The final model (refined against data collected previously at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source on P1 native crystal form) is well defined with the exception of the following disordered regions that were omitted: 245-260, 273-278, 292-321, 437-459 and 565-566 (indicated by dotted lines in Figure 1B).

circular dichroism (CD) experiments revealed that each RPEL peptide is largely unstructured in solution (α-helical content of 5.2, 4 and 4.3%, respectively) (Supplementary Figure S1), indicating that the observed RPEL peptide secondary structure is induced on binding actin.

This disordered state is supported by CD results of the isolated domains, which show that the PDZ2 domains are structured, but the CT domain is largely disordered.
The far-ultraviolet irradiation circular dichroism (CD) spectrum
of the isolated CT (Figure 3B) exhibits a strong negative band at 205 nm and a weak shoulder near 220 nm, consistent with a largely disordered conformation with little regular secondary structure
The spectra of  PDZ2-CT construct (residues 150–358) show a pronounced negative band at 222 nm indicative of helical conformation
The remaining unassigned peaks due to the C-terminal segment form a dense cluster in the center of the HSQC spectrum characteristic of a disordered conformation.
The NMR results indicate that the last 11 residues at the C terminus of NHERF1 participate in binding and adopt an a-helical conformation when bound to PDZ2.
the noncovalent complex between the isolated PDZ2 and CT domains serves as a reliable model for understanding the intramolecular interaction between PDZ2 and the C-terminal domain of NHERF1
The 1H-15 N HSQC spectrum of PDZ2CT (amino acid residues 150–358) is characteristic of a heterogeneous conformation of a structured PDZ domain, coexisting with a largely disordered C-terminal region that typically yields a high density of sharp peaks between 8 and 8.5 ppm in the proton dimension.
They solved the crystal structure of the oxidized form of Prdx4 from Mus musculus (3VWU). Prdx4 forms a homodecamer within which each dimer constitutes an functional unit. The C-terminal segment (residues 242-274) has been shown to be highly flexible corresponding to missing coordinates in X-ray structures of certain subunits (ambiguous experimental evidence).

.
They determined the crystal structure of P5 in complex with the Prdx4 C-terminal peptide (residues 244-263 from Mus musculus Prdx4). 
"peptide electron density was visible only for the region from Glu246 to Gly251, and, thus, we found it bound a hydrophobic groove of P5"

There is no density for 89 residues at the N terminus, which were either not present or not ordered in those crystals.
Three additional disordered loops lie on the outer surface of the protein away from the active site.

Biochemical studies of intact CREB have demontrated that the pKID domain is unusually susceptible to proteolysis  [PMID:1671708] and hence likely to be unstructured. Biophysical characterization of the isolated pKID domain (residues 101 - 160 of human CREB, 60 residues) was limited in the original study of a pKID-CBP complex by the phosphopeptide’s sparing solubility in the absence of guanidine hydrochloride.
The three-dimensional structure of a CREB pKID-CBP regulatory complex has recently been described [PMID:9413984] and provides a model of a coil to helix transition on assembly of a transcriptional activator-coactivator complex.
In far-ultraviolet (UV) circular dichroism, ID3 has a strong negative peak around 200 nm, typical of random coil proteins, with a slight tendency to local secondary structure formation
we carried out the competition assay by titrating recombinant ID3 into the acetylation reaction with active, full-length CBP. The free ID3 was found to compete with the ID3 of full-length CBP for binding the substrate, ZFP106-f, causing a significant concentration-dependent decrease in the acetylation of ZFP106-f
The 1H-15N correlation spectrum exhibits all of the peculiar NMR features of an IDP
Both in SDS-PAGE and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), the apparent molecular weight (Mw) of ID3 is about 70 kDa, two times its actual Mw, which is often the first indication of structural disorder
Both in SDS-PAGE and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), the apparent molecular weight (Mw) of ID3 is about 70 kDa, two times its actual Mw, which is often the first indication of structural disorder
Lack of long-lasting structural elements in ID3 allowed the employment of a heat-treatment step17 in the protein purification protocol, which increases the purity and stability of the sample. This was confirmed by comparing circular dichroism and 2D 1H-15N NMR spectra of ID3 obtained with and without this step
SAXS measurements [following removal of potential aggregates by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)] yielded an average radius of gyration (Rg) of 80 Å of the different conformers in solution (Fig. 1c and e), corresponding to a disordered state.
Lipid raft LUVs did not prevent the degradation of α-casein, a protein with an open conformation that is susceptible to proteolysisat all temperatures.
Owing to flexible parts, none of the subunits display electron density before amino acid 18 and after amino acid 192. Density is also absent for the loop between amino acids 64 and 73.

In silico analysis and circular dichroism experiments (Fig. 5) showed that ZFP106-f is also largely disordered, which suggests a rather transient binding between the two IDRs that can occur either via a mutual (synergistic) folding39 or a “fuzzy” interaction31, in which both IDRs remain largely disordered.

Figure 4. CD spectra of BnaDGAT11-80 and BnaDGAT181-113. Residues 1 to 80 are highly disordered
The highly disordered region of BnaDGAT1, residues 1 to 80, was found to facilitate dimerization, as evident from cross-linking studies (Fig. 7).
The mobility of these recombinant proteins on SDS-PAGE was atypical as they migrated slower than expected, based on their expected molecular masses (16 kDa and 9 kDa, respectively) (Fig. 2 inset). This lower mobility, specifically observed with the recombinant N-terminal domains of BnaDGAT11-80, is often observed in IDPs (eg. Juxtanodin) and attributed to the lack of hydrophobic amino acid residues and anomalous interaction with SDS.
Disorder is also claimed for the longer segment 1-113, but in the previous paper they have shown that the segment 81-113 is folded.
Additionally, these purified constructs were susceptible to proteolysis despite the addition of protease inhibitors.
Disorder is also claimed for the longer segment 1-113, but in the previous paper they have shown that the segment 81-113 is folded.
These studies confirmed the molecular masses 13.9 kDa (BnaDGAT11-113) and 8.6 kDa (BnaDGAT11-80). The apparent molecular mass calculated from SEC-MALLS were lower than that calculated using SEC standards demonstrating the nonglobular and monomeric nature of the purified constructs.
Disorder is also claimed for the longer segment 1-113, but in the previous paper they have shown that the segment 81-113 is folded.
In the absence of ligand, both proteins exhibited a negative minimum close to 200 nm, a typical observation for disordered proteins37 (Fig. 4A,B).
Disorder is also claimed for the longer segment 1-113, but in the previous paper they have shown that the segment 81-113 is folded.
The scattering profiles, for the various forms of BnaDGAT11-113, exhibited a typical profile of IDRs (Fig. 5A).
Here, with the low-resolution techniques disorder is claimed for the longer segment 1-113, but in the previous paper they have shown that the segment 81-113 is folded.
The Kratky plots do not have maxima, but instead have a short plateau followed by a monotonic increase at higher value of [q]. This indicates the presence of a highly extended particle for BnaDGAT11-113, thus confirming the intrinsically disordered nature of the N-terminal region of BnaDGAT11-113 (Fig. 5B).
ITC was performed to investigate the interaction thermodynamics of BnaDGAT1 N-terminal domain with acyl-CoA and CoA. Four independent systems were analyzed: BnaDGAT11-113 or BnaDGAT11-80 in combination with oleoyl-CoA or CoA.
Interestingly, BnaDGAT11-80 also interacted with both ligands but with lower affinity (Kd of 117 μM for oleoyl-CoA and Kd of 178 μM for CoA) (Fig. 3C, D).
Contrary to the above, BnaDGAT11-80 showed a decreased helicity upon ligand binding, along with a decrease in random coil nature as demonstrated by the decrease in negative ellipticity at ~200 nm (Fig. 4B). Overall, these observations suggest that there is some gain in helical structure for the entire segment (1-113) and reduction in the random coil nature of the shorter segment upon ligand binding.
This example illustrates the potential of 15N-detection to improve resolution in 2D 1H-15N correlation spectra of challenging IDRs such as Surf6-N
The tertiary fold of chemokines is largely stabilized by two characteristic disulfide bonds which link the flexible N-terminus to the chemokine core.
We propose that the pH-dependent structural lability of CCL28 is important for its role as both a chemoattractant and antimicrobial agent
In addition to having a third, non-canonical disulfide bond, CCL28 has an extended C-terminal domain of 28 residues which follows the most C-terminal cysteine residue (cysteine 80). Our structural and functional analyses revealed that the extended C-terminal domain of CCL28 is unstructured and dynamic
The last cysteine in the sequence is Cys99, referred to as "cysteine 80" in the paper since the authors cloned the human CCL28 gene lacking its signal peptide (19 amino acids)"
Only residues corresponding to the N-terminal and central domains are visible in our RluF–RNA electron density maps. The C-terminal domain, shown by limited proteolysis to comprise residues Thr253–Arg290, is disordered.
The N-terminal region, corresponding to the first ∼95 residues in FL_pCopN, and the last ∼15 C-terminal residues were disordered both in FL_pCopN and in D29

Upon interaction with the RalA-HVR, the central helix of CaM undergoes extensive unfolding between residues Lys75 and Glu84. Melting of this helix to this extent, although uncommon in CaM structures, is consistent with previous observations that helical content decreases upon complex formation with the RalA HVR (23). This unfolded linker, coupled with the partial disorder of the HVR, results in the lack of fixed orientation of the N-lobe with respect to the C-lobe (Fig. 3A). There is a notable absence of interlobe NOEs, and residues of the central linker show only short-range, mostly intraresidue NOEs, which are not indicative of secondary structure.

both bPY-NLSs and hPY-NLSs bind Kapβ2 in an extended conformation, with structural conservation at the arginine and proline-tyrosine residues of their C-terminal R/K/Hx2–5PY motifs and at their N-terminal basic or hydrophobic motifs.
Analysis of ribosomal features involved in dynamic aspects of protein biosynthesis that are partially or fully disordered in H50S revealed the conformations of intersubunit bridges in unbound subunits, suggesting how they may change upon subunit association and how movements of the L1-stalk may facilitate the exit of tRNA.
The
C-terminal 18 residues, including several large hydrophobic residues,

CED-4b exhibits a similar structure, except that its CARD domain is flexible and disordered in the crystals.
Residues that are not visible in the structure are grey
The same residue range is visible in the olipudase alfa structure, suggesting ASM N and C termini are inherently disordered and flexible. The structure includes an N-terminal saposin domain (residues 84–167), a proline-rich linker (168–195), a catalytic metallophosphatase domain (196–538), and a helical C-terminal domain (539–611) (Fig. 1)

Thus, residues 611–669 appear to be disordered in the PutA86-669 structures.
No clear electron density was seen for residues 1–43 or 538–551, and loops between residues 65–72, 97–108, 168–182, 257–264, and 414–423 were also disordered and not included in the final model.

Residues 538-956 are unobserved in the crystal structure of yeast Ndc10.
During purifications of the full-length protein, we identified a 64.6-kDa proteolytically derived fragment of Ndc10, which was determined to contain residues 1–551 of the N-terminal.
Residues 538-956 are unobserved in the crystal structure of yeast Ndc10.
Both the full-length protein and this fragment were found to be competent for DNA binding against a random (non-centromeric) DNA sequence (Fig. 1b).
The tail region of hH4 (S1–D24) is not observable in all dipolar‐based experiments due to significant scaling down of the relevant dipolar couplings caused by high flexibility
In this report, the bsTyrRS numbering system is adopted for YRS to minimize confusion. Like bsTyrRS, YRS also contains three domains. The N-terminal α/β domain (0–220) and the α-helical domain (248–323) are connected via a linker peptide (221–247), while the C-terminal domain (324–421) is disordered in the crystal.
# Curator comment : YRS disordered region correspond to C-terminal domain (323–420) #
The structure of full-length MC159 was first solved at 3.8Å resolution by single-wavelength anomalous diffraction and fourfold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging (Figure 2A). It revealed that more than fifty residues at the C-terminal tail of MC159 were disordered in the crystal.
The structure revealed that a large segment of the C-terminal tail (residues 188–241) is disordered in the crystal. This C-terminal tail is not important for the function of MC159 (Garvey et al., 2002a).
The missing electron density region starts at residue Pro192.
To address the relevance of the TRAF consensus-binding motif for the observed interactions, we generated MC159 expression constructs that were either doubly mutated in the first two identical TRAF-binding motifs (MC159 DM) or C-terminally deleted to remove all three potential binding sites (MC159 Δ) (Figure 2a). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using these MC159 FLIP mutants revealed that the first two TRAF-binding motifs were specifically required for TRAF3 binding, while binding of TRAF1 and TRAF2 did not appear to be affected by the mutation or deletion of these TRAF-binding sites under conditions of overexpression (Figure 2c).

The double mutant (DM) and the C-terminally deleted form of MC159 FLIP (Δ) failed to bind to TRAF3, as was previously observed under conditions of overexpression in 293T cells (Figure 2c). TRAF2 still bound to both mutants, although at reduced levels, possibly because TRAF3 contributed to optimal recruitment and/or stabilization of endogenous TRAF2 in the complex.
The percentage of cells that had internalized the receptor correlated well with the percentage of annexin V-positive, apoptotic cells in the same experiments, suggesting that the TRAF3-binding-dependent capacity of MC159 FLIP to inhibit receptor internalization accounted for its antiapoptotic effect (Figure 5c). Together, these data suggest that the intact TRAF3-binding site of MC159 FLIP is required to fully prevent ligand-induced Fas internalization and apoptosis.

TRM6 contains 478 amino acid residues, comprising an N-terminal β-barrel domain (residues 1–196) and a C-terminal Rossmann fold domain (residues 197–451). Due to the flexibility, residues 61–78, residues 88–188, residues 322–325 and residues 453–478 are not observed.

Crystals of the full-length C protein were unstable and disordered and did not diffract X-rays to high resolution. Assuming that the crystal disorder was caused by flexible regions in the protein, we treated the full-length protein with trypsin, resulting in a stable fragment starting at Val23 and ending at Arg98 (Figure 1).
 The N-terminal region corresponds to the disordered region (residues 1–22) that was cleaved off by the trypsin treatment, and the C-terminal region corresponds to helix α4, which forms an 11 Å wide tunnel in the tetramer (Figure 3B).

The Cbf5 CTE was not observed in crystal, likely due to protein degradation and intrinsic disorder
Assignment of the backbone atom resonances of mNgn2 was performed based on 3D experiments on the 15N, 13C doubly-labelled protein (Additional file 4: Table S1, Additional file 5: 3D NMR dataset). This assignment does not cover the full-length protein: the detected domains correspond to residues 1 to 31 and 49 to 75, containing two SP sites and one TP site.

Here we have determined the three-dimensional structure of the 40 residue coiled-coil oligomerization domain of FIP2 in the absence of Rab11 using NMR methods. The N-terminal half showed strong NOE cross-peaks and well dispersed NMR resonances, whereas the C-terminal half had fewer NOE cross-peaks and less chemical shift dispersion. The C-terminal 10 residues were mostly disordered.
Consistent with this hypothesis, these two structures with and without Rab11 in the RHCC covered area suggest that the change does not result from conformational changes within Rab11 (48), but from extra helix formation within FIP2 associated with the disorder-to-order transition that is centered on the Rab11 binding domain region of FIP2.
The structure of SpLsm3 was solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) phasing method using a SeMet-substituted crystal. The final model has been refined to an R factor of 24.3% and Rfree of 27.7% with good stereochemical geometry. Residues 1–8 in the N-terminal and residues 56–69 in the loop region are disordered in the electron density map.
AtLEA4-5 was predicted to be disordered based on previous amino acid sequence analysis, while CD spectra showed a typical spectrum for a disorder protein, as indicated by the presence of minimum at ∼200 nm (Fig. S1), in agreement with previous reports
The data shows that AtLEA4-5 contains a single binding site for Ni(II), while Zn(II) and Cu(II) have multiple binding sites and promote oligomerization. The Cu(II) interacts preferentially with histidine residues mostly located in the C-terminal region with moderate affinity and different coordination modes.
To determine the secondary structure of AtLEA4-2 and AtLEA4-5 in solution, the purified proteins were analyzed by far UV CD. The results obtained corroborated that both proteins are mostly disordered in solution over a wide range of temperatures (Fig. 2, A and B) and pH (data not shown), with the characteristic negative band for random coil structures around 198 nm.
Several regions are disordered, namely residues 1–5 and 78–80 in Sp-Lsm5, residues 74–75 in SpLsm6, and residues 1–31, 69–77 and 101–113 in SpLsm7.

The structure of SpLsm4N was also determined by the SAD method using the data obtained from a SeMet derivative crystal. The structure has been refined at a resolution of 2.2 Å to an R factor of 23.7% and Rfree of 25.2% with good geometry. The final model covers residues 12–71 of every molecule in the AU. Residues 1–11 and 72–91 are not visible in the electron density map and assumed to be disordered

The human EJC core complex was reconstituted combining full-length MAGO bound to the RRM domain of Y14, full-length eIF4AIII bound to the SELOR domain of BTZ,  a U15 RNA, AMPPNP, and magnesium ions. In the final model  eIF4AIII residues 22–411 was observed, other portions of the protein are not present in the structure.
"The final model includes six bases of polyU RNA, AMPPNP, essentially all of Mago-Y14 (Mago residues 4–146 and Y14 residues 66-154), most of eIF4AIII (except for the 20 N-terminal residues that are disordered)"
The N-terminal region of eIF4AIII is disordered, as referenced in Table S2 and confirmed upon visual inspection of the structure.
No ordered electron density was present for the N-terminal region of eIF4AIII (residues 1–20) and for the N-terminal residues and a disordered loop of CWC22 (residues 116–122 and 142–148).
The  electron  density  maps  did  not  show  any  ordered  density  for  the  N-terminal  arm  of  any  of  three protein  subunits.
The helix of ORC1 that includes residues 661–674 is disordered in our structure.
The main chain electron density is continuous except for a 20-aa segment (Thr-198–Ala-217), which was disordered in both of the molecules in the asymmetric unit and could not be modeled reliably. 
Part of loop-5, residues 198–217, is disordered and appears to be entirely exposed to the solvent.
Circular dichroism spectra of LOX-PP showed a single minimum near 200 nm, which is characteristic of an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) (Fig. 2a). 
The presence of intrinsic disorder has been confirmed experimentally by CD and SAXS experiments. However, LOX-PP is partially structured as shown by deconvolution of CD spectra, which demonstrated the presence of a low amount of α-helix and β-strands.
The experimental Rg/Rh ratio (1.2) was higher than 0.7, which indicates that LOX-PP behaves as a non-globular protein, and is likely to be extended, which is consistent with the presence of intrinsic disorder in LOX-PP. Furthermore, the Kratky plot was indicative of a non-globular natively unfolded molecule (Fig. 4c), and the normalized Kratky plot confirmed that LOX-PP is indeed flexible (Fig. 4d).
The presence of intrinsic disorder has been confirmed experimentally by CD and SAXS experiments. However, LOX-PP is partially structured as shown by deconvolution of CD spectra, which demonstrated the presence of a low amount of α-helix and β-strands.
Potential partners of LOX-PP were screened by Surface Plasmon Resonance imaging (SPRi), SPR, and Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). We have identified 17 new partners of LOX-PP including four GAGs (chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate, hyaluronan), collagen I, cross-linking and proteolytic enzymes (lysyl oxidase-like 2, transglutaminase-2, and MMP-2), one proteoglycan (fibromodulin), one matricryptin (anastellin), and the ectodomain of one membrane protein (Tumor Endothelial Marker-8 also known as anthrax receptor-137).

Moreover, LOX-PP bound with very high affinity to tropoelastin and to plasminogen, and with high affinity to anastellin, a fragment of fibronectin (Table 3, Supplementary Fig. 8b).
 LOX-PP likely participates in collagen fibrillogenesis in association with fibromodulin, in fibronectin supramolecular assembly and in elastic fiber formation. Several LOX-PP partners such as fibrillar collagen I45, elastin10, fibronectin23, dermatopontin46,47, and fibromodulin48 bind to mature LOX, suggesting that both mature LOX and the propeptide are involved in ECM assembly and organization.
This suggests new roles for the propeptide in ECM assembly and cross-linking, cell-matrix adhesion, and in the regulation of EGF signaling pathways.
Due to the lack of electron density at the N terminus, the first 37 amino acids of FixK2(C183S)-His6 could not be modeled.
Residues that were not observed in the electron density map due to disorder include N-terminal residues 24–52 and C-terminal residues 144–161.

In aqueous solution, the classic 18.5 kDa isoform of MBP is primarily disordered, but has transient α-helices that are stabilized by membrane-mimetic conditions
, although the amphipathic α-helix represents the well-studied, canonical CaM-target, it has become recognized that CaM-binding sites and modes of interaction are quite diverse
These conditions were chosen to mimic the membrane environment of the myelin sheath, while keeping the system experimentally tractable to solution NMR methodology (7). We argue that 30% TFE stabilizes transient α-helices within the protein (83–85) on the basis of multiple, complementary studies on the immunodominant epitope of MBP

lines indicate a helices, random coil regions, and disordered residues, respectively
The crystal structure of NHBA133-427 was solved by molecular replacement (MR) at 1.8 Å resolution (Table 1), revealing a β-hairpin and a β-barrel encompassing residues 275–427
 In agreement with the fact that the N-terminal region of NHBA is predicted to lack secondary structures, and is thus annotated as an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), we were unable to solve the structures of this region.
The protein is connected to the membrane by a flexible linker, which leaves it mostly solvent exposed (10, 11).
We show that although the N terminus of NHBA is annotated as an intrinsically unfolded region by the most common prediction methods, the C terminus has all the features of an independently folded globular domain.
However, we realized very early on that the number of resonances present in the 15N-HSQC spectrum, which represents the protein fingerprint, contained at least 10–20% resonances more than expected, suggesting the presence in solution of different forms. Particularly diagnostic was, for instance, the resonance that resulted that corresponds to residue 287 (12.1 and 128.5 ppm), which was clearly doubled.
The  (HSQC) spectrum of CDC34C (Fig. 1a) shows a collapsed amide peak profile in the 1 H dimension, denoting that the protein assumes a disordered conformation with little regular secondary structure.
We also confirmed the disordered state of CDC34C using the chemical shift index for Cα , Cβ, CO, and Hα resonances.
To further support the disordered state for the C-terminus of CDC34, we utilized  (NOE) experiments.
Reduced 15N{1 H} NOEs were observed for residues
V101–N115 corresponding to the acidic loop in
CDC34. Several of these residues are not visible in
the crystal structure of CDC34.
MZF1 includes a novel N-terminal region that is 13 residues in length and shares no homology to any established protein interaction modules
Further inspection of the MZF1(1-128) spectrum identified ∼30 additional sharp
resonances clustered around the random coil chemical shift value of ∼8.2 ppm. The presence of these resonances only in the longer construct suggests that the novel N-terminal region is unstructured
As previously described, residues C-terminal from position 639 are disordered and were not included in the models [PDBs: 4KQ1, 4KQ2, 4KQM].
The structure exhibited defined electron density for residues 2–277; 283–401 and 415–639 in one monomer of the dimer and for residues 2–277; 283–401 and 415–626 in the other monomer. Both the monomers lacked interpretable electron density for the C-terminal 60–70 residues.
The structures for the basal state [PDB:3NAZ] and glucose-6-phosphate activated state [PDB:3NB0] of Gsy2p have been solved to 3.0 Å and 2.4 Å resolution, respectively, in two distinct crystal forms. In all cases, the subunits lack interpretable electron density C-terminal to residue 646.
Charge neutralization between phospho-Thr668 and regulatory arginines leads to inhibited conformation. Basal activity of R589A/R592A double mutant supports a locking strap from the N-terminal domain of a subunit and across the interface to the regulatory helix on the opposing C-terminal domain. Indeed, additional residues observed at C terminus of the activated structure are directed toward this regulatory interface.
Introduction of a single phosphothreonine at position 668 in the peptide-ligated construct inhibits the enzyme in a manner comparable to the in vitro phosphorylated wild-type enzyme.
The structures for the basal state [PDB:3NAZ] and glucose-6-phosphate activated state [PDB:3NB0] of Gsy2p have been solved to 3.0 Å and 2.4 Å resolution, respectively, in two distinct crystal forms. In all cases, the subunits lack interpretable electron density C-terminal to residue 646.
A 12-residue loop between these two helices (residues 401–412) is disordered in the basal state.
In both structures, the primary subunit interface is formed by a coiled-coil helical arrangement of helices α15 and α16 (residues 365–431). A 12-residue loop between these two helices (residues 401–412) is disordered in the basal state [PDB:3NB0] but becomes ordered [PDB:3NAZ] as the interface changes in response to glucose-6-phosphate binding.
the 13-residue insertion (residues 95–107) and the loop spanning residues 130–135. These loops are in fact very poorly defined in the NMR structural ensemble, with an average backbone RMSD (from the closest to mean NMR model) of 1.8 A˚ for residues 96–109 and 1.07 A˚ for residues 130–135. The poor definition
of the insert loop and the 130s loop  clearly arises from the near absence of long range NOE.
whereas the C terminus (residues 100–197) appeared disordered and collapsed, supporting the overall percentage of overall secondary structure obtained by CD deconvolution.
Thus, the NMR analysis confirms  both the computational and CD analyses that the Cwf10 NTE contains regions of disorder, most likely in the first 60 amino acids (Fig. 6A).
[Fragment: 1-236] Electron density is lacking for the N- and C-termini of both chains. Chain A accounts for residues 40-215 and chain B for residues 40-216. The crystal packing contacts allow sufficient space between adjacent stacked dimers to accommodate both N and C-terminal regions as a disordered array ... The visible N- and C- termini from each chain meet their counterparts near this rotational axis.
Arg-C generated immediate cleavage at Arg12 and Arg14 in both CCTsol and CCTmem, showing for the first time that the N-terminal 15 residues of CCT are not a part of a compact fold. Analysis of low mass peptides after chymotrypsin or Arg-C digestion indicated membrane enhanced access to the peptide backbone at positions Arg36, Leu41, Arg42, Tyr59, Arg61, Arg69, and Tyr80.
One explanation ... is that there is an interaction between residues Val274–Leu303 in domain M with residues Arg36–Arg69 in domain N in CCTsol, that protects these regions from protease cleavage. Upon membrane binding and dislocation of domain M, the sites in domain N become accessible ... We propose that the interaction of domain M with N contributes to autoinhibition of CCT in its soluble form.

The crystal packing contacts allow sufficient space between adjacent stacked dimers to accommodate both N and C-terminal regions as a disordered array ... The visible N- and C- termini from each chain meet their counterparts near this rotational axis.
CD analysis [of CCT-312 structure] showed a large increase in helical content (52 residues) induced by lipid micelles. These data suggest that in solution the dominant CCT-312 dimeric form has mostly disordered M domains and is refractory to crystallization and that only the tetrameric species with its ordered M domains was amenable to crystallization in the given condition.
To determine whether domain M undergoes a disordered to helix transition upon membrane binding in the context of the entire enzyme, we deconvoluted CD spectra ... We conclude that upon dissociating from membranes the equivalent of ∼58 amino acids converts from an alpha-helical structure probably to a mixture of other conformations. We are proposing that this conformational switch occurs in domain M.
A CCT-312(delta32) crystal ... was a dimer. The resolved portion of this dimer encompasses the catalytic domains and the AI segments of domain M. The segments linking the end of the alphaE helices to the AI helices are not resolved, which is indicative of their disorder ... Each AI helix ends in a sharp turn at [position] 294 (the AI-turn), which interacts with loop L2 at the mouth of the active site.
Chymotrypsin digestion proceeds from the more accessible C terminus,which was predicted to be loosely folded ... The molecular mass determinations for each fragment are considered accurate to within 1kDa. Given this error factor there are actually three possible cleavage sites for the 35-kDa fragment: Leu-299, Leu-303, and Leu-311.
The proline-rich C terminus of CT is predicted to be dominated by turns. This region contains several potential phosphorylation sites: for p34-cdc2 kinase and a site at Ser-362 for casein kinase II.
In vivo phosphorylation domain was identified using chymotrypsin proteolysis of wild-type CT ... Generated fragments of 40, 39, 35 and 28 kDa and a faint set of fragments of between 16 and 19 kDa ... reacted with an antibody against an N-terminal peptide, but not with an anti-C-terminal antibody ... indicate that the in vivo phosphorylation domain is restricted to the C-terminal ~7 kDa.
The amount of 32P associated with the CT band decreased with progressive deletion of the C-terminus ...  Deletion of the C-terminal 55 amino acids eliminated all 32p label. This result suggests that the C-terminal 55 amino acids constitute the sole phosphorylation domain in CT and that there are multiple sites of phosphorylation.
We anticipated that anisotropy would increase at each domain M site upon binding of CCT to lipid vesicles. Indeed, this was the case when the fluorophore was positioned at residue 245 in the polar and positively charged portion of domain M ... the N-terminal portion of domain M has less structure in the soluble form versus the membrane-bound form.
When the fluorophore was positioned at residue 245 at the N-terminus of domain M, the unfolding transition was characteristic of an intrinsically disordered segment. Moreover, there was a significant increase in anisotropy at this site upon addition of lipid vesicles, suggestive of an unfolded to folded transition.
The amino-terminal portion of the linker—including the Src SH3 docking site—is disordered in the present structure (residues 363–393)
The kinase activation loop adopts an inactive conformation in which it extends toward the FERM domain (near Ser46 in the F1 lobe) and is then unstructured between residues Asp573 and Leu584.

Protein crystallography, biophysical affinity determination and biomolecular simulations unanimously deliver a remarkable finding: a supramolecular "Janus" ligand can bind simultaneously to a flexible peptidic PPI recognition motif and to a well-structured adapter protein.
Upon binding to the rigid 14-3-3 protein, the recognition motifs undergo a disorder-to-order transition which might impose a specific functional fold of the IDP.
The crystal structure of the ternary complex between 14-3-3ζ, the Cdc25CpS216 peptide and CLR01 revealed that the molecular tweezer is bound to R208 of the Cdc25C peptide (R208Cdc25C).
Electron density was evident for residues 31–354 of both Rho protomers and for three RNA segments. The final model has been refined to 3.5 A ̊ resolution and shows good stereochemistry.
This movement is concomitant with a loss of interpretable electron density for the first 30 amino acids at the extreme N terminus, a highly variable and typically Arg/Gly-rich region of Rho orthologs.

This movement is concomitant with a loss of interpretable electron density for the first 30 amino acids at the extreme N terminus, a highly variable and typically Arg/Gly-rich region of Rho orthologs. Another difference is that the last 65 amino acids of the C-terminal domain are disordered and have been displaced in part by residues from the connector loop that links the N- and C-terminal domains.
Since Phe355 lies within the C-terminal region of Rho that is disordered in this crystal form, and since Rho411 retains length-dependent RNA-stimulated ATPase activity.
Trypsin cleavage before crystallization separates residues Ala31 to Arg102, which are poorly conserved and relatively unstructured, from the rest of the molecule, probably because this segment, which contains a heparan sulfate interaction site (23), is not firmly anchored.

Taken together, the crystallographic and NMR data suggest a structure for Rpn10 in which a compact VWA fold (residues 1–191) is connected via a long (approximately 16 amino acids), flexible linker to an extended α-helix that in solution does not interact with the VWA domain (Fig. 4C).

In human fibrinogen α chains, there are ten 13-residue repeats that are absent in chicken fibrinogen. The repeat region and the αC domain are mostly disordered and cannot be discerned in electron density maps.
The flexibly attached and mobile αC domains, which cannot be identified in electron density maps, are only ∼30% identical in the two species.
As was the case for native chicken fibrinogen, no resolvable electron density could be associated with αC domains.
There was no discernible electron density corresponding to the αC domains.
Beyond that, the lack of electron density for regions corresponding to the αC domains, often termed “free swimming appendages”, is further testimony to the mobile nature of these entities (46), elegant NMR studies showing some core structure notwithstanding (47, 48).
As such, it is not surprising that in this study no density was found that could be assigned to αC domains with any certainty.
The CD spectrum of the GCN4 fragment in buffered aqueous solution (pH 7.0) consists of a single negative absorption at 197nm, characteristic of a conformationally mobile species
Increased R1 and decreased R2 relaxation rates indicated increased mobility and structural disorder for about 12 and three residues at the N-terminus and C-terminus of the construct, respectively.
whereas the electron density of the anticipated C-terminal domain was undecipherable suggesting extreme disorder.

L20 shows a highly charged α-helical amino-terminal extension (aa 1–59) that contains clusters of conserved basic residues involved in RNA contacts in the ribosome.
Indeed, nuclear magnetic resonance studies have indicated that L20 extension is fully unstructured in the absence of its RNA target (Raibaud et al, 2002).
The residues 80–90 of Kap121p correspond to a loop connecting HEATs 2 and 3, which has no electron density in Kap121p–RanGTP complex. Truncation of this loop was vital to obtain crystals of Kap121p–cargo complexes, Kap121p–Nup53p complex, and unliganded Kap121p.
The residues 80–90 of Kap121p correspond to a loop connecting HEATs 2 and 3
The D2 domain contains two long loops: (L1) a long, ~100 amino acid (residues 328–424) loop that seems to adopt a mostly random coil conformation, within which residues 363–416 could not be modeled in the electron density maps and (L2) an ~30 amino acid loop (residues 575–601) that could not be modeled in the electron density maps

The D3 domain of ScNup192(2–960) has a globular shape composed of 15 helices (from α35 to α49) and includes two disordered loop regions (residues 799–813 between α41 and α42 [L3], and residues 850–856 between α44 and α45 [L4]).
All the selected IDRs lack α-helical structure in solution
However, the marginal secondary structure content suggests that all the peptides tested are IDRs.
Authors describe in figure 1 the different architecture of the crystalized proteins involved in the NPC, where they state residues 1-125 being unstructured.
The Nup84 NTD tightly interacts with the Sec13·Nup145C nucleoporin pair, and heterotrimer formation is independent of the unstructured N-terminal 124 residues, as well as the C-terminal 156-residue α-helical region of Nup145C.
Authors describe in figure 1 the different architecture of the crystalized proteins involved in the NPC, where they state residues 1-43 being unstructured.
Because the major part of the surface-exposed 1E1A and 5CD loops (residues 30–52 and 306–310) are invisible in the electron density, presumably due to disorder, these 2 regions were omitted from the final model.
Secondary structure predictions and limited proteolysis experiments suggest that the ≈55 N-terminal residues also are unstructured in the yeast Nup133 NTD. We refer to this 55-residue fragment (residues 1–55) as the N-terminal extension (NTE). Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we confirmed a random coil conformation of the Nup133 NTE.
"Further analysis revealed that an N-terminal Nup133 fragment containing only residues 1–15 was sufficient for complex formation with Nup120."
The PDB evidence shows this region lacks electron density, indicating it is disordered.
Circular dichroism spectra of
LOX-PP showed a single minimum near 200 nm, which is characteristic of an intrinsically disordered protein
(IDP) (Fig. 2a). Te content in secondary structure of LOX-PP was calculated by deconvoluting the spectra with
CONTIN-LL. Te content in α-helix and β-sheet was found to be 3.4% and 20.4% respectively, whereas the turn
content was 11.8%, and the disorder 64.5%.
To gain insight into the potential function of the hinge region we investigated a heterologous expressed peptide by CD and NMR spectroscopy. CD spectroscopy implies that the hinge region is intrinsically disordered. Resonance assignment was performed and allowed secondary structure analysis based on the chemical shift values. Seven amino acids in the N-terminal moiety show residual α-helical conformation.
The CD spectrum (Fig. 3 a) of the hinge peptide shows a negative minimum at 200 nm and a negative shoulder at about 220 nm at 5 °C that are characteristic for intrinsically disordered proteins (Kjaergaard et al., 2010).
(b) Monitoring the CD signal at 200 nm indicates that alterations in the CD spectrum are not due to unfolding. Temperature dependency of the CD signal at 220 nm is provided in the supplemental information (supplemental Fig. A1).
It was speculated that the hinge region might represent the trimerization domain of Col7 due to the presence of heptad repeats characteristic for coiled coil structures (McAlinden et al., 2003). However, CD spectroscopy clearly demonstrates that the hinge region does not adopt a coiled coil structure under the employed experimental conditions. Moreover, the CD-spectrum of the hinge region is typical for an intrinsically disordered protein. The negative shoulder at 220 nm can be interpreted as residual α-helical structure. This is in line with data obtained by NMR spectroscopy: (I) there is no signal dispersion observed in an 1H,15N-HSQC spectrum indicating the absence of secondary structure and (II) secondary structure prediction based on chemical shifts identified only seven amino acids (R24, L25, E27, T28, K32, A33, and S34) with dihedral angles corresponding to an α-helical conformation. The presence of residual secondary structure is commonly observed in disordered proteins (Dunker et al., 2002, Tompa, 2002).

CD spectroscopy implies that the hinge region is intrinsically disordered. Resonance assignment was performed and allowed secondary structure analysis based on the chemical shift values. Seven amino acids in the N-terminal moiety show residual α-helical conformation.
In the 1H,15N-HSQC of the hinge peptide the signals corresponding to the peptide backbone amide protons are not dispersed (Fig. 4). This lack of dispersion is characteristic for unfolded proteins. Resonance assignment of the backbone chemical shifts is nearly complete enabling determination of the secondary structure (Fig. 5 b)
For a patch of about 10 amino acids in the N-terminal moiety of the hinge peptide, the chemical shifts indicate an α-helical conformation for several amino acids. All other residues of the hinge peptide do not adopt neither α-helix nor β-strand conformation

Results state:
"Rotating around the pseudo-sevenfold axis of the propeller, a long disordered but conserved loop (DA34) follows strand 3D (Fig. 4 a, tube representation; and Fig. 4 c, sequence alignment)."
In the sequence alignment the beggining and end of the loop are stated.
The ECD of D. purpureum nicastrin (DpNCT; residues 19–611) yielded well-diffracting crystals in the space group P41212. The structure was determined by a combination of molecular replacement and bromide-based single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD). The atomic model was refined to 1.95-Å resolution. Residues 33–605 were assigned in the structure; 20 residues at the N and C termini are disordered in the crystals
Figure 1C,D show the CD spectrum of p14arf and its thermal denaturation, respectively. The shape of the spectrum is that typical of unstructured proteins, and the thermal denaturation profile suggests the absence of cooperative transitions from folded to unfolded species.
The longitudinal (R1), and transverse (R2) 15N-amide relaxation rates (Fig. 2B), the 15N-nuclear overhauser effect (NOE; Fig. 2C) and the neighbor-corrected secondary structure propensity values calculated from the backbone chemical shifts (Fig. 2D) all indicate that the C-terminal fragment 57–132 of p14arf is intrinsically unstructured and does not have any secondary structure propensity in solution.
Circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimetry shows that isolated peptides comprised of the A1 and H1 motifs (p14Arf 1−14 and Hdm2 240−254, respectively) are highly disordered in solution (Figure 1A and B, red and violet traces, respectively).
However, when combined, the components of the binary mixture self-assemble, forming β-strand-containing supramolecular structures of low solubility (Figure 1A and B, other traces). The appearance of a minimum in the CD spectra of the assemblies at 216 nm and the increase in ellipticity at 193 nm are consistent with the formation of β-strand-containing structures. 
When either peptide was titrated into a solution of the other, both NMR and CD spectra revealed that binding was saturable.

The appearance of a minimum in the CD spectra of the assemblies at 216 nm and the increase in ellipticity at 193 nm are consistent with the formation of β-strand-containing structures. 
Maximal β-strand character was observed when the molar ratio of A1:H1 was 1:1 (Figure 1A and B, green trace versus others). 
The solution of binary assemblies is characterized by visible turbidity and the disappearance of 1H NMR resonances that, before mixing, were observed for the monodisperse, free peptides (data not shown). When either peptide was titrated into a solution of the other, both NMR and CD spectra revealed that binding was saturable. 
Figure 3A shows that A1/H1 co-assemblies are networks of short, thin fibrils that are 10−20 nm long and less than 5 nm wide. These structures are morphologically similar to amyloid protofibrils derived from the β-amyloid peptide,24 insulin,23 lysozyme, 25 and an SH3 domain.
To test their stability and potential for further self-assembly, A1/H1 protofibrils were heated. The structure of A1/H1 co-assemblies became more organized after treatment (Figure 3B), appearing as distinct fibrils that were hundreds of nanometers in length. The long fibrils appeared to be bundled together into parallel, flat ribbons comprised of 3−6 individual fibrils.
A broad peak is observed in the chromatogram of a 1 : 2 mixture of NPM1-Nter:p14arf-NoLS, at a smaller elution volume than free pentameric NPM1-Nter. This peak has a calculated MW of 200–500 kDa, consistent with the formation of large aggregates, while the MW calculated on the peak of pentameric NPM1-Nter increases from 72 kDa to 95 kDa, suggesting that a complex could be formed between a NPM1 pentamer and several p14arf-NoLS peptides.
Under these conditions, small chemical shift variations were observed, together with an increase in line-width, indicative of an exchange between the free protein and the aggregated, high molecular weight complex, which could be mapped to the NPM1-Nter structure (Fig. 8B).
Analysis of smaller p14ARF peptides showed that residues 1–22 retained the ability to bind MDM2, whereas Tx–ARF23–44 and Tx–ARF56–64 showed no evidence of binding (Figure 1b, left).
MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates ubiquitination of p53/TP53, leading to its degradation by the proteasome.
Analysis of proteins containing amino-terminal p14ARF peptides showed that each protein that contained the first 22 amino acids localized to the nucleolus (Figure 2e–h,k,l). In contrast, constructs expressing p14ARF peptides that failed to interact with MDM2 (Tx–ARF35–64, Tx–ARF23–44 and Tx–ARF56–64) also failed to localize to the nucleolus (Figure 2i,j,m–p).
Expression of each of the amino-terminal Tx–ARF proteins that retained the ability to bind MDM2 and localize to the nucleolus also resulted in relocalization of MDM2 to the nucleolus (Figure 3e–h,k,l). MDM2 expressed with non-binding thioredoxin-p14ARF proteins (Tx–ARF35–64, Tx–ARF23–44 and Tx–ARF56–64) remained in the nucleoplasm, with evidence of nucleolar exclusion (Figure 3i,j,m–p).
MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 was efficiently inhibited by coexpression of full-length p14ARF (Figure 4a). Analysis of smaller regions of p14ARF showed that each amino-terminal p14ARF peptide that retained the ability to bind and relocalize MDM2 to the nucleolus inhibited the degradation of p53 (Figure 4a), although the smallest peptide (1–22) was reproducibly slightly less efficient than the full-length protein. In contrast, proteins containing p14ARF peptides that failed to bind MDM2 (Tx–ARF35–64 and Tx–ARF56–64) did not prevent MDM2-mediated degradation of p53 (Figure 4a). 
MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that mediates ubiquitination of p53/TP53, leading to its degradation by the proteasome. 
These experiments identified a sequence—between residues 83 and 101 within exon 2 of ARF—necessary for localizing ARF to the nucleolus.
The ARF85–101-GFP fusion protein exhibited significant accumulation both in the nucleoplasm and nucleolus (Figure 1Db and 1Dd), demonstrating that residues 85 through 101 are also sufficient for localizing a heterologous protein to the nucleus and nucleolus.
The p53 protein level was increased about 150% when cotransfected with an ARF-expressing plasmid (lane 2). However, when cotransfected with equal amounts of plasmid DNA expressing the exon 1β–encoded ARF N-terminal domain (lane 3) or tumor-associated ARFR98L (lane 4) and ARFR98Q (lane 5) mutant proteins, the level of p53, albeit still higher than that accumulated in the absence of ARF, is reproducibly half that seen with wild-type ARF cotransfection.
These results indicate that the ARF N-terminal domain is capable of inhibiting MDM2-mediated p53 degradation when overexpressed, but deletion or tumor-derived mutations in the exon 2 domain reduce ARF’s ability to stabilize p53. Hence, the full activity of ARF in stabilizing p53 requires both the N- and C-terminal domains.
Mutations in Exon 2 Reduce ARF’s Ability to Stabilize p53
ARF Colocalizes with MDM2 in the Nucleoplasm to Form Nuclear Bodies
The MDM2 and ARF nuclear bodies display identical punctate patterns, suggesting MDM2 and ARF colocalized in the nuclear bodies, which were not seen in control virus–infected cells (Figure 3C) or in ARF-negative (uninfected) cells in the same viewing field of Ad-E2F1-infected populations. 
p53 was also relocalized, from an even distribution in the nucleoplasm to colocalization with MDM2 and ARF in the nuclear bodies (Figure 3C, α-p53 staining).
RF-MDM2-p53 nuclear bodies were also observed in cells triply transfected with plasmid DNAs expressing each of the three proteins (Figure 4B, column 1).
Thus, both the MDM2-binding activity, encoded by the exon 1β, and the nucleolus-localizing activity residing in the exon 2 domain are important for ARF, p53, and MDM2 to form nuclear bodies.
The region with the highest mobility in TmrAB is indeed located in TM6 of TmrA right above the elbow helix and spans roughly 16 aa (residues 304–319). The weak electron density in this region, which includes a proline and glycine, reflects its high mobility.
The disordered amino acid residue stretch (217 to 232) is indicated with a dashed black line.
The human EJC core complex was reconstituted combining full-length MAGO bound to the RRM domain of Y14, full-length eIF4AIII bound to the SELOR domain of BTZ (full-length), a U15 RNA, AMPPNP, and magnesium ions.
The structure includes  two segments of BTZ comprising residues 169–194 and 216–248.
"After a disordered linker of about 20 residues, BTZ extends onto the first RecA-like domain."
Crystal that diffract to 3.2 Å resolution was obtained with the complex of Mago (full length), Y14 (66–174), eIF4AIII (full length), Btz (137–286), a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, and U15 RNA. The structure of the complex includes only two stretches of CASC3 (168–196, 215–230).
"The dotted line in red shows the approximate path of a portion of Btz not present in the electron density (residues 198–213"
The refined model consists of MAGO residues 4–146, Y14 residues 66–154, eIF4AIII residues 22–411, two segments of BTZ comprising residues 169–194 and 216–248, and the C-terminal region of UPF3b encompassing residues 418–432 (Fig. 1). Other portions of the proteins are not present in the structure, and are either poorly ordered or were separated upon proteolysis.

U1-70k contains an RBD between residues 100-180, whereas its N-terminal region (residues 1-100) has no known sequence motif.
The present model of the chymotrypsin-trimmed U1 snRNP (hereafter referred to as U1 snRNP) includes residues 1–164 of native U1 snRNA, a region covering the RRM and an N-terminal extension of the U1-70K protein (residues 34–183 out of 437 amino acids total), the N-terminal RRM of the U1-A protein (residues 1–114 out of 282 amino acids total) and the Sm folds with varying terminal appendices of all seven Sm proteins but lacks U1-C (see also Supplementary Figure S3 and Supplementary Table SI for protein residues included in the model).
In our structure, the electron density for the U1-70K N-terminal extension fades out beyond the centre of the Sm ring, indicating that the very N terminus of U1-70K is degraded or disordered.

Analysis of washed crystals revealed that a C-terminal RS-like region of U1-70K, a C-terminal RNA recognition motif (RRM) of U1-A, the U1-C protein as well as a C-terminal RG-repeat/Pro-rich region of Sm protein B were removed during the crystallization, while the RNA remained intact (Supplementary Figure S1).

For example, the alternative splicing factor ASF/SF2 binds to the RS-like domain of U1-70K (Xiao and Manley, 1997).
The C-tail (residues 326–377) is flexible and mainly composed of random coils in addition to one short strand β16 (residues 369–370), which is antiparallel to β3 in domain a, and two short 310 helices: η4 (residues 326–328) and η5 (residues 358–360) filling the cavity lined by helices α7 and α9 in domain b
The flexible C-tail (residues 351–372) becomes disordered with its electron density untraceable.
The movements of the C-tail and the b′ domain disrupt the interactions among domains a, b′ and the C-tail, favoring an open conformation, thus making the inner space of ERp44 more accessible to Prx4
varying regions (10–13 residues) are found to be disordered at the N-termini of different subunits indicating the flexibility of these ends.
In the
crystal structure of UBE2E1, most of the N-terminal
residues are missing, suggesting that they were
flexible (Fig. 2a) and analysis of the sequence using
IUPred indicates that they have features expected
for disordered regions.
In support of this, the N-terminal residues of UBE2E1 were sensitive to proteolytic cleavage.
and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (Fig. 2e)
showed that the mean residue ellipticity for E2E1full
is decreased relative to E2E1core. Notably, the mean
residue ellipticity at 208 and 222 nM is reduced by
~ 20% in the E2E1full spectra, consistent with the
absence of regions of α-helical and β-sheet structure
in the 40 N-terminal residues.
The N-terminal region of DDX3 (1–167) was presumed to be unstructured, and a circular dichroism (CD) analysis supports this prediction.
The
three-dimensional structure of Ubc1 was determined by NMR
spectroscopy using standard triple resonance and 15N-edited, 13C-edited, and methyl-specific NOE experiments. A family of
21 structures was chosen (Fig. 1) based on their low energy and
the absence of distance violations (Table I). The structure of
Ubc1 contains two individually well defined domains tethered
by a 22-residue linker.
The disordered regions correspond to residues 83–94 and 116–128 (α5–α6 loop).
Elevated R1 rates and lower 15N{1H} NOE values measured in the loop 83–94 show that nanosecond time scale internal motions are also present, suggesting that K7 has substantial flexibility in this region relative to other viral and cellular Bcl-2 proteins.
The disordered regions correspond to residues 83–94 and 116–128 (α5–α6 loop).
Cross peaks in the 1H–15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) for one of the regions in the protein (residues 116–128, α5–α6 loop) were relatively weak. In this region, peaks for residues F122, Q123, S124, L125 and I128 were missing from the spectra and could not be assigned, suggesting conformational exchange.
The NMR structure of K7 revealed considerable flexibility in the region 118–127, which is an α helix (α6) in all other known viral and cellular Bcl-2 proteins.
The hydrophobic binding pocket in K7 is bordered by the N terminus (Tyr7), α1, and the region 118–127, which is predominantly nonhelical but is labeled “α6” to remain consistent with the canonical Bcl-2 fold. Despite lacking secondary structure, the backbone in this segment is well ordered in electron density maps.
Nsa1 is suitable for a hybrid structural approach because it contains a well-structured WD40 domain followed by a functional, but flexible Cterminus
which is not amenable to X-ray crystallography methods. Following is a protocol for the cloning, expression, and purification of S.
cerevisiae Nsa1 for hybrid structural determination by X-ray crystallography and SAXS.
Since removal of the CTD moved the peak, this confirms that it is exclusively the CTDs (residues 107–171) that
contribute to this flexibility in solution. This result is in line with previous observations that the SSB CTD
has flexible properties

Residues 59–184 were observed in the electron density map, but two regions (residues 24–58 and 185–191) were disordered.
The CD spectra of both Ct tails are similar to each other and to those of other intrinsically disordered peptides
NMR of the monomeric FtsZ C-terminus demonstrates that it is intrinsically disordered
Here, we used solution NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the secondary structure of the monomeric FtsZ CTR. The two-dimensional 1H-15N (heteronuclear single-quantum coherence—HSQC) NMR correlation spectra of FtsZ CTR exhibits narrow chemical shift dispersion, typical of a disordered protein, suggesting a lack of structural order consistent with sequence-based predictions (Figure 1a). Furthermore, we assigned the 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shifts for FtsZ CTR and computed the secondary chemical shifts (ΔδCα–ΔδCβ), obtained by measuring the difference in the observed 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shifts and those predicted for a completely disordered structure. These secondary chemical shifts are mostly near zero for all residues, consistent with intrinsic disorder.
Taken together, our data suggest that FtsZ CTR is monomeric and remains mostly intrinsically disordered, although we observe two consecutive residues with strong signatures of partial α-helical conformations and prediction of a short, partially helical motif, amino acids 375 through 379, near the multiprotein interaction site that overlaps the C-terminal ClpX recognition site (amino acids 375–383).
1H-15N HSQC spectrum of FtsZ CTR is consistent with intrinsic disorder.
Secondary structure populations derived from the observed chemical shifts using the δ2D algorithm confirms the dominance of random coil (i.e., disordered) conformations
he CD spectra of both Ct tails are similar to each other and to those of other intrinsically disordered peptides
Consistent with the predictions from simulations, ultraviolet circular dichroism (UV-CD) measurements for the isolated CTT peptide indicate that it is conformationally heterogeneous
The spectrum of full-length FtsZ closely resembles that of the ΔCTT construct with a mixture of structures. The sum of the spectra for the core domain and the CTT does not reproduce the spectrum of a full-length protein. This suggests that the CTT likely undergoes conformational changes when it is tethered to the core domain by forming intermodule interactions with the core.
Swapping the 6-residue CTV from B. subtilis FtsZ with the 4-residue CTV from Escherichia coli FtsZ completely abolished lateral interactions between chimeric B. subtilis FtsZ polymers.
EM images of Bs FtsZ ΔC17 assembled in the presence of GTP indicate that it is almost exclusively in single-stranded protofilaments.
Under standard polymerization conditions, Bs FtsZ CTVE was able to form single-stranded polymers; however, no FtsZ filament bundles were observed (Fig. 3A). 
Data from Ec FtsZ CTVB indicates that the CTV from B. subtilis is sufficient to promote lateral interactions between single-stranded FtsZ polymers.
Our data suggest that CTV charge is the primary determinant of Bs FtsZ lateral interaction potential.
Analysis of Bs ftsZ CTVE mutants suggests that the lateral interactions we observed in vitro are critical for FtsZ ring integrity in vivo and support a role for the CTV in stabilizing FtsZ polymers within the cytokinetic ring. Although B. subtilis cells expressing Bs ftsZ CTVE grew normally and exhibited exclusively medial FtsZ rings (Fig. 5A), they were on average ∼85% longer than congenic wild-type cells (Fig. 5D). ∼31% (90 of 290) of Bs ftsZ CTVE mutants were filamentous (>5 cell lengths), suggesting that cells expressing the chimera failed to divide at a relatively high frequency.
Comparisons of cell length (L) with the number of FtsZ rings (R) indicated that the L/R ratio of the Bs ftsZ CTVE mutants was nearly 75% greater than wild-type cells.
Flexible region in the West Nile Virus NS1 protein, corresponds to a disordered loop which is also disordered in the DENV2 NS1 protein. Corresponds to an antigenic region containing a conserved hydrophobic WKxW motif
Each “wing” domain contains two glycosylation sites (Asn130, Asn175), an internal disulfide (Cys55-Cys143), and two discreet subdomains. An α/β subdomain (amino acids 38 – 151) comprises a four-stranded β-sheet, two α-helices and a disordered distal tip (amino acids 108 – 128; Fig. 1A, dotted line).
A 20-residue disordered region is indicated with dotted lines.
Ns1 disordered distal tip (amino acids 108 – 128) corresponds to 899-919 region of the West Nile virus (strain NY-99) polyprotein.
The region corresponds to a flexible and disordered region of the NS2B protein, which is an NS3 protease cofactor. This region can be crystallized in different conformations, or be missing from the electron densities
Residues 50 to 61 of NS2B form a tight complex with NS3, and it has been proposed that W61 is the last residue that is tightly bound to NS3, after which the rest of the residues (residues 62 to 88) are flexible and able to adopt multiple conformations (1). However, the structures of both DENV-1 protease and DENV-3 protease-aprotinin show that more residues (beyond W61) from NS2B are interacting with NS3 (up to T68 and E66 of NS2B, respectively). These results suggest that the conformational change to the closed form is a dynamic and iterative process.
The PDB shows the disorder region from 1645-1655 (NS3).
The protein was disordered in aqueous solu- tion, as indicated by a single minimum at about 198 nm in the CD spectra. The CD spectra remained unchanged when various concentrations of Fe3þ (4–40mM) were added (Fig. 3A).
we demonstrated that the non-tagged full-length soybean (Glycine max) ASR protein (GmASR) can bind Fe3þ , Ni2þ , Cu2þ , and Zn2þ . Natively disordered in aqueous solution, GmASR remained disordered in the presence of Fe3þ, but was found to aggregate in the presence of Zn2.

Fig. 6a shows the dimensionless Kratky plot, and as clearly visible, the profiles from the experiment and the simulation agree very well and display a random coil behavior, that is, a linear rise to a plateau at higher scattering angles.
The N-terminal 55 residues of ICP47 form a helical hairpin structure, which inserts into the opening between the two TM bundles. No density was observed for either the C-terminal 33 residues of ICP47 or the two TMD0s, indicating these regions are flexible in this conformation.
The 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of free DREB2A(255–272) showed limited dispersion in the proton dimension, indicating a lack of structure (Fig. 7A, black spectrum) (35). Consistent with this and with its far-UV CD spectrum (Fig. 6A), most residues have near-random coil secondary Cα chemical shifts (ΔδCα ≈0, Fig. 7D, top figure)
Experimental analysis for secondary structure content by far-UV CD indicated low α-helical contents of 12, 18, 10, and 13% in the ANAC013(254–274), DREB2A(255–272), COL10(175–208), and bZIP23(15–36) peptides, respectively
Using Far-UV CD, we found that the spectrum of the Dreb2a168–335 domain indicated a lack of secondary structure for this domain in solution. The negative maximum ∼200 nm implies an unstructured random coil conformation (Figure 1D).
We found that only the extended C-terminal domain, Dreb2a 168–335 which includes both the BD and the AD, interacted with Med25 551–680 with significant affinity. 
The spectrum of RCD1-RST(499–572) in complex with DREB2A(255–272) showed an absolute minimum shifted toward a higher wavelength compared with the theoretical spectrum. Moreover, the overall α-helical content in the complex was calculated to 39% compared with 31% in the theoretical complex. This indicated induction of structure upon complex formation (Fig. 6B).

The 1H,15N HSQC was dramatically changed upon addition of RCD1-RST(499–572) with a substantial increase in the 1H resonance dispersion (Fig. 7A, red spectrum). Furthermore, the Cα resonances for residues Val-261–Asp-267 experienced a significant downfield shift (ΔδCα >0), thus confirming the formation of an almost fully formed helical structure in this region (Fig. 7D, bottom figure) (34). Notably, the HSQC as well as the different triple resonance spectra lacked peaks for Phe-259 and Asp-260. This is consistent with the abolished binding of the F259A mutant (Fig. 2D; Table 3) and suggests that these residues are involved in the interaction.

The affinity of the interaction between RCD1-RST(499–572) and a short peptide of DREB2A, DREB2A(255–272), containing a predicted α-helix, was significantly lower, corresponding to a Kd of 117 nm, but with a large enthalpic contribution to binding of −51 kJ/mol (Fig. 2C).
When bound to RCD1-RST, DREB2A255-272 formed an a helix from V261-G270, with D260 forming an N-cap supported by the interaction between the residues in the N0-(F259) and N4-(L264) positions of the hydrophobic staple motif (Munoz et al., 1995) (Figure 2F).
The structure of bound DREB2A255-272 was solved using NMR data acquired with only DREB2A isotope labeled.

No density was observed for either the C-terminal 33 residues of ICP47 or the two TMD0s, indicating these regions are flexible in this conformation.
As observed for the DENV NS2B-NS3pro structure, in the absence of a substrate, the MVEV NS2B region beyond residue 69 is disordered. Upon the addition of a substrate, the C-terminal part of NS2B undergoes a dramatic conformational change, wrapping around the C-terminal barrel and forming a stabilizing β hairpin that inserts into the active site (2, 19, 47).
Regarding electron density, a total number of 580 out of 618 residues of full-length NS3 are well defined, together with 21 residues out of 45 of NS2B45. The 9 residues of the nonapeptide linker, 24 residues at the C terminus of the NS2B cofactor, 18 residues at the N terminus of the protease domain, and 7 residues in the linker region between protease and helicase are missing from the refined model.
The PDB shows disorder in the NS3 region 2085-2095 .
In general, disordered regions do not pellet after heating while structured regions tend to unfold upon boiling and
aggregate upon cooling, causing them to be found in the pellet after centrifugation. ... In contrast, the C-terminal fragment (His6-Pan1 1191–1480) did not pellet after boiling, consistent with the unstructured prediction from the PONDR analysis.
The Pan1 N-terminal fragment (amino acids 230–700) exhibited the typical CD spectrum for a-helices, with peaks at 222 and 208 nm, while the CD spectrum of the C-terminus (amino acids 1191–1480) indicated that this region is mostly random coil.
This region corresponds to the KDM5A PHD1 domain. "This ‘palm’ region is flanked by a ‘fingers’ region composed of the ARID domain. The PHD1 domain, which is disordered in the structure, may also be part of this region."
This region also corresponds to the KDM5A PHD1 domain, which is disordered in this structure too as in 5CEH
This region is reported to be unstructured and not very prone to α-helix induction.
Similar to DREB2A(255–272), free ANAC013(254–274) and ANAC046(319–338) had poorly dispersed HSQC spectra (Fig. 7, B and C, black spectra), and ΔδCα values close to zero (Fig. 7, E and F, top figures) again confirming a lack of preformed structure.
In support of this, no indications of transiently formed structure were apparent from the secondary Cα chemical shifts (Fig. 7F, top figure) or AGADIR predictions (Fig. 5A) for ANAC046. 
Comparison of the HSQC spectra of free and bound ANAC013(254–274) and ANAC046(319–338) confirmed their interaction with RCD1-RST(499–572) (Fig. 7, B and C), but in contrast to those of DREB2A(255–272), the dispersion in the proton dimension appeared immediately unaffected. 
The ANAC046(319–338)·RCD1-RST(499–572) complex had an overall α-helical content of 38%, compared with 34% in the theoretical complex. However, in this case a shift toward a lower wavelength in the complex was observed (Fig. 6D). Together, the results suggested that complex formation involving ANAC046(319–338) and ANAC013(254–274) resulted in structure induction, although to a lower degree than that of the DREB2A(255–272)·RCD1-RST(499–572) complex.
Here, based on the CSPs, we observed binding in the region of M315 to S338, indicating a localized C-terminal interaction occurring at the same binding site at which ANAC046 interacts with radical induced cell death1 (RCD1) [43].

We saw a small, 1.5 Å reduction in Rh upon calcium binding to ANAC046 (Figure 4B), which agrees with the identified site of interaction at the C-terminus.
These data suggest that in some cases, the position of the Ca2+-binding site can affect the extension of the IDP by inducing a conformational shift, seen here for both NHE1 and ANAC046.
Although authors and additional data of the paper indicate that the conformational transition (compaction) locates at the C-terminus of ANAC046, provided data do not allow to establish sequential boundaries for the conformation transition. Therefore, this evidence corresponds to the full-length protein version used for the experiment. 
Cyclin D1 is known to contain 2 Rb binding sites (17) comprised of an N-terminal LxCxE consensus motif and a peptide recruitment site. The cyclin D1 structure exhibits N-terminal disorder, so the LxCxE motif cannot be visualized.
This region contains the LxCxE that binds to the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor
Crystal diffracting was obtained with a shorter fragment, comprising residues 88-530.
"The refined model comprises residues 89–509 of karyopherin α, 140 water molecules, and a cobalt ion, while the 20 carboxy-terminal residues are disordered and not modeled."

The structure of activated c-Kit kinase was determined (residues 544–935). This structure contains two c-Kit enzyme molecules in the asymmetric unit and clear electron density was observed for residues 566–935.
"The amino-terminal ∼20 amino acid residues of both enzymes are disordered"
The IDD spectrum is quite different: the single negative maximum at 200 nm indicates that this domain contains long completely unfolded regions, and moreover, the overall low signal intensity suggests that β-strands are present in insignificant amounts judging from the form of the curve.
The central and C-terminal domains of coilin have fluorescence maxima at 350 nm for IDD and 354 nm for CTD, which indicates an even greater level of hydrophilicity in the local tryptophan environment.
Truncation and mutagenesis analyses clearly showed that the binding affinity of Atg7 for Atg8 is predominantly provided by the C-terminal tail of ECTD, especially by residues 618–630, which were observed in our NMR structure but disordered in the crystal structure.

The rms deviations of backbone and all heavy atoms over residues 212–281 of the CAP-Gly-2 domain and residues 448–451 of the peptide are 0.13 and 0.51 Å, respectively. The rest of the peptide residues are disordered even in complex with the CAP-Gly-2 domain.

The calculated structural ensemble (Figure 3a) exhibits a backbone r.m.s.d. of 0.62 Å for the structured 51Z2 region (residues 80 to 140 of the full length E6) while the backbone r.m.s.d. drops to 2.37 Å when including the less ordered E6 C-terminus (residues 141–151, numbering according to full-length sequence). This C-terminus gave rise to only few NOEs consistent with a less ordered organization.
An interaction is observed, as several chemical shifts of amide groups arising from the C-terminus of 51Z2 were perturbed in presence of hDlgPDZ2 (Figure 4a). Surprisingly, the perturbation affected the C-terminal nine E6 residues (143 to 151), more than anticipated from either the canonical PDZ-BM or from the already published hDlgPDZ2-E6 peptide complex structures [52], [53]. Importantly, no further E6 resonances experienced chemical shift perturbation, clearly indicating that the interaction with the hDlgPDZ2 is confined to the disordered C-terminal region harboring the PDZ-BM of HPV51 E6.
The malleability of E6 is reminiscent of intrinsically disordered proteins that undergo a disorder-to-order transition upon productive complex formation with specific ligands [67].

The SPR data indicate a contribution to binding of the additional residues as the E6CT11 binds with higher affinity to hDlgPDZ2 than the E6CT6 (Kd 9.6 µM versus 28.3 µM, respectively; Figure 5).

Both N-terminal (amino acids 1–18) and C-terminal (amino acids 105–116) regions are flexible ... This observation is consistent with the 15N-{H} NOE and 15N backbone relaxation data.
A more disordered region, consisting of 13 residues (amino acids 31–44) between beta2- and beta3-strands, connects front side and back side beta-sheets of the protein.
Both N-terminal (amino acids 1–18) and C-terminal (amino acids 105–116) regions are flexible ... This observation is consistent with the 15N-{H} NOE and 15N backbone relaxation data.
The autors state that C-terminus flexibility is important for protein binding. In order to demonstrate this, they generate a C-terminus mutant of the protein which in fact has restricted flexibility. It is important to point out that they demonstrate that this conformational change has an important impact in vitro (the oligomeric specie is not formed) and in vivo (compromised cell viability).
The conformational flexibility of the C-terminus of histone H4 promotes histone octamer and nucleosome stability and yeast viability
C-terminal tail of histone H4 in the nucleosome folds back over α3 of H4 and that residues 96–99 of H4 form a two-stranded parallel β sheet with residues 100–103 of histone H2A. However, in complex with Asf1, α3 in the H4 C terminus terminates one turn earlier than in the nucleosome and extends 180° in the opposite direction so that residues G94–L97 can form the anti-parallel β sheet and insert into the core of Asf1
the H4 C terminus rotates almost 180° to form an anti-parallel β sheet with strand β9 of Asf1 (Figure 4). This raises the intriguing possibility that the C terminus of H4 can act as a handle for chromatin disassembly
The terminal 15 residues are disordered
The authors refers to the 80-98 region of this Uniprot, which has an extra methionine as a first residue, unlike the peptide they assessed.
In the first of these mutants the disordered C-terminal, residues 79-97 were deleted (Δ79-97 mutant), and in the second mutant residues 62-97, which comprises the last three helical turns of helix 3, were deleted. Both C-terminal deletions abolished the assembly activity (Fig 6).

The 1H,15N-HSQC spectrum of 15N-13C-labeled STAT6783–814 (SI Fig. 1) shows narrow dispersion of signals in both proton and nitrogen dimensions indicating that the peptide adopts an unstructured conformation in absence of the binding partner.
Altogether, the NMR structure indicates that the coactivator recognition mechanism by STAT6 occurs by the formation of a complex in which two folded regions are connected by a linker that adopts an extended conformation
The NMR structure of the NCoA1257–385/STAT6783–814 complex (PDB ID: 5NWM), is of high quality (Table SI 4).
the NMR structure indicates that the coactivator recognition mechanism by STAT6 occurs by the formation of a complex in which two folded regions are connected by a linker that adopts an extended conformation.
In this crystal structure the residues located in the N-terminal part (Gly783 - Pro793) are not ordered indicating that this region is too dynamic to be resolved in the crystal (SI Fig. 3).
A subset of STAT6783–814 backbone amide resonances becomes well dispersed in the presence of the binding partner (Fig. 3A). These changes are indicative of a well-structured region within the bound STAT6783–814 peptide.
Regarding the STAT6783–814 peptide in the bound form, the analysis from chemical shifts, 3JHNHα couplings and the relative weight of interresidual NOEs (Fig. 2C) suggests that the STAT6783–814 peptide presents a flexible N-terminal tail, followed by an α-helix in the region Ile786-Ile790 whose population increases from around 10% in the free form to close to 100% upon binding to NcoA1 PAS-B (Fig. 2C) (SI Fig. 9). Then a short extended linker follows and finally the second α-helix (Glu799-Glu808) (Fig. 2A,B) whose population increases from 30% to close to 100%.
Given that existing prestructured motifs are enhanced in the bound form, the data suggest that the recognition of the coactivator by STAT6 occurs by a conformational selection25 mechanism regarding the secondary structure.

Given that existing prestructured motifs are enhanced in the bound form, the data suggest that the recognition of the coactivator by STAT6 occurs by a conformational selection25 mechanism regarding the secondary structure.
A sequence in the C-terminus of arrestin termed the “C-tail” (residues 385–393 of arrestin-3) ... In basal arrestins, the C-tail is anchored to the N-domain. Receptor binding induces release of the C-tail, which becomes unstructured.
Perturbation of either the polar core or the C-tail shifts the arrestin equilibrium to favor activation, suggesting that the inter-domain arrangement changes during activation. The binding sites for clathrin and clathrin adapter AP-2 are localized in the C-tail of non-visual arrestins, and both become fully accessible upon C-tail release.
Similar to Sumo-1, the data indicated that the first 23 residues at the N-terminus were disordered.
Unstructured in aqueous solution but adopts a helical conformation at the presence of 30% TFE. NMR data are only available for the structure in 30% TFE solution (PDB:1Y32).
In the absence of TFE, the CD spectrum shows strong negative dichroism below 200 nm, indicative of a small degree of ordering in the peptide. On addition of TFE, changes diagnostic of conformational equilibrium between unordered structures and helical conformations of humanin in solution take place in the CD spectra.
The secondary structure of IKKγ is shown above the residues, where dark blue arrows indicate α helices and dashed dark blue lines indicate disordered regions
The secondary structure of IKKγ is shown above the residues, where dark blue arrows indicate α helices and dashed dark blue lines indicate disordered regions.
suggesting that the 44–111 region could be disordered, in a different conformation, or masked in the absence of IKK. Although we have no direct experimental evidence in support of any of these models, our NMR data on NEMO 44–111 do support the model that this region of NEMO becomes ordered in the presence of bound IKK peptide
Proteins starting at residue 1 produced NMR spectra with ∼40 very intense crosspeaks with poor dispersion (data not shown), whereas proteins starting at residue 44 did not display this characteristic. This finding was attributed to a disordered N terminus of ∼40 residues; therefore, residue 44 was selected as the N-terminal start site for crystallization constructs.

Lack of electron density for the CSN5 portion consisting of residues 197–219 [corresponding to Ins-2 in the structure of associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM (signal transducing adapter molecule) deubiquitinase (AMSH-LP)]
prevented accurate modeling and analysis of this segment.
VP16 was shown before to be unstructured in solution (16, 32, 33). We confirm this notion by the absence of NOE contacts that are indicative for secondary structure elements.
The (1H,15N)-HSQC spectrum of VP16ad shows a small dispersion of intense signals in the proton dimension (<1 ppm), indicative for a lack of secondary structure.
HSV-1 VP16 amino acid sequences of the KOS and F strains are identical for all 490 residues and differ from strain 17 by only two amino acid substitutions (Asp-Asn at position 13 and Ala-Thr at position 124).
NMR structural studies demonstrate that VP16C is disordered in the free state, and forms a 9-residue α-helix involving residues Asp472 to Thr480 in complex with Tfb1.

The α and β 13C chemical shifts analysis revealed that the segment connecting the WW2–WW3 pair (residues 400–480) lacks elements of a secondary structure in both the free and bound conformations, and is unaffected by binding of the Smad3 peptide.
The 80-amino-acid region connecting the WW2 and WW3 domains
The 18 N-terminal amino acids for which electron densities are not observed in the SUMO-1–TDG crystal have been shown to be flexible in unconjugated SUMO-1 in solution
SUMO-1 contains an N-terminal extension, which forms a flexible appendix that protrudes from the core protein
...However, only 34 NOEs could be used to characterize the flexible termini (Gly2 to Glu18 and Gln94 to Val101),
The final model contained SUMO1(19–97)-AMSN, SAE1 amino acids (aa) 9–180 and 205–345, and UBA2 aa 5–217, 235–291, 305–548 and 608–640. As full-length proteins were used in crystallization, residues not observed in electron density were presumed disordered.
We observed that the Swr1 subunit uses the intrinsically disordered Swr1-Z domain to specifically recognize H2A.Z-H2B through interac- tions between the LxxLF motif of the Swr1-Z domain and the hydrophobic residues in the aC helix of H2A.Z. Mutation of
the hydrophobic residues in the LxxLF motif or deletion of the Swr1-Z domain leads to slow-cell-growth phenotype in the presence of caffeine.
Here, we report the structure of IQ peptides (24aa) of Nm/Ng complexed with CaM and their functional studies with full-length proteins. Nm/Ng and their respective IQ peptides are intrinsically unstructured; however, upon binding with CaM, IQ motifs adopt a helical conformation. Ser41 (Ser36) of Nm (Ng) is located in a negatively charged pocket in the apo CaM and, when phosphorylated, it will repel Nm/Ng from CaM.
The spectra for 3D7-6H under all conditions examined are remarkably similar, showing a single minimum at approximately 198 nm, indicative of a largely unstructured protein
One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of MSP2 under both physiological and acidic conditions show typical characteristics of an unstructured protein,
The CD spectra of both monomeric and polymeric 3D7 MSP2 are dominated by an ellipticity minimum at ~210 nm, indicating a high content of random coil
Furthermore, the axial ratio (a/b) of 17.2, calculated from the sedimentation coefficient and monomeric molecular mass assuming a prolate ellipsoidal shape (Table 1), indicates that the 3D7-6H monomer is significantly elongated in solution
The H2A.Z.1 and H2A.Z.2 L1 loop regions are flexible.
Region 39-39 of H2A.V correlates with the canonical loop 1 of the H2A and H2B protein family.
([Pubmed ID: 23002134]: Furthermore, contacts between the H2A L1 loops of the two H2A–H2B dimers stabilize their association within the nucleosome)

The most striking difference between free (Whitby et al., 1998) and complexed NEDD8 is the C-terminal tail (Figure 5B), which rotates 30  about Leu69 to form the complex. Complex formation induces order in the C-terminal 3 residues, which are disordered in free NEDD8. The C-terminal tail adopts an extended strand-like conformation as it docks into the nucleotide binding pocket in UBA3.

"Both clathrin and AP-2 α-appendage bind to a disordered region (designated LC) located between the SH3 and PX domains. The binding of the α-appendage was stronger to the SH3LC construct than to full-length SNX9, and clathrin-binding was only detectable with the SH3LC construct (see also Fig. 2A), suggesting that the binding sites for clathrin and AP-2 is obstructed in full-length SNX9."
Of the 993 residues in PTEX150, S668−D823 are well-resolved in the structure, and form a hook with a shaft. [..] The remaining 80% of PTEX150—not visible in our structures—is predicted to be intrinsically disordered [..] suggesting that this 80% of the protein is too mobile to be observed and may be flexibly arranged outside the stable PTEX core.

Note: AMBEXP due to resolution (4.16 Å).

We were unable to obtain high-quality crystals of full-length APPBP1-UBA3-NEDD8. Thus, we tested deletions lacking sequences disordered in previous apo APPBP1-UBA3 crystals (12646924). Mutants lacking UBA3’s N-terminal 11 or C-terminal 92 residues formed soluble complexes; further deletions led to aggregation. [curator NOTE: In the PDB, there are missing coordinates for the first 32 amino acids. Extended IDR?]

The SNX18 WDDEW motif found to interact with LC3/GABARAP is a noncanonical motif because of the presence of the W and several acidic residues, and the lack of the hydrophobic residue in the L position.
Interestingly, this motif is also required for the SNX18 interaction with AP-1, an adaptor protein implicated in autophagosome biogenesis from the trans-Golgi network (Guo et al., 2012).
The interaction site was mapped to the SNX18 SH3-LC region (Fig. 7 A) and the exact sequence was determined by a peptide array covering the entire SNX18 SH3-LC sequence, where GST-GABARAP bound to all peptides containing 154-WDDEW-158 (Fig. 7 B), the same motif previously found to mediate binding of SNX18 to AP-1 (Håberg et al., 2008).
In summary, SNX18 interacts with Atg8 proteins through a WDDEW sequence in its SH3-LC region, and this interaction is required for localization of GFP-LC3 to SNX18-induced tubules and for GFP-LC3 spot formation.

Whereas MxiM requires the presence of a detergent ligand to form a folded structure, PilP has a folded domain, which requires no ligand for formation, but has significant portions of the structure in an unfolded state, particularly within the N terminus.
Limited digestion with chymotrypsin was found to yield a stable fragment; peptide sequencing was used to identify the N terminus, which starts from Glu69, and mass spectrometry demonstrated that the C terminus of the protein was not cleaved (data not shown).
The C-terminus is unstructured even if it was not mentioned in the text.

The majority of potential trypsin and V8 protease cleavage sites are highly protected within a core region spanning residues 64-150, indicating that this part of the protein represents a core, folded domain.

We were unable to detect microtubule associations of single molecules of GFP-PRC1-NS at the concentrations needed to resolve single molecules using TIRF microscopy (<10 nM; data not shown), suggesting that residues in the C terminus domain contribute to microtubule binding
The main chain atoms of most of the N-terminal 486 residues in PRC1-NSΔC could be assigned, except the C-terminal 36 residues that were disordered in the crystal and not included in the final model.
[..] the per-residue chemical shift deviation of HET-S shows that it is composed of an N-terminal mostly helical structured domain comprising at least residues 13–222 followed by an unstructured and flexible C-terminal tail.
Note: Evidence also found in Supplementary Figures S2b and S3.

Because con-Pr1, -Pr2, and -Pr3 all shared common characteristics of conantokins, we hypothesized that they would be structurally related to con-G, which adopts an α-helical conformation in solution in the presence of divalent cations. However, it is nearly structureless in the absence of divalent cations (22). To estimate the α-helical content of the C. parius conantokins, circular dichroism spectroscopy was employed. The α-helical content of con-Pr1 and -Pr2 was estimated to be much greater in the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ than in the absence of divalent cations, like con-G (Fig. 3).
con-Pr1 is unstructured in the absence of divalent cations, i.e. Mg2+ and Ca2+.

The final electron density map showed continuous density except for a disordered region between residues 36 to 80. 
Note: When co-crystalized with ATP this region remains disordered (PDB:4B0S). However, when crystalized with ADP it is found disordered (PDB:5LRT, Pubmed: 28119453) or ordered (PDB:4B0T) possibly due to different conditions.
The 􏱁- and 􏱂-domains are structurally autonomous whereas the 􏱃-domain is proteolytically sensitive and presumably unstructured in the absence of other divisomal proteins.
Note: See also Figure 1.
the electron density for the C-terminal residues of Cnm67 (residues His-574—Lys-581) is largely missing. Lys-581 is the C-terminal residue in Cnm67. [Note: they are afterwards demonstrated as disordered residues]
Collectively, the experimental evidence suggests that without its hydrophobic terminus, the seemingly very tight Cnm67 globular dimer (with >4000 Å2 buried!) unfolds and aggregates. The likeliest explanation for this is that the C-terminal residues function as a cover or clamp for a large hydrophobic patch that is evident at the tip of the globular domain adjacent to the dimer interface (Fig. 7A).
Residues 67–81 did not exhibit defined electron density, suggesting that the C-terminal segment is disordered in solution.
The crystallographic B-factors of loop Ω1 are high as compared with those for the other regions, suggesting its flexible nature (Fig. 3d). As having been speculated for other START domains with such a flexible Ω loop, the loop Ω1 of Ups1 may function as a lid that regulates lipid binding to the pocket (see below).

As having been speculated for other START domains with such a flexible Ω loop, the loop Ω1 of Ups1 may function as a lid that regulates lipid binding to the pocket (see below).
Deletion of the Ω1 loop (ΔLid) also completely impaired the PA transfer activity of Ups1–Mdm35. These results indicate that conserved basic residues at the bottom and near the entrance of the pocket and the Ω1 lid play essential roles in the PA transfer activity of Ups1–Mdm35.
Electron density for the first 12 or 13 residues was not observed in all cases, because of disorder.
Consistent with their proposed functions, both the regulatory loop and the C-terminal region were predicted to exhibit significant polypeptide backbone flexibility, a structural feature corroborated by specific B factors from the x-ray data.
Examination of the PITP structure reveals that the intervening residues 119–190 form an extensive loop region between strands 7 and 8. Postulating that this loop is likely required for the association of PITP with a wide variety of lipid- and protein-modifying enzymes, we refer to this region as the regulatory loop.
two distinct forms of PITP exist: (1) a “closed” loaded PITP. form in which the PC lipid is buried within the structure and (2) an “open” lipid-free form in which the phosphoIntroduction lipid-binding cavity is opened up and the lipid-exchange loop is swung away from the body of the structure. [The mostly disordered loop acts as a lid]
Consistent with their proposed functions, both the regulatory loop and the C-terminal region were predicted to exhibit significant polypeptide backbone flexibility, a structural feature corroborated by specific B factors from the x-ray data. The relative instability of portions of this helix is supported by the high B-factors calculated for residues 243–250
It seems that the interaction with lipid vesicles induce a conformational change of the C-terminus domain (helix), which adopts flexible conformation (not described, maybe a partial unfolding). This conformation allows the cleavage by trypsin in arg 253 and 259. This process is needed to extract the lipid from the vesicle.
Solving the structure of the two peptides resulted in an ensemble of outstretched coil structures in the case of AmVg(358–392) (Fig. 6A), whereas that for NvVg(351–385) contains a helix between residues 371 and 377
NvVg(335–372), with its C-terminus located where the helix occurs in the shorter peptide, shows marked changes, with an attenuation of its NOE pattern. Moreover, the changes are visible in the spectrum as a collapse of the signals. The corresponding CD spectra also indicate a random coil.

A) Domain organization of hPrp28. The 100 kDa hPrp28 contains three domains: disordered domain (residues 1–257, green), DEAD box domain (residues 410–642, orange), and HELICc domain (residues 678–759, red). Residues 1–138 comprise the RS domain of hPrp28.
(B) Mass spectrometric (MS) determination of phosphorylation sites within the
N-terminal RS domain of hPrp28 in native U5 snRNP (square) and functional
spliceosomal B complex (circle).
 Here, we analyzed the phosphorylation sites of hPrp28 in U5 snRNPs and assembled B complexes by mass spectrometry. The analysis identified serine residues at positions 14, 23, 38, 39, 41, 65, 67, 106, 107, 109, as well as T25, to be phosphorylated in both complexes (Figure 8B; Table S3). Phosphorylation at S16
and S63 was found only in U5 snRNP.

The final hPrp28ΔN model consists of residues 352–806, five sulfate
ions, two glycerol molecules, 3-cyclohexyl-1-propylsulfonic acid, one disordered Hg atom and 220 solvent molecules. Missing residues, namely the N-terminal residues 338–351, loops 695–702 and 724–727 and the C-terminal residues 807–
820, resulted from non-interpretable electron density and are most likely to be disordered. 
Two loop regions (residues 695–702 and 724–727) as well as the N-terminal residues 338–351 and the C-terminal residues 807–820 are not defined in the electron-density map and are most likely to be disordered.
The Electron Microscopy structure of the Precusor of Human Pre-catalytic Spliceosome (pre-B complex), shows this region of the Probable ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX23 (alternative name Prp28) lacks electron density, indicating it is disordered.

Our high-resolution map enabled us to place not only the RecA1 and RecA2 domains but also the N-terminal region of Prp28 (Prp28-N) (Fig. 3 and fig. S5C).

Electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstructions of type-II PKA-AKAP18γ complexes reveal hetero-pentameric assemblies that adopt a range of flexible tripartite configurations. Intrinsically disordered regions within each PKA regulatory subunit impart the molecular plasticity that affords an ∼16 nanometer radius of motion to the associated catalytic subunits.
conformational plasticity observed in these analyses is facilitated by this intrinsically disordered region between residues 44 and 90 of RIIα, a linker that connects the AKAP docking site to the cAMP-responsive transduction domains. This notion is substantiated by a primary sequence analysis of RIIα orthologs, showing that the linker regions are of similar length but exhibit low amino acid identity
Our observation of very narrow 1H chemical shift dispersion of merely 0.9 ppm (7.7–8.6 ppm) in the 15N-HSQC spectrum of LANA C-terminal fragment (residues 1110–1162) indicates that this region is unstructured (Figure S1A).
The structure reveals that the viral peptide establishes a two-strand inter-molecular antiparallel β-sheet with the protein.
We thus constructed a BRD4 ET domain fused at its N-terminus to LANA comprising residues 1110–1162 via a flexible linker (GSGSGS), and determined by NMR analysis that the minimal ET binding site in LANA is confined to residues 1131–1149 (NLQSSIVKFKKPLPLTQPG) (data not shown). Notably, the 15N-HSQC spectra of the ET domain displayed nearly identical protein backbone resonance perturbation patterns induced by adding a LANA segment consisting of residues 1110–1162 or 1131–1149 (Figure S1A), or a LANA peptide of residues 1133–1144 (Figure 1B, red vs. blue signals), thereby defining the ET domain binding site in LANA to residues 1133–1144. We further determined binding affinity of the ET domain to the LANA peptide by NMR titration to be approximately Kd = 635 μM (Figure S1A).
This poly-E region is inferred by the curator to be disordered, based on MobiDB-Lite and according to experimental evidence demonstrating that poly-E repeats display random-coil-like conformation (PMID:16949547)

An N-terminal, 830-residue Intrinsically Disordered Region of the Cytoskeleton-regulatory Protein Supervillin Contains Myosin II- and F-actin- Binding Sites
Here, we utilize Circular Dichroism (CD) and bioinformatics sequence analysis to demonstrate that the N-terminal part of supervillin forms an extended intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Our combined data indicate that the N-terminus of human and bovine supervillin sequences (positions 1–830) represents an intrinsically disordered region, which is the largest IDR known to date in the villin/gelsolin family. Moreover, this result suggests a potentially novel mechanism of regulation of myosin II and F-actin via the intrinsically disordered N-terminal region of hub protein supervillin.
Major cytoskeletal interactors, including filamentous actin and myosin II, bind within the unique supervillin amino terminus, amino acids 1-830.
Here, we present CD spectra and bioinformatics analyses to show that this region of supervillin is predominately disordered in the unbound state.
Furthermore, the incidence of charged side chains within residues 1–830 is also somewhat higher in the N-terminus of supervillin than in its C-terminus or in villin and gelsolin. These hydrophobicity-charge features of the supervillin N-terminus are typical for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP), which lack the capacity to fold in an aqueous solvent
This N-terminal disordered region of bovine supervillin interacts with at least 17 proteins.
Based on the disordered nature of the N-terminus, we can propose certain features of the mechanisms of binding of F-actin and myosin II by supervillin. Its sequence M binds the S2 fragment of nonmuscle and smooth muscle myosin II, whereas fragments A1, A2 and A3 bind F-actin
Our CD data indicate that the first 342 residues of supervillin form an intrinsically disordered region. The complementary bioinformatics analysis suggests that the entire N-terminus of supervillin likely represents a large IDR.
Minimal sequences required for the binding to myosin II are supervillin amino acids 11-174 and sequences within myosin subdomain S2.
Supervillin sequences capable of binding to actin filaments include a site near the C terminus of SV-(171-342), the N terminus of SV-(343-571), and the C terminus of SV-(570-830) (Fig. 2C).
Similar amounts of co-sedimentation with F-actin were observed for SV-(343-571) as for SV-(171-342) and SV-(570-830) (Fig. 2A), each of which contains a single C-terminal actin-binding site (Fig. 2C).
F-actin binds independently and directly to three regions of supervillin (SV-(171-342), SV-(343-571), and SV570-830)).
Overexpression of supervillin amino acids 1-174 in COS7 cells disrupted the localization of myosin IIB without obviously affecting actin filaments. Taken together, these results suggest that supervillin may mediate actin and myosin II filament organization at cholesterol-rich membrane domains.

Crystal structures of a truncated form of hUGDH (residues 1–467) were determined (Table 1) because crystallization of the full-length enzyme (residues 1–494) had failed. 
Here we show that the entropic force produced by an ID carboxy-terminus (ID-tail) shifts the conformational ensemble of human UDP-α-D-glucose-6-dehydrogenase (hUGDH) toward a substate with a high affinity for an allosteric inhibitor.
The function of the ID-tail does not depend on its sequence or chemical composition. Instead, the affinity enhancement can be accurately predicted based on the length of the ID segment and is consistent with the entropic force generated by an unstructured peptide attached to the protein surface
Our data show that the unfolded state of the ID-tail rectifies the dynamics and structure of hUGDH to favor inhibitor binding
For example, the 30-residue disordered C-terminus of hUGDH (residues 465–494) is often removed with no apparent impact on kinetic parameters19. Here, we show that this C-terminal segment (called the ‘ID-tail’) plays a novel role in the allosteric mechanism of hUGDH. hUGDH catalyzes the NAD+-dependent oxidation of UDP-α-D-glucose (UDP-Glc) to UDP-α-D-glucuronic acid19 and is regulated by the allosteric feedback inhibitor UDP-α-D-Xylose (UDP-Xyl)
We used the allostery quenching A136M substitution to see if the ID-tail functions independently of the allosteric switch; this substitution has been shown to lock the allosteric switch and the hexamer in the low UDP-Xyl affinity, E state22. Inhibition studies show no significant difference in UDP-Xyl affinity between hUGDHFL-A136M and hUGDHΔID-A136M, which suggests that the ID-tail requires a functional allosteric switch and the EΩ state to enhance the affinity for UDP-Xyl
the ID-tail functions as a length-dependent (l) entropic rectifier that biases (k) the distribution toward the high affinity substate
Far-UV CD of apoD1 showed a large negative ellipticity peak at 200 nm, suggesting that the protein is intrinsically unstructured (44), which disappeared on calcium addition and emerged as a positive peak (Fig. 7a).
Calcium binding to D1 increased β-sheet content by 2-fold to 42.4%, largely at the expense of the unordered fraction, which reduced to 29.66%.
Calcium binding to D1 increased β-sheet content by 2-fold to 42.4%, largely at the expense of the unordered fraction, which reduced to 29.66%.
Near-UV CD of apoD1 showed a very weak signal, confirming that the protein was in an unstructured state.
Upon the addition of calcium, two strong bands emerged in the spectra of the holoprotein, one at ∼290 nm for the 1Lb band of Trp and a broad peak ∼255–270 nm, with peaks at 262 and 268 nm characteristic of Phe (Fig. 8).

Far-UV CD spectra of domain D2 showed a negative trough at ∼200 nm with a negative peak at 220 nm (Fig. 7b). The secondary structure analysis of the spectra showed that the protein had 31.83% β-sheet, 35.2% unordered, and 23% turns, with 9.6% helix (Table II).
Near-UV CD of the D2 domain showed a broad band between 280 and 290 nm for Trp and Tyr with weak ellipticity (data not shown).
As shown in Fig. 6 (spectrum 1), the far-UV CD spectrum of D2 puriﬁed from inclusion bodies resembles that of a poorly folded protein with low regular secondary structure content.
When D2 puriﬁed from inclusion bodies is excited at 295 nm it shows ﬂuorescence emission maxima at 350 nm, indicating that the engineered Trp is solvent-exposed (Fig. 5, spectrum 1).
Calcium mimic dye Stains-all was used to probe calcium binding to D2 puriﬁed from insoluble fraction. As shown in Fig. 4, the dye–protein complex gives rise to a characteristic peak at 660 nm in the CD spectra. The intensity at 660 nm decreased upon calcium addition, indicating displacement of dye and calcium-binding to the protein. These results suggest that the refolded protein is able to bind calcium and is functionally active.
Direct assay using radioactive 45Ca revealed that both domains, D1 and D2, bind calcium as shown in Fig. 5.
Direct assay using radioactive 45Ca revealed that both domains, D1 and D2, bind calcium as shown in Fig. 5.
The presence of calcium drastically decreased the hydrodynamic volume, and the elution volume corresponds to a monomer (Fig. 10a). Thus, there is significant change in the Stokes radius of the D1 upon calcium binding, which could be attributed to the transition of the protein from an unstructured to a structured state and the resulting compaction (44, 46).

To ascertain whether Vc represents an IDR or not, circular dichroism (CD) spectra of a synthetic peptide precisely corresponding to Vc (38 amino acids) were examined. A large negative peak at approximately 202 nm is characteristic to the coil conformation that dominates in disordered proteins. The minimum spectrum of Vc at around 200 nm typically showed the property of IDR.
The ellipticity at 202 nm was monitored upon increasing the temperature, and was found to increase gradually. However, the lack of an obvious thermal transition indicated that Vc does not take a prominent secondary structure. In addition, the slight CD spectral change was reversible.
Vc (VIPP1 C-terminal tail) acts in promoting flexible mobility against stress by preventing self-association of FVPs; and the elevated expression of VIPP1 improves the tolerance of chloroplasts against heat shock. Dynamic movement of VIPP1 upon stress is a prerequisite for such tolerance,
Architecturally, TAF15 is composed of an intrinsically unstructured N-terminal QGSY rich activation domain which is retained in the oncogenic fusions and possesses trans-activating properties, followed by a central and the C-terminal region comprising the RNA recognition motif (RRM) and a (Cys)4 RanBP2 type Zinc finger (ZnF) with interspersed unstructured elements rich in arginine and glycine, known as RGG motifs. The RRM exhibits highest degree of sequence conservation among the members of the FET family.
15N-{1H} Het-NOE values, corresponding to an average of ~0.75 in the RRM and ZnF domains, and ~0.38 in the RGG linker, indicated the presence of highly dynamic linker between the structured RRM and the RanBP2 type ZnF domain in the multi-domain protein
Moreover, random coil index analysis (RCI) of the backbone32 revealed the absence of any secondary structural elements between E323-K354, which constitute the RGG motif.
conclusively establish the predominant role played by RRM in mediating RNA binding and negate any significant contributions toward RNA recognition by the RGG motifs and the RanBP2 type zinc finger
Very few residues in the RGG motif (E323-R326 and G342), and the RanBP2 type zinc finger domain (S355, F370-R372) exhibited CSPs above the averaged CSP + 1σ (Fig. 2C). The CSPs in E323-R326 region can be explained from its existence as an extension of the C-terminal region of the RRM, which may provide additional contributions in stabilizing the complex. Despite these additional contributions, N- or C-terminal extensions in an RRM have been rarely shown to provide specificity in recognition

The HSQC of the unbound RAM shows that the majority of backbone amide peaks lie within a narrow range of chemical shifts in the proton dimension (7.9-8.5 PPM). There are 3–5 peaks at lower 1H chemical shifts which may indicate some small region(s) of ordered structure. However, the signals broadened significantly in presence of RNMT, showing a wider range of chemical shifts. These data indicate that RAM 2–45 is likely to be flexible in solution, but stabilised by binding to RNMT.

1H-15N heteronuclear NOE experiments show that AF4 residues 761-775 are ordered in the complex whereas the remainder is flexible
The AF4-AF9 fusion included an N-terminal 6-his tag and TEV protease site, with the coding sequence for AF4 residues 738-779 directly fused to AF9 residues 490-568 in pET 32a
Here, we describe a new crystal form of the human Hsp70 ATPase domain. The refined structure of this new crystal form is compared with that previously reported (Sriram et al., 1997) and provides evidence for the flexibility of the IIB subdomain of the structure, which corresponds to residues 229-306 (Flaherty et al., 1990)
Except for the N-terminal 46 amino acids and the C-terminal Jab1/MPN domain, most of the Spp42 sequences have a well-defined EM density

The SRm160 N terminus up to amino acid 299 (Table 1) did not target constructs to splicing speckles. Instead they colocalized with lamin A/C at the nuclear envelope as shown for FLAG-SRm1601–240
Sequences from the N-terminal domain localized proteins to the nuclear lamina near sites where mRNA leaves the nucleus.
Dissecting the N-terminal domain further showed that SRm160300–350 was sufficient to target EGFP to the paraspeckle region adjacent to speckled domains
Amino acids 300–350 targeted SRm160 to sites on the nuclear matrix and peripheral to speckled domains. EGFP-SRm160300–350 was transiently expressed in HeLa cells. EGFP-SRm160300–350 (A) in fixed cells was concentrated in and around speckled domains (overlay, C) as visualized by the B1C8 antibody for SRm160 (B) but was also visible in nucleoli. (D) EGFP-SRm300300–350 remained bound after the removal of soluble proteins and chromatin in a nuclear matrix preparation.
amino acids 300–350, although necessary for targeting the SRm160 N terminus to speckled domains, were inefficient in anchoring the EGFP fusion protein to speckled domains.
Using a series of FLAG- and enhanced GFP-conjugated deletion mutants we found two contiguous sequences that independently target SRm160 to nuclear matrix sites at splicing speckled domains: amino acids 300–350 and 351–688. Constructs containing amino acids 300–350 were also targeted to sites peripheral to speckled domains where most mRNA originate subsequent to splicing. Sequences from the N-terminal domain localized proteins to the nuclear lamina near sites where mRNA leaves the nucleus.
In this study we identified domains of SRm160 important for spatial targeting within the nucleus and for binding to the nuclear matrix.
The spatial targeting and nuclear matrix binding domains of SRm160.
We have identified the sequences within the splicing coactivator SRm160 that target it to the splicing factor-rich, speckled domains of the nucleus. These consist of two contiguous sequence domains of SRm160: amino acids 300–350 and 351–688. Both sequences are characterized by an unusual high content of arginine, proline, and serine: 88% for SRm160300–350 and 64% for SRm160351–688.

We next co-crystallized SNAREΔ60 with a CPX fragment (scCPX) consisting of its central and accessory helices (residues 26–83) and containing three “superclamp” mutations (D27L, E34F, R37A) that increase its clamping efficiency both in vitro19 and in vivo38. The structure was determined at 3.5 Å resolution using the truncated SNARE complex as a search model in the molecular replacement method (Table 1), and CPX was modeled into difference electron density. The final model includes residues 190–250 of syntaxin1, 10–74 and 141–203 of SNAP25, 29–60 of VAMP2, and 26–73 of CPX
However, unlike our previous structure of the Rock SBD, residues 895–913 were disordered
The structure of Lmod1ABS2, the strongest nucleator among the naturally occurring ABS2s analysed here , was determined at 1.54 Å resolution , and shows residues Ala-314 to Gln-486
Residues 613–743 of each crystallographically independent chain have clear and continuous density, whereas the N-terminal 42 residues and the His6 tag are invisible and presumed disordered.
The N-terminal tail consisting of residues Ser77 to Gly104 is highly disordered, as deduced from the secondary chemical shifts, the lack of medium-range and long-range NOEs and the {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOEs
It should also be noted that the N-terminal region of ALY77−182 which corresponds to residues 77−104 is flexible and without regular structure. This N-terminal “tail” contains several aliphatic and aromatic side chains that could also modulate interactions.
Although chemical shift dispersion of the majority of the backbone HN protons is good, overlap was observed for many of the loop regions as well as the N-terminal flexible region.
1H-15N-correlated NMR spectrum of ALY77−182 exhibits signals characteristic of a folded protein plus sharp overlapped resonances indicative of flexible regions
Nevertheless, residues Asp84 to Phe95 exhibit some restriction of motion, as indicated by {1H}-15N heteronuclear NOEs in the range of 0.1−0.2.
ALY itself exhibits RNA binding activity and may act as an RNA chaperone by modulating the formation of RNA−protein and RNA−RNA complexes

Recently, it was reported that ALY is a component of the general mRNA export machinery
In GraT, on the other hand, the first 22 N-terminal residues together with the 6-His tag are located in an interstitial space and could not be traced due to lack of electron density.
The N-terminus of GraT is intrinsically disordered
GraT induction results in a distinct cleavage pattern on lpp mRNA, which is not detected in non-induced samples (Fig. 6, source data are provided as a Source Data file). Most of the observed cut sites are located between the 2nd and 3rd nucleotides of codons with adenine in the 2nd position. The only exception is the 10th cleavage (Fig. 6), which is found between two codons but still following an A nucleotide. Strong codon dependence suggests that, like other HigB family toxins, GraT acts as a ribosome-dependent mRNase. Given that induction of Δ22GraT did not result in mRNA cleavage (Fig. 6), the N-terminal disordered region is necessary for GraT mRNAse activity.
On the other hand, this disordered stretch is more likely to work as an entropic barrier that sterically impedes the formation of the GraT2A2-DNA complex.
EMSAs using different (GraT2A2 or Δ22GraT2A2):operator molar ratios further confirm that in contrast to the wild-type GraT2A2, the Δ22GraT2A2 complex readily binds the graTA operator (Fig. 7c, d). These experiments suggest that the intrinsically disordered N-terminus of GraT is directly responsible for impairment of operator binding, likely via steric hindrance.
β-Galactosidase measurements show that while GraA alone represses the graTA promoter activity, the expression of the GraTA complex leads to full derepression of the promoter (Fig. 8a, source data are provided as a Source Data file). Expression of the Δ22GraTA with N-terminally truncated GraT again represses the promoter (Fig. 8a), which is in good accordance with strong binding of Δ22GraT2A2 to the operator (Fig. 7).

we demonstrate that FRATtide (a peptide corresponding to residues 188–226 of FRAT1) binds to GSK3 and prevents GSK3 from interacting with Axin.
Demonstrated also in PMID:19802005, a short peptide (FRATtide) comprising amino-acids 188–226 from human FRAT1 is sufficient to inhibit GSK3
No electron density was observed for the 25 N-terminal residues (amino acids 3470-3494) and three residues (amino acids 3542-3544) in a loop region. SDS-PAGE analysis of dissolved crystals showed that the crystals contain the full-length fragment, suggesting that these regions are disordered (data not shown).

CD analysis of the ETT_388-594 construct showing characteristic spectrum of an unstructured protein
Circular dichroism and thermal stability analyses confirmed the bioinformatic predictions of near-complete disorder of the ES domain
Analyses by Y2H revealed the ETT_388-594 construct retained full responsiveness to increases in auxin concentration (Fig. 4A; ETT-BD and ES-BD and ETT-388-594-BD rows) confirming it to be a stable and purifiable form of the ETT auxin-responsive domain capable of binding the Arabidopsis INDEHISCENT (IND) transcription factor used as the bait in the assay.

To probe the auxin sensing ability of the ES domain, random mutations were introduced into the ES domain sequence by error prone mutagenesis. A pool of ES mutants was cloned and tested in Y2H assay in the presence of IAA to isolate viable clones exhibiting IAA insensitivity. Tree ES domain variants were isolated (Fig.  4A, clones ES_EP1-3 BD) harbouring amino acid substitutions at the beginning (Fig.  4A, I393T, I424T, F445I) and the end (Fig.  4A, T562A, Y597H, D601G) of the ES domain. Mutations were also identified in proximity to the Motif 1B (Fig.  4A, Q436L) and in the Ser patch (Fig.  4A, S520T) which impair the auxin sensing property of the ETT-IND dimer. In parallel to the error-prone approach, we also introduced manually point mutations into the Ser patch by site-specific mutagenesis (S523T, S S524T, S526T and S527T; Fig.  4a). Interestingly, these specific mutations within the Ser patch strongly inhibited auxin perception.

Two-dimensional 15N-HSQC spectra of the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated L1
linker have limited dispersion in the 1H dimension, with almost all backbone amide 1H
resonances having chemical shifts of 7.9 to 8.6 ppm, and sharp resonances (Figure 1).
Resonances for L1 linker residues in spectra of L1-NBD1 also display limited dispersion and sharp line shapes (42). The limited dispersion of resonances in the 1H dimension is a
characteristic feature in the NMR spectra of disordered proteins and IDRs, in which each amide 1H nucleus experiences on average the same chemical environment.
Additionally, the L1 linker elutes from a size exclusion column at the volume expected for elution of globular proteins of ~14 kDa, rather than proteins of ~6 kDa that are the size of the L1 linker (Supplementary Figure 4). The earlier elution of the L1 linker is also consistent with its disordered nature and larger hydrodynamic radii of the ensemble of the L1 linker conformers compared to globular proteins of the same molecular weight
The CD spectra of the non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated L1 linker are typical of
what is observed for primarily disordered proteins
Phosphorylation of the L1 linker, by protein kinase A, disrupts its interactions with
NBD1, which increases the MgATP affinity of NBD1 and KATP channel gating.

Spectroscopic and biochemical studies indicate that the L1 linker possesses residual secondary and compact structure that is disrupted with phosphorylation, which leads to differential interactions of the nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated L1 linker with NBD1.
Purified hRID is disordered and in the monomeric state.
Interestingly, the apparent molecular weight (MW) of hRID in the gel was two-fold higher than the calculated MW (8.3 kDa). This phenomenon might result from the intrinsic disorder of the hRID structure
Upon polyP addition, the circular dichroism (CD) score at 225 nm was decreased, and the CD score at 190 nm was increased, indicating that helical content increased.
The disorder-to-order transition is induced by tRNA binding and has implications on folding and subsequent assembly into multi-tRNA synthetase complexes.
We found that the structures of WT, K23A, and K27A changed upon polyP addition.

Recently, the N-terminal RNA-interaction domains (RIDs) of LysRS from eukaryotic origins have been used as novel fusion partners to facilitate folding of their genetically fused cargo proteins [11,12,13,14]. The chaperoning function for all three RIDs—human, rabbit, or mouse (hRID, rRID, or mRID, respectively)—was found to enhance the folding and assembly of down-stream target proteins, while fusion of the mutant hRIDs increased soluble aggregates.
The anticipated intrinsic disorder of these constructs (Amata et al. 2014) was evident in the low chemical shift dispersion in the 1H dimension (Fig.  1)
the intrinsically disordered nature of the SH4 and Unique domains has resulted in a lack of information for this important region of the protein that is responsible for membrane association
These enzymes are often found anchored to the intracellular side of the membrane via lipidation of the SH4 domain and are integral components of signaling cascades localized at the cell surface.
Both isoforms may be myristoylated at the N-terminus but p59Hck can also be palmitoylated on Cys3. The variable acylation is thought to be a major determinant in localizations within the cell: p59Hck is mainly associated with the plasma membrane and p61Hck with lysosomal membranes.
The two dominant isoforms of human Hck are referred to as p59Hck and p61Hck. The longer p61 isoform contains an additional 21 residues at the N-terminal end (MGGRSSCEDPGCPRDEERAPR), and is derived from an alternate start codon of the same mRNA. Both isoforms may be myristoylated at the N-terminus but p59Hck can also be palmitoylated on Cys3. The variable acylation is thought to be a major determinant in localizations within the cell: p59Hck is mainly associated with the plasma membrane and p61Hck with lysosomal membranes.
As in our previous work [39], we study an unmyristoylated construct of the Hck SH4-U domains containing residues 2–79, hereafter referred to as SH 4   UHck− (previously referred to as p61HckSH 4   U−). Experimental characterization of the average spatial distribution of SH 4   UHck− at the membrane surface is carried out using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and neutron reflectometry (NR) experiments. Restrained-ensemble molecular dynamics (re-MD) simulations are then utilized to generate statistical models of membrane-bound Hck. The results confirm an interaction between the SH4 domain and acidic lipids, and yield an atomically detailed model of membrane bound SH 4   UHck−.

Although the crystallized construct contains 25 additional C-terminal residues, these are disordered in the structure and do not contribute to Mago–Y14 binding
We next sought to determine where and how the WIRS motif binds to the WRC. For this, we determined the 2.43-Å crystal structure of a complex cocrystallized from a variant of the WIRS-containing peptide (WGAERSM∗STFGKEKA, M∗ for selenomethionine, Figure 1B) and a minimal inhibited WRC, which lacks the C terminus of Abi and the proline-rich region of WAVE, miniWRC (Figure 2 and Table S1) (Chen et al., 2010).
The lack of density corresponding to the N- and C-terminal residues of the peptides is consistent with deletion studies showing no significant effect on binding unless residues within the FPPPP core are deleted
In the Aurora B:INCENP complex, the activation segment is disordered after the DFG motif, including the phosphorylation site Thr232. The C-terminal part of the activation segment is dislodged from the lower lobe and interacts with a deep groove generated by the displaced activation segment in the interacting protomer. Overall, there is a buried surface area of interaction of 3460 Å2, and the segment is anchored mainly by aromatic and hydrophobic interactions of Y239, L237, Pro242, and I245

We report here evidence that human Aurora-B is phosphorylated at Thr-232 through interaction with the INCENP in vivo. This phosphorylation of Thr-232 occurs by means of an autophosphorylation mechanism and is essential for the Aurora-B kinase activity.

Therefore, a bacterial expression construct for the C-terminal part of human INCENP was prepared, spanning residues 835–903, which is the Aurora-binding region.
To provide a model for structure-based design and to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of human Aurora B activation, we determined the structure of human Aurora B kinase domain, in complex with the C-terminal IN-box section of human INCENP (residues 835–903) and the type II inhibitor 1 (Figure ​(Figure11).

We next evaluated whether or not the TSS motif (T893, S894, S895) within the IN box domain of INCENP is involved in Aurora-C activation
In vitro kinase assays on pulled down protein complexes from Sf-9 cells co-infected with WT or 3A mutant of INCENP together with the Aurora-B and -C kinases also confirmed the role of the TSS motif phosphorylation of INCENP in the activation of the two kinases

Since full-length RBM7 precipitated during purification, we used a truncated fragment of RBM7 (residues 1–137 or RBM71–137) lacking part of the unstructured C-terminal region of the protein

The presence of three disordered loops (residues 290–324, 366–380 and 435–444) in Middle domain implicates its role in protein–protein interaction with SE partners and/or substrates.

Two of the five regions of Mif2p were found to be essential for function: those between residues 267 and 347, a segment that contains the CENP-C signature box (green; Figure 1), and those between 331 and 438. These regions contain the likely nuclear localization sequence (QRRKKQKK; Nair and Rost, 2005 blue right-pointing triangle), but we did not explicitly test whether the sequence is essential for correct localization.

The minimum region of MICAL3 required for the binding of MKLP1 corresponds to the deletion mutant MICAL3-CC4 (Fig. 2A, 2B) that spans amino acids 1735-1918
Taken together, our results show that MKLP1 and MICAL3 primarily interact through the unstructured polypeptide region in MKLP1 and the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of MICAL3, with additional contacts provided by the second coiled-coil domain of MICAL3 and the coiled-coil domain of MKLP1

MICAL3 Interacts with MKLP1
We showed that MKLP1 recruits MICAL3 to the central spindle, whereas MICAL3 participates in targeting to the midbody its binding partners ELKS and Rab8A, and the loss of both ELKS and Rab8A also caused cytokinesis defects.
We conclude that MICAL3 can form a triple complex with MKLP1 and ELKS and through the interaction with the former, target the latter to the midbody.
In a mechanism independent of its enzymatic activity, MICAL3 targets the adaptor protein ELKS and Rab8A-positive vesicles to the midbody, and the depletion of ELKS and Rab8A also leads to cytokinesis defects.
We propose that MICAL3 acts as a midbody-associated scaffold for vesicle targeting, which promotes maturation of the intercellular bridge and abscission.
MICAL3 is required for ELKS localization to the midbody.

No interpretable electron density for MCM1 cis residues 2–14 and trans residues 2–17 was observed, and we presume that these residues are disordered in the crystal. These N-terminal residues are not necessary for cell-type-specific transcription or viability, but appear to be involved in a phosphorylation-dependent manner in the yeast cell's response to stress, for example high salt concentrations

In the Hs complex, the equivalent N-terminal eIF4G residues (Q592–L606) were not visible in the electron density map, suggesting either high flexibility or susceptibility to proteolytic degradation during crystallization.
The 1H,15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-Nt4G displays poorly dispersed signals, particularly in the 1H dimension, which suggests that the eIF4G fragment is not structured in solution (Figure 2D).
Upon addition of RRM2, the Nt4G signals became widely dispersed, indicating that the polypeptide folds upon binding to RRM2 (Figure 2E). Backbone assignments of 13C,15N-labeled Nt4G alone and in complex with RRM2 showed that eIF4G residues from Lys178 to Thr202 were affected by RRM2 binding (Figure 2F). No chemical shift changes were observed for the N- and C-terminal residues, suggesting that they do not participate in binding RRM1-2. The large magnitude of the changes (up to 1.56 ppm) reflects the dramatic change from a flexible polypeptide to a rigid, structured conformation in the complex (Figures 2D–2F).
In contrast, NMR titrations of 15N-RRM2 (PABP residues 86–192) with the eIF4G fragment led to specific chemical shift changes of the 1H,15N HSQC signals.
Backbone assignments of 13C,15N-labeled Nt4G alone and in complex with RRM2 showed that eIF4G residues from Lys178 to Thr202 were affected by RRM2 binding (Figure 2F). 
The spectra identify residues 178–203 as the region of eIF4G that binds RRM2.
In both structures, we observed electron density for PABP residues 10–183, nine adenosine nucleotides, and residues 179-198 of eIF4G. The eIF4G peptide adopts a secondary structure of two short b strands and one a helix bound to PABP RRM2 (Figure 3A).
In the presence of Nt4G, the RRM1-2·poly(A) interaction was enhanced, and a supershifted ternary complex was observed. The enhancement of RNA binding was also observed with RRM1-2-3-4 binding to 32P-labeled poly(A)25. Quantification of the amount of poly(A) bound to RRM1-2-3-4 shows that the presence of Nt4G increases the affinity of the RRMs for poly(A) by at least 10-fold (Figure 4B).

To quantify the cooperativity, we measured the binding affinities using ITC. In agreement with the gel shift studies, we found that poly(A)11 binds to the RRM1-2·Nt4G complex with 10-fold better affinity than to RRM1-2, 62 nM and 0.6 μM, respectively (Figure 4C).
To quantify the cooperativity, we used ITC to measure the affinities of eIF4G for RRM2, RRM1-2, and RRM2-3. Comparison of the affinities of RRM1-2 and RRM2 showed that RRM1 decreased the affinity in the absence of poly(A) RNA. Under identical conditions, PABP RRM2 bound Nt4G with 3-fold better affinity than RRM1-2, Kd of 5 μM and 19 μM, respectively (Figure 5C).
We carried out coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) assays on HeLa cell extracts to test the role of RNA on the PABP·eIF4G interaction in cells (Figure 6). Endogenous eIF4G could be immunoprecipitated with an anti-PABP antibody (Figure 6B).
The C-terminal region of human eIF4GI consists of two a-helical domains, 4G/C1 and 4G/C2, joined by a 13 residue linker (Figures 1B and 2).
The linker connecting domains 4G/C1 and 4G/C2 is both highly polar and apparently flexible (10/13 residues were not visible in our electron density maps).
Ten residues in the interdomain linker of 4G/C (left) were not observed in the electron density maps and are shown as a polyalanine trace (violet).
At the final stages of refinement, NCS operators were re-evaluated, and restrained NCS refinement yielded a final model (residues
1234–1566, excluding 1428–1437 from the interdomain linker, rmsd = 0.2 A˚ for 323 a-carbon pairs) with an R factor of 24.4% and an R free of 29.2% (Table 1).
The authors used isoform 8 (DP03499) in their experiments, which is 1 residue longer than isoform A. Thus, region 1428-1437 corresponds to region 1427-1436 of the canonical UniProt sequence. The sequence of the disordered region is identical in both isoforms.

Sequence comparisons (Figure 1A), secondary structure predictions (data not shown), and limited proteolysis combined with mass spectrometry (data not shown) permitted identification of a protease-resistant C-terminal portion of human eIF4GI that supports binding to eIF4A and Mnk1 (data not shown). Further truncation (eIF4GI[1235–1572]) yielded a two-domain protein that gives high-quality crystals with two protomers per asymmetric unit (Experimental Procedures).
Limited proteolysis of the C-terminal region of human eIF4GI (residues 1080–1600) with a panel of specific endoproteases yielded a resistant core of approximately 40 kDa, as judged by gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing of proteolytic fragments mapped a large number of proteolytic cleavage sites to residues 1080–1234.
The authors used isoform 8 (DP03499) in their experiments, which is 1 residue longer than isoform A. Thus, region 1080-1234 corresponds to region 1079-1233 of the canonical UniProt sequence. The sequence of the disordered region is identical in both isoforms.
The N-terminal Regions of Hs and Dm eIF4E Are Not Required for Binding to eIF4G
Although full-length eIF4E was used in the human complex, the first 29 residues (M1–A29) are not visible in the electron density map
In this NMR ensemble of the apo-eIF4E, the loops S1–S2, H2–S3, H4–S5 and S7–S8 are less defined while the first 35 residues at the N-terminus are completely disordered.
The authors mention in the Results and discussion section that the N-terminal methionine is removed from the protein: As can be seen in Figure 2A, the molecular mass of eIF4E is 24964.373.2 Da slightly less than the predicted mass 25097.2 Da. This mass difference (132.9 Da) corresponds to the loss of methionine (131.2 Da) at the N-terminus, which is a common event (Huang et al, 1987). The absence of Met1 in the NMR data corroborates this hypothesis.
The present results provide the structural basis for the biological function of both N- and C-terminal mobile regions of eIF4E in translation initiation, especially the regulatory function through the switch-on/off of eIF4E-binding protein–eIF4E phosphorylation.
However, the structures of the N- and C-terminal regions are still unclear, because of the high flexibility of these regions in eIF4E.
As is shown in Figure 1, we could determine the structure from Glu27 (in both complexes of human full-length eIF4E; it was impossible to determine the structure from the N-terminus to Gln26 because of the high flexibility.
In contrast with large flexibility at both N- and C-terminal regions, the core regions consisting of eight-stranded anti-parallel b-sheets and three long a-helices are very similar to each other.
N-terminal unstructured regions of metazoan eIF4Es
Together these data suggest that additional amino acids beyond residue 136 in the longer construct are disordered and the tepsin ENTH domain is indeed smaller than other published ENTH structures by two α-helices.

Anp32e residues 186-213 and 225-232 were not observable in the structure because of lack of electron density
We determined the crystal structure of the Anp32e chaperone domain (186-232) in complex with the H2A.Z-H2B dimer. In this structure, the region containing Anp32e residues 214-224, which is absent in other Anp32 family proteins, specifically interacts with the extended H2A.Z αC helix, which exhibits an unexpected conformational change.

The crystal structure, in conjunction with our biochemical data, indicates that the N-terminal region of tGeminin might be required to anchor tCdt1
In the second part of the tGeminin–tCdt1 interface, a surface groove on Cdt1 formed by helix H6 and loop L2 of tCdt1 binds the ten residues in the N-terminal loop of tGemimin monomer (Fig. 2b).
The ten residues immediately N-terminal to the coiled-coil domain form a loop and a short helix. These residues and the N-terminal part of the coiled coil of tGeminin bind to tCdt1.
Structural basis for inhibition of the replication licensing factor Cdt1 by geminin" Article "The deletion of these ten residues decreased tGeminin's binding affinity to tCdt1 about 15-fold (Supplementary Table 2).
Dissociation constants of Cdt1 to geminin - determined by ITC (Supplementary Table 2) - correspond to 4.4 ± 2.2 nM in the case of tGeminin (geminin79-157) and to 56.2 ± 10.1 nM in the case of geminin89-157 where the first ten residues are deleted, thus indicating a decrease in the binding affinity.
Residues 28–60 of N-Myc are not observed in the structure, whereas residues 61–89 are associated with the cleft between the N- and C-lobes of the Aurora-A kinase domain formed by the αB/αC helices, the activation loop, and the αG helix

TRF1TRFH exhibits essentially the same conformation as unliganded TRF1TRFH except for loop L34. Loop L34 is partially disordered in the peptide-free structure. However, once TIN2TBM is bound, loop L34 folds back upon helices α3 and α4, sandwiched between the helices and TIN2TBM
In contrast, the C terminus of TIN2TBM (L263-G-R-R-R-V268) is positioned on the surface of loop L34 through formation of an antiparallel β sheet with D139-A-Q141 of TRF1TRFH so that R265-R-R267 of TIN2TBM contacts TRF1TRFH through electrostatic interactions. In particular, R266 is nested within an acidic depression on the surface of loop L34 through a network of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds
TRF1 and TRF2 both bind to another shelterin protein: TIN2 (12, 15, 16). The TRF1-TIN2 interaction was mediated by TRF1TRFH and the C terminus of TIN2 (12). Further mapping revealed that a peptide of TIN2—denoted as TIN2256–276 [TIN2TBM: TIN2–TRFH binding motif (TBM)]—retains the TRF1TRFH binding activity with a binding affinity of 314 nM

We dissect the interactions of TRF1 and TRF2 with their shared binding partner (TIN2) and other shelterin accessory factors. TRF1 recognizes TIN2 using a conserved molecular surface in its TRF homology (TRFH) domain. However, this same surface does not act as a TIN2 binding site in TRF2, and TIN2 binding to TRF2 is mediated by a region outside the TRFH domain. Instead, the TRFH docking site of TRF2 binds a shelterin accessory factor (Apollo), which does not interact with the TRFH domain of TRF1. Conversely, the TRFH domain of TRF1, but not of TRF2, interacts with another shelterin-associated factor: PinX1.
ne of the major conformational changes in VEGF-B10–108 structure is observed in the loop comprising residues 37–46 of VEGF-B10–108
The Cα atoms of Leu39, Met40, and Gly41 are displaced by 5.7 Å, 5.2 Å, and 5.8 Å, respectively. This loop is involved in crystal packing with the constant domain of the Fab molecule. Extensive symmetry-related interactions have stabilised the loop, which was disordered in the native structure of VEGF-B10–108
Despite preservation of the overall structure in the complex, conformational differences in three loop regions 37–46, 61–67, and 84–89 of the VEGF-B10–108 dimer were observed.

The refined αTAT1/AcCoA structure reveals continuous electron density from amino acid 3 to 195, except for two short unresolved loops (residues 26–36 and 84–91)
An expression construct encoding residues 2–236 of human αTAT1 was shown to retain almost 100% of microtubule acetyltransferase activity relative to the full-length protein, and secondary structure prediction algorithms suggested that the C terminus of the protein, residues ∼230–333, were disordered
Although the expression construct used for crystallization contained ∼40 residues C-terminal to the last resolved residue, and confirmed by mass spectrometry to be present in the crystals, this portion of the protein was not observed in the electron density map
Based on this result, we conclude that residues 196–236 are disordered in the crystals.
We found it interesting that residues 196–236 of αTAT1 were disordered in the crystal structure because K233 was reported to be acetylated, suggesting that K233 acetylation does not play a regulatory role for catalysis

We found it interesting that residues 196–236 of αTAT1 were disordered in the crystal structure because K233 was reported to be acetylated, suggesting that K233 acetylation does not play a regulatory role for catalysis, similar to autoacetylation sites in the Rtt109 and MYST histone acetyltransferases (HATs) that are highly ordered in the corresponding crystal structures (15, 21).

Crystals of GRASP65 were obtained ~1 month after the crystallization setup. A 2.2-Å dataset was collected, and the structure was determined by molecular replacement (Table 1), but only residues 12–210 were visible in the electron density.
the isolated AIS sequence is highly flexible and solvent-accessible
Here, we report the crystal structure of the mouse SAD-B C-terminal fragment including the AIS and the kinase-associated domain 1 (KA1) at 2.8 Å resolution. The KA1 domain is structurally conserved, while the isolated AIS sequence is highly flexible and solvent-accessible.

The absence of electron density suggests that switches I and II are disordered.
Overall, our structure reveals that switch I and switch II of Rem2 are flexible regions in the GDP-bound form and in the absence of the N- and C-terminal extensions.
Our analysis supports the idea that the crystal-packing environment stabilizes or imposes a conformation on the switch regions and that the switch regions are disordered in the absence of contact.
Differences in the crystal-packing environment revealed that the switch I and switch II regions are flexible and not ordered as previously reported
No defined electron density was observed in the switch I and II regions, i.e. residues 137–150 and 171–182 of molecule A, and residues 138–149 and 171–182 of molecule B.

Residues 138–152 and 177–183 are not defined in the electron density and were not included in the model.
Beyond Ser270, the electron density for IFNLR1 is poor, suggesting disorder of the peptide backbone likely due to a lack of contacts with JAK1. In addition, we were unable to model the IFNLR1 box2 motif due to significant structural disorder in the JAK1 SH2 domain.

The C-terminal portion of DUE-B (amino acids 152–209) is not visible in the crystal structure and is predicted to be dynamically disordered
We further demonstrate that the C-terminal portion of the enzyme is disordered and not essential for dimerization. However, this region is essential for DNA binding in vitro and becomes ordered in the presence of DNA.

Electron densities of two Axin1 segments, Axin1(18-30) and Axin1(60-79), can be clearly visualized on the two ARC2 surfaces in the swapped TNKS dimers (Fig. S4). While the remaining parts of Axin1 cannot be seen in the electron density maps, these two Axin1 segments are likely from the same Axin1(1-80) molecule, since SEC results indicate that Axin1(1-80) stabilizes TNKS(308-655) dimerization in solution (Fig. S3), most likely by interacting with both copies of the swapped dimer. In addition, the distance between Axin1 G30 and A60 Cα atoms in our structure is 49.4 Å, which can be covered by the 29 missing residues in between

The SD4 of IFNAR1 has been shown to be unnecessary for IFN binding (Lamken et al., 2005) and, consistent with electron-microscopic studies (Li et al., 2008), it was not visible in the electron density maps.
Outside of the two WWE modules and the 12 C-terminal residues described above, electron density corresponding to the fairly long N- and C-terminal flanking sequences (17 and 60 residues, respectively; see the dashed regions in Figure 1B) is not interpretable, indicating that these two regions are disordered. This apparent disorder suggests that these terminal sequences might not be necessary for the structural integrity of the tandem WWE domain, despite moderate sequence conservation among Deltex orthologs

This apparent disorder suggests that these terminal sequences might not be necessary for the structural integrity of the tandem WWE domain, despite moderate sequence conservation among Deltex orthologs
Residues 185-202 at the N terminus and residue 459 at the C terminus were not seen in electron density and are presumed disordered in this structure.
The final model includes two RIIIDs, dsRBD, and 53% of CED from DROSHA and two G1 helices from DGCR8. The model does not include N-terminal 21 residues, residues 459–521, 668–674, and 712–849 within CED, residues 930–957 in RIIIDa, and C-terminal 32 residues, because their electron densities are unclear or missing.

It is possible that the flexible regions such as PAZ-like domain or MB helix may be located closely to the UG or GHG elements.
The current structure covers most of the conserved regions of DROSHA except for the putative PAZ-like domain (residues 714–849, see below) (Figure 1A), whose electron density was insufficient to build a reliable model probably due to structural flexibility.

Residues 147–159 of Air2p, a portion of the peptide linker between the fourth and fifth zinc knuckles, are disordered and were not modeled.
The linker acts as a spacer, allowing us to delete individual zinc knuckles while not shortening the distance between the remaining ones.
The fourth zinc knuckle (residues 123–136) is tethered to Trf4p via the adjacent linker region but has little direct contact with the surface of Trf4p.

Three regions are disordered in the structure, residues 243 to 247 in chain A and 244 to 248 in chain B at the loop between β3 and αC, residues 367 to 382 within the activation loop, and residues 449 to 460 in A and 449 to 463 in B at the long insertion between αG and αH (Fig. 3B). Despite being largely disordered, the IRAK1 activation loop is natively phosphorylated at S373, S375, S376, and T381, as shown by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) (Fig. S2). It should be noted that the disordered activation loop (residues 367 to 382) situates away from the inhibitor-binding site

The typical transmembrane region is invisible in the EM map at the first sight. A close examination reveals that the densities of wheel outer ring are discontinuous, indicating that this region represents the TM region, which is invisible due to its flexibility or the C11 symmetry
The atomic model with 159 amino acids (149 amino acids were assigned side chain) was built for this region of each protomer according to the lumenal domain sequence of human SEIPIN. The final model is an undecamer with the lumenal domain alone, whose diameter is 160 Å

We also included models of the flexible Bye1 SPOC and PHD domains, with the latter positioned on the H3 tail emerging from the core nucleosome particle (Fig. 5C). Although the trajectory of the H3 tail is unclear and although the linkers between the Bye1 domains are flexible, the resulting model explained the position of the ChIP peak with high H3K4me3 occupancy.
In Bye1, the central TFIIS-like domain (TLD, residues 232–365) is flanked by an N-terminal plant homeo domain (PHD) (residues 74–134) and a C-terminal Spen paralogue and orthologue C-terminal (SPOC) domain (residues 447–547)

Bye1 PHD domain contributes to chromatin association by binding trimethylated H3K4 peptides
The Bye1 PHD domain and full-length Bye1 bound specifically to H3K4me3 peptides (Fig. 4A). The high correlation between arrays probed with full-length Bye1 and the isolated PHD domain indicated that the histone-binding potential of Bye1 is harbored within its PHD domain
Additional functional data in vitro and in vivo indicate that Bye1 occupies active genes in their 5′-region and can bind to histone H3 tails with PTMs of active transcription using its PHD domain.

The CTD linker (residues 883–933) is not observed in the structure
The CTD Linker Is Required for Gαq Activation
Because the sequence of the CTD linker is not conserved among PLCβ isozymes, its length and/or flexibility seems to be required for the proximal and distal CTDs to make all the interactions necessary for activation by Gαq.
Furthermore, deletion of the CTD linker leads to complete loss of Gαq activation in our assays
PLCβ also has a ~400 amino acid C-terminal extension to the catalytic core that contains the proximal and distal C-terminal domains (CTDs) separated by a non-conserved, low complexity linker of variable length

In the distal CTD, the Dα3-Dα4 (residues 1009–1025) and Dα4-Dα5 (residues 1108–1114) loops and C-terminal residues 1193–1234 lacked electron density, consistent with being disordered (Supplementary Fig. 3a).
To elucidate a structural basis for the functional roles of the distal CTD, we used X-ray crystallography and single particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo EM) to determine the structure of human full-length PLCβ3 in complex with activated Gαq, revealing the distal CTD in the context of a fully functional signaling complex where it forms unanticipated interactions with Gαq and the catalytic core of PLCβ that likely contribute to regulation.
The distal CTD (residues 934–1192) consists of three primarily anti-parallel helical segments that extend nearly the full-length (~140 Å) of the domain (Fig. 1b, ​,2a).2a). The first segment contains the Dα1 (residues 935–946), Dα2 (954–958) and Dα3 (960–1008) helices. Dα3 forms an extended anti-parallel coiled-coil interaction with the Dα4 helix (residues 1027–1107) in the second segment. Dα4 in turn forms an extended anti-parallel coiled-coil interaction with Dα5 (residues 1115–1183) in the third segment. The Dα1 and Dα2 helices at the beginning of the first segment, and Dα6 (residues 1184–1192) at the end of the third segment, form “arms” that cross the same face of the domain and pack against the principal helices of the other two segments

Here we report the crystal structures of human CPSF-73 at 2.1 Å resolution, complexed with zinc ions and a sulfate that may mimic the phosphate group of the substrate, and the related yeast protein CPSF-100 (Ydh1p) at 2.5 Å resolution. Both CPSF-73 and CPSF-100 contain two domains, a metallo-β-lactamase domain and a novel β-CASP domain. 
There are, however, significant differences in the structures of CPSF-100 and CPSF-73 (Supplemental Fig. 4). Most importantly, motifs for zinc binding in the metallo-β-lactamase domain are missing in CPSF-100 (Supplemental Fig. 2b), and therefore this protein cannot bind zinc and is unlikely to possess nuclease activity. In addition, the β-CASP domain of CPSF-100 (Fig. 2b) is much larger than that of CPSF-73, but contains a highly flexible segment (Supplemental Results and Supplemental Fig. 5).
Several segments of CPSF-73 are disordered in these crystals (1-6, 113-121, 289-299 in the
presence, and 1-8, 113-121, 184-188, 272-304 in the absence of zinc), as is the case in the
structure of yeast CPSF-100 (269-275, 389-396, 423-625).
residues 1–142 showed little potential for forming secondary structure.
We could not find additional density consistent with residues beyond 551 (connecting the Sac3 M-subcomplex and the Sac3 CID-subcomplex) and so it is likely that this linker is flexible, consistent with the random orientation observed for the CID region relative to the M-region in negatively stained electron micrographs.
No other difference density was observed that could correspond to the CID domain of the complex (containing Sac3 residues 727–805, together with two Sus1 chains and a Cdc31 chain), consistent with the crystals containing only the N-terminal half of Sac3 (up to about residue 555) together with Thp1 and Sem1.

There was however, no clear additional density that could be identified with the linkers between these helices or with the CID region of the complex, consistent with the CID region not having a defined orientation relative to the M-region as observed in the negatively-stained material. It is likely that within the cryo-EM micrographs recorded that the CID-subcomplex is also present in random orientations, however since the CID-subcomplex is effectively little more than a single α-helix with small proteins attached, the signal-to-noise is too poor for the particles to be detected with confidence

The  crystal  structure  was  determined  by molecular replacement to a resolution of 2.92 Å.

The electron density map clearly shows side chain features, and it allowed us to identify the segment as a fragment of P7 protein (Figure 1D). P7 protein is thought to be a nonspecific nucleic acid binding protein (Ueda et al., 1997
). This fragment of P7 protein binds tightly to part of P3 protein with a β sheet structure (Figure 1D). This tight interaction between the core and the nucleic acid binding protein P7 might be important for the transport of nucleic acids into viral particles during the process of viral assembly.

Electron density corresponding to both domain A and the β-ribbon domain of RVFV Gn was not visible and could not be sterically accommodated in the RVFV Gn-Fab RV-Gn1 crystal, indicating that these regions were likely cleaved during crystallogenesis
Previous structural analyses of RVFV Gn have revealed a triangular organization composed of three domains: domain A (residues 154–300), domain B (residues 366–439), and a β-ribbon domain (residues 301–365 and 440–469)

The structural organization of Dr GlnRS was established by separate multiple sequence alignments. A first alignment of known bacterial GlnRSs shows that Dr GlnRS is highly similar to other bacterial GlnRSs, with the exception of a few insertions (17, 27 and 5 additional residues in the structured region 410–433 and in two loops 535–565 and 610–620, respectively) and the presence of a short N-terminal extension (M1–A43) and a long C-terminal appendix (G633–A862)

Remarkably, the Yqey domain has a disordered orientation in the structure of GlnRS where it acts as a tRNAGln affinity enhancer.
Taken together, the Yqey flexible module increases the catalytic efficiency of GlnRS for both tRNAGln-dependent Gln activation and tRNAGln charging and is involved in binding of tRNAGln to GlnRS.

Several proteolysis sites could result in this 6 kDa fragment. For example, 3C protease was used to remove the N-terminal affinity tag, and aberrant cleavage could have occurred at residue Gln237. Alternatively, cleavage could have occurred at Arg238 by the trypsin-like protease II of E. coli (Strongin et al., 1979 ▸) if this protease were retained in tiny amounts after purification.
N-terminal to the first ordered residue of the dimerization domain is a short linker at residue Arg238 followed by the last α-helix of the GTPase domain, via analogy to other family members. As described above, Gln237 and Arg238 are possible proteolytic sites for the fragment crystallized here.

The L-shaped molecule can be divided into a flexible repeat I (LNS1-EGF-A-LNS2), a rigid horseshoe-shaped repeat II (LNS3-EGF-B-LNS4) with structural similarity to so-called reelin repeats, and an extended repeat III (LNS5-EGF-B-LNS6) with controlled flexibility.
Neurexin repeat I is flexible
No electron density is observed for L1 and EGF-A, though present in the crystal, suggesting that these N-terminal modules are disordered and can adopt multiple conformations. Thus, the crystal structure of n1α reveals 7 out of 9 modules (1003 residues per molecule) organized in an L-shaped assembly.
N1α appears increasingly flexible towards its N-terminus
The L1-EGF-A-L2 repeat appears flexible, as L1 and EGF-A are not visible in the crystal structure.

RsaA amino acid residues 249-1026 were resolved in the resulting electron density map
At least amino acid residues 256-1026 were still present in the crystallised protein as determined by mass spectrometry after protease cleavage into peptides, a method that does not reveal the exact N- and C-termini of the analysed polypeptide
In a previous study, we determined the crystal structure of a self-inactivated form of RipA in which the catalytic site cleft of the enzyme is physically locked by a pro-domain, and proposed that the activation of the RipA zymogen occurs through proteolytic cleavage (Ruggiero, Marasco et al., 2010). Recent work has confirmed that RipA is proteolytically activated in vivo and that overproduction of activated RipA produces severe growth defects in Mtb (Chao et al., 2013).

A dataset to 3.1 Å resolution collected on this crystal at DLS beamline I04 generated a definite MR solution with Phaser (RFZ=6.8 TFZ=14.4 PAK=0 LLG=173 TFZ==14.7 RFZ=7.0 TFZ=7.6 PAK=9 LLG=627 TFZ==10.4 LLG=807 TFZ==10.0; space group P21212), using the BT1762 structure and a Sculptor-generated model of BT2264 (21% sequence identity) as search models. In this crystal, there is only one SusC protomer within the asymmetric unit, with the SusC homodimer generated by crystallographic symmetry.
The 282 residues N-terminal to the PRCV RBD in the S3H protein were largely disordered or degraded during crystallization, and are absent in the structure.
The ordered region of IIIa (aa 1–300) is composed of mostly α-helices and organized as two domains: NT domain (NTD; aa 1–134) and middle domain (MDLD; aa 135–300) (Fig. 3c). The CT domain (CTD; aa 400–585), which also contains a few (predicted) helices, is disordered.
From Table 2, 1–303 corresponds to the ordered region of IIIa and 304–585 corresponds to the disordered region of IIIa. Also the PDB show this boundaries as disordered (304-585).

Only the first two domains could be resolved in the electron density map (Figures 2C and 2D). The crystal lattice did not contain space to accommodate the third domain, suggesting it had been proteolytically cleaved prior to crystal growth.

To improve crystallizability, we generated ΔBCCP variants of full-length ACC, which, based on SAXS analysis, preserve properties of intact ACC (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 2a–c). For CthΔBCCP, crystals diffracting to 8.4 Å resolution were obtained. However, molecular replacement did not reveal a unique positioning of the BC domain. Owing to the limited resolution the discussion of structures of CthCD-CT and CthΔBCCP is restricted to the analysis of domain localization. Still, these structures contribute considerably to the visualization of an intrinsically dynamic fungal ACC.

polydispersity) was evident, indicative of a species homogeneous in size distribution with a rather large apparent hydrodynamic radius (4.1 nm ± 0.7). 
In agreement with the hypothesis that PG(38–136) is an IDP, collected spectrum showed a strong negative molar ellipticity value at 198 nm and a negative band between 210 and 230 nm (Fig.  3a), indicative of a protein in a largely disordered conformation.
In conclusion, collected far-UV-CD data give strong evidence that PG (38–136) is an IDP possessing some residues in PPII conformation.
In the same paper, our finding proved that the PG domain was able to assist the catalysis mediated by the CA domain. 
CA domain was titrated with diferent concentrations of PG (38–136) and the catalytic activity was evaluated. In agreement with the previous results, it was observed that 10 µM PG(38–136) was able to increase the CA catalytic activity of about 63%.
The 1D [1H] NMR spectrum (Fig. S3a) together with the 2D [1H, 1H] TOCSY (Total Correlation Spectroscopy) [32] and 2D [1H, 1H] NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser
Enhancement Spectroscopy) [33] experiments (Fig. S3b) appear typical of IDPs. In particular, the 1D [1H] (Fig. S3a) and 2D [1H, 1H] TOCSY (Fig. S3b left panel) spectra present low chemical shift dispersion with the backbone amide HN protons resonating in the narrow random coil range between 8 and 8.6 ppm.
The incubation of PG(38–136) with trypsin protease at diferent ratios showed a complete cleavage in the early hours of the reaction.
Circular dichroism (CD) spectra reveal that the BH3 peptides investigated are mainly

BH3 peptides calculated from MRE value at 222 nm19, ranges between approximately 9-

Here, we describe crystal structures of the pro-survival proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) in complex with a 34-mer peptide from Bax that encompasses its BH3 domain. These structures reveal canonical interactions between four signature hydrophobic amino acids from the BaxBH3 domain and the BH3-binding groove of the pro-survival proteins.
The boundaries of the helical segment were derived from the PDB file.
We used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to characterize the CytR DBD free in solution and to determine the high-resolution structure of a CytR DBD monomer bound specifically to one DNA half-site of the uridine phosphorylase (udp) operator. We find that the free DBD populates multiple distinct conformations distinguished by up to four sets of NMR peaks per residue.
We began our studies of the DBD free state and first assessed the structure and stability of the protein by collecting 15N HSQC NMR spectra over a range of temperatures. As the temperature is increased, the dispersion of the peaks is reduced, indicating that the protein unfolds until only one set of random coil-like signals is obtained at 35 °C
These stable structures coalesce into a single, more stable udp-bound form that features a three-helix bundle containing a canonical helix-turn-helix motif.
In the presence of the udp half-site DNA, we find a single set of well-dispersed DBD peaks in the NMR spectrum. This peak pattern exists at 20 °C and remains above 35 °C (Figure 1B). The structural consequences of DNA binding are reversible for DNA substrates; removal of DNA results in the return of the original DBD HSQC spectrum that reflects multiple protein conformations.

When associated with DNA, the DBD is a three-helix bundle containing a canonical helix–turn–helix motif.
The structure and stability of the free-state DBD were probed further using CD spectroscopy. The far-UV CD spectrum (Figure 2A) indicates primarily α-helix and random coil. The secondary structure composition was estimated using CDSSTR as implemented in CDPro.(22) The reconstructed spectrum that gave the best fit (Figure 2A) predicts a helical content of 22% at 20 °C, with the remainder predicted to be random coil.
In the case of the free-state DBD, no peaks were detectable in the NMR 15N HSQC spectrum within 10 min of the transfer into D2O, revealing complete amide proton exchange.
In the case of the free-state DBD, no peaks were detectable in the NMR 15N HSQC spectrum within 10 min of the transfer into D2O, revealing complete amide proton exchange. In contrast, with the DBD bound to the udp half-site, we find that 30 peaks are present in the NMR spectrum following resuspension in D2O (Figure 1C). These amide protons of the DBD–DNA complex exchange more slowly than those exposed to solvent, suggesting that they are involved in stable secondary structure or are buried within the protein interior or the protein–DNA interface.
The exchange-protected residues of the DNA-bound form reside in this segment of the protein.
The reconstructed spectrum that gave the best fit (Figure 2A) predicts a helical content of 22% at 20 °C, with the remainder predicted to be random coil. This is equivalent to only 15 residues in a helical conformation, slightly more than half the number of helical residues that we find in the bound form.
We used the fluorescence anisotropy of a dye-conjugated (Alexa 532) DNA substrate to monitor the binding of the CytR DBD to DNA. Results of titration experiments (Figure 3) indicate that the CytR DBD binds the udp operator left half-site. We analyzed titration data assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry between monomeric protein and DNA.

The cytidine repressor (CytR) is a member of the LacR family of bacterial repressors with distinct functional features. The Escherichia coli CytR regulon comprises nine operons whose palindromic operators vary in both sequence and, most significantly, spacing between the recognition half-sites.
The SH4 and UD chemical shifts show the low dispersion typical of disordered regions either alone or when part of the to the USH3 construct.
The presence of fuzzy complexes was assessed by chemical shift perturbation, comparing the environment of backbone NH signals from residues in both the SH3 and disordered domains with those of the respective isolated domains. Significant perturbations far from the connecting residues are indicative of interdomain interactions while the retention of low dispersion in the SH4 and UD confirms that these regions remain disordered in the complex.
the initial 18 residues, including the entire SH4 domain, are clearly not affected by the presence of the SH3 domain. Therefore, in the case of Lyn, the fuzzy complex involves only the SH3 and Unique domains.
the evidence presented here support a general universal mechanism in which the Unique domain of the various SFK acts as a reader of the intracellular environment, by using the exquisite plasticity of the disordered regions, and transmit this information to generate the proper kinase response, through the fuzzy complex with the SH3 domain
We have used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to show the formation of an intramolecular fuzzy complex in LynA and we show that the 21-residue segment (P23 to R43) that is absent in the LynB isoform contains a specific interaction site with the RT-loop of the SH3 domain, thus making the fuzzy complexes formed by the two isoforms, structurally distinct.
we first characterized LIC1-C (residues 388–523) by NMR spectroscopy. The 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of LIC1-C at 25°C showed a narrow 7.8 to 8.6 parts per million (ppm) amide-proton chemical shift range, indicating a predominance of structural disorder (Fig 1C). Near-complete backbone resonance assignment was achieved (104 out of the 117 nonproline residues; Fig 1C, S2 Fig). An overlay of 15N-1H HSQC spectra of two smaller constructs, consisting of residues 388–471 and 472–523, reproduced the spectrum obtained from the entire LIC1-C (S2A Fig). This finding indicates that there are no long-range interactions between N- and C-terminal segments of LIC1-C.
the relaxation data show that LIC1-C is intrinsically disordered with large amplitudes of motions faster than nanoseconds. In helix 1 and 2, the amplitudes are smaller and the local reorientation slower but still on the fast timescale. These results support the highly transient character of the helices derived from the SSP score.
Adaptors known to bind LIC1-C include BICD2 and Spindly (SPDL1), which are likely related [15,16], as well as the structurally distinct adaptors HOOK3, RAB11 family-interacting protein 3 (RAB11FIP3; hereafter referred to as FIP3), and RAB-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP) [12,17].
To identify adaptor binding sites in LIC1-C, we recorded 15N-1H HSQC spectra of LIC1-C bound to SPDL1(2–359), BICD2(2–422), and HOOK3(2–239) using molar ratios of 1:0, 1:0.5, and 1:1 (Fig 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D). The spectra obtained from each titration series revealed similar modes of interaction for the three adaptors. Rather than chemical shifts being perturbed, many peaks were significantly attenuated because of binding.
The spectrum of LIC1-C corresponded largely to structural disorder. However, there were negative values at 208 nm and a negative shoulder at 222 nm. These features are indicative of residual helical structure, in agreement with our findings from NMR spectroscopy.

We also measured binding to fluorescently labeled LIC1(388–523) in microscale thermophoresis (MST) experiments. We obtained KD values of 13.1 ± 0.4 μM and 6.0 ± 1.3 μM for the interaction with SPDL1(2–359) and BICD2(2–422), respectively, which is in reasonable agreement with the SPR analysis

To directly test whether helix 1 is important for adaptor binding, we performed in vitro pull-down experiments using purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged versions of LIC1-C (Fig 3A and 3B) and LIC2-C (Fig 4A and 4B) as bait. In addition to BICD2(2–422), SPDL1(2–359), and HOOK3(2–552), we purified full-length versions of RILP (residues 1–401) and FIP3 (residues 2–756), as well as an N-terminal fragment of NIN (residues 1–693) (Fig 3C, S1B Fig). Using Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblotting for the Strep-tag II at the adaptor C terminus, all adaptors were readily detected in GST pull-downs with LIC1(388–523) and LIC1(388–471) (Fig 3D).
HdeA exists as a well-folded homodimer in the inactive state, and its activation requires acid-induced protein unfolding accompanied by dimer dissociation, resulting in the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces for interaction with denatured client proteins (9-10, 13, 18-23).
HdeA exists as a well-folded homodimer in the inactive state, and its activation requires acid-induced protein unfolding accompanied by dimer dissociation, resulting in the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces for interaction with denatured client proteins (9-10, 13, 18-23).
Taking all the above factors into consideration, it is clear that the two segments that are rich in hydrophobic residues, namely the 28–35 and 49–55 segments, play central roles in directly binding to unfolded client proteins under acid stress.
hdeA gene deletion abolishes E. coli acid resistance in vivo
We show by intramolecular FRET that the partially unfolded character of active HdeA allows the chaperone to adopt different conformations as required for the recognition and high-affinity binding of different substrate proteins.
Our results are consistent with a model in which HdeA stably binds substrates at low pH, thereby preventing their irreversible aggregation. pH neutralization subsequently triggers the slow release of substrate proteins from HdeA, keeping the concentration of aggregation-sensitive intermediates below the threshold where they begin to aggregate. This provides a straightforward and ATP-independent mechanism that allows HdeA to facilitate protein refolding.
The results indicate that, as the pH transitions to 4.0 and lower (and progressively falls below the pKas for aspartate and glutamate residues), the protein samples a larger range of conformations as a precursor to unfolding and transitioning to the monomer. Based on these results it appears that the dimer interface is one of the first segments within the HdeA dimer to start opening up, as shown by the large loss of solvent protection for helix B at pH 4.0.

We noticed that the migration rates of ATI1-N and ATI2-N in SDS-PAGE were slower than
expected by their molecular weights (MwATI1 -N = 20.46 kDa; MwATI2-N = 21.02 kDa) (Fig. 3A). This simple observation represents a first indication that ATI1 -N and ATI2-N may be intrinsically disordered, because IDRs are typically depleted in hydrophobic residues, and, consequently, tend to bind less SDS, explaining their abnormally slow mobility in SDS-PAGE [37].
Since we cannot exclude that ATI1-N and ATI2-N form folded dimers, we subjected ATI1-N,
ATI2-N and the globular GST to heat treatments for 10 min at 75°C or 5 min at 95°C, and separated
aggregated from soluble protein by centrifugation (Fig. 3C-D). These aggregation tests showed that,
in contrast to the GST control, ATI1-N and ATI2-N remained soluble upon subjection to elevated
temperatures that unfold most globular proteins from non-thermophilic organisms.
We next subjected protein samples of ATI1-N, ATI2-N and the similarly sized, globular prolactin (PRL, 23 kDa) to size-exclusion chromatography in which the elution volume decreases with the Stokes radius of the protein, such that folded proteins elute at larger volumes than IDPs of similar molecular mass. ATI2-N eluted at the smallest volume (67 ml), followed by ATI1-N (75 ml), and finally the globular PRL (85 ml) (Figure 3B), suggesting that the Stokes radii (r) increase in the order r(PRL) < r(ATI1-N) < r(ATI2-N).
The CD spectra of both ATI1-N and ATI2-N showed characteristic negative minima ∼200 nm, indicating a low content of secondary structure (Figure 4A). In addition, the broad minima at ∼220 nm may indicate some low (<10%) α-helical content [42], in agreement with the secondary structure prediction obtained utilizing the Psipred tool (Figure 4B) [43,44].
For ATI1-N, the results are less clear. Although most amide and methyl proton signals collapse, characteristic of IDPs and different from fully folded regions, a broader dispersion of signals both in the methyl region and in the amide region was observed compared to ATI2-N (Fig. 5).
The latter is often observed in disordered regions with transient structure formation and/or transient long-range contacts, consistent with the more compact nature of ATI1-N compared to ATI2-N as suggested by the size exclusion chromatography results.
We next used the well-resolved indole NH peaks in the 1D 1H NMR spectra to query whether the ATI1-N and ATI2-N were sufficient for ATG8 interaction. First, we expressed wild type and W14A/V17A mutants of ATI1-N and ATI2-N (Figure 6B), and recorded 1D 1H NMR spectra to identify the peak corresponding to the indole NH of W14 in ATI1-N and ATI2-N (Figure 6C). We then recorded spectra in the presence and absence of purified ATG8f expressed in E. coli (Figure 6D,E), and examined the regions of the spectra with chemical shifts from the indole NH protons. This analysis showed clear line broadening of the W14 indole NH signal in the presence of ATG8f (Figure 6E), indicating that binding involves the N-terminal AIM of both ATI1-N and ATI2-N. We conclude that the N-terminal AIMs of ATI1 and ATI2 are necessary and sufficient for binding to ATG8f. We also conclude from the sharp peaks of the indole NH protons in the unbound state that the functional AIMs in both ATI1 and ATI2 reside in regions of high flexibility.

To test directly whether the N-terminal or C-terminal AIMs are functional, we first constructed point mutants in both putative AIMs in ATI2 and performed directed yeast two-hybrid assays with ATG8f. These experiments showed that ATI2 interaction with ATG8f was abolished upon mutation of the putative AIM in the N-terminal IDR, but not upon mutation of the putative AIM in the C-terminal part (Figure 6A). Thus, the N-terminal, but not the C-terminal AIM of ATI2 is necessary for ATG8 interaction in yeast.

The CD spectra of both ATI1-N and ATI2-N showed characteristic negative minima ∼200 nm, indicating a low content of secondary structure (Figure 4A). In addition, the broad minima at ∼220 nm may indicate some low (<10%) α-helical content [42], in agreement with the secondary structure prediction obtained utilizing the Psipred tool (Figure 4B) [43,44].
ATI2-N shows spectral properties of an IDP in all three regions: methyl protons show a narrow dispersion of chemical shifts above 0.8 ppm, amide protons resonate at chemical shifts within the interval 8.0 < δ < 8.7 ppm, and the three tryptophan NHs in ATI2-N give rise to sharp peaks reflecting high conformational flexibility (Fig. 5). Thus, together with the size exclusion chromatography and CD results, we conclude that ATI2-N is a highly disordered IDP with little or no long-range contacts.
We next used the well-resolved indole NH peaks in the 1D 1H NMR spectra to query whether the ATI1-N and ATI2-N were sufficient for ATG8 interaction.

There are 16 PCSK9 crystal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (www.rcsb.org; as of July 2018), which used recombinant PCSK9 with an intact prodomain for crystallization (PDB accession codes 2P4E, 3SQO, 4NE9, 5VL7, 5VLA, 5VLH, 5VLL, 5VLP, 2PMW, 3H42, 3P5B, 3P5C, 4NMX, 5VLK, 2QTW, 4K8R). They comprise apo-structures of full length and of C-terminally truncated PCSK9 and of complexes of PCSK9 with antibody Fabs and with peptidic inhibitors. Despite the different PCSK9 forms used and the different space groups, all structures share the common feature in that there is no recognizable electron density for the N-terminal region of the PCSK9 prodomain encompassing residues Q31–T60. This strongly suggests that this segment is in a disordered state.
The second PTM site is S47, which undergoes phosphorylation [30], [31] mediated by the Golgi casein kinase FAM20C [31], and the S47-phosphorylated PCSK9 was detected in human plasma [30]. The S47 phosphorylation appears to protect the acidic stretch from proteolysis [30].
the deletion of the acidic stretch creates a hyperactive PCSK9 displaying enhanced cellular uptake, increased potency of LDLR degradation, and stronger binding to LDLR [8], [37], [46]. This indicates that the acidic stretch has auto-inhibitory activity and functions as a negative regulator of PCSK9. The auto-inhibitory activity is not mediated by specific structural motifs. The acidic stretch could be shortened by a few residues, and up to six glutamic or aspartic acid residues could be charge-neutralized without changes in the auto-inhibitory activity, indicating that activity only depends on a minimal length and a minimal net charge [46].
Solution NMR experiments with peptides spanning the acidic stretch region demonstrated a propensity to adopt an α-helix.
The region with α-helical propensity detected by NMR is a close match to the α-helical segment observed in the crystal structures (37DYEELVLAL45)
This helical conformation is stabilized by binding to antibody 6E2 (Ab6E2), as demonstrated by crystal structures of Fab6E2–peptide complexes. This antibody, which specifically recognizes the helical conformation, bound to both acidic stretch-derived peptides and to intact PCSK9, suggesting that the disorder-to-order transition is a physiological property of PCSK9.
The structures of the complexes of Fab6E2–Pep1 (wild-type), Fab6E2–Pep4 (sY38:pS47), and Fab6E2–Pep6 (E32K) were determined at 2.25, 2.20, and 2.10 Å resolution, respectively (see X-ray metrics in Suppl. Table S1). Overall, these complexes are remarkably similar (Fig. 2a–c). The most striking feature in all structures is a well-ordered 2 1/4-turn α-helix formed by the 9-amino-acid central portions of the peptides (37DYEELVLAL45).
Immunoblotting of conditioned media demonstrated that Ab6E2 specifically recognized the prodomain of PCSK9 secreted by the three cell lines (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, experiments with the N-terminally truncated PCSK9, in which the acidic stretch residues Q31–A53 were deleted (PCSK9Δ53), indicated that the Ab6E2 binding site is located within the acidic stretch region. First, Ab6E2 did not detect the prodomain band of PCSK9Δ53 in immunoblotting experiments (Fig. 1a). Second, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments demonstrated that Ab6E2 bound to PCSK9 with a KD of 10.5 ± 1.2 nM, but did not interact with PCSK9Δ53 (Fig. 1b, inset).
To investigate whether the region deleted in PCSK9Δ53 (Q31–A53) contains the main antibody epitope, we synthesized a peptide corresponding to this sequence, except that the N-terminal Q31 was omitted. This peptide (Pep1) bound to Ab6E2 with a KD value of 3.8 μM (Table 1), confirming that the antibody epitope lies within the acidic stretch.
Remarkably, Pep2 with the sY38 modification had an approximately 2000-fold increased affinity to Ab6E2 (KD = 1.9 nM)
The Y38 residue undergoes O-sulfation mediated by the enzyme sulfotransferase [32,33].
There is strong evidence that the acidic stretch is involved in binding interactions. A recent study has implicated the acidic stretch in PCSK9 binding to LDL particles, which seems to regulate the activity of PCSK9 towards LDLR [45].
Consistent with the computer prediction that 3DL1-cyto is disordered, the1H-15N HSQC spectrum (Figure 1B) exhibits limited chemical shift dispersion in the NH dimension (8–8.6ppm).
The CON spectra of unphosphorylated SET-3DL1-cyto complexes with each individual SH2-domain (inmolar ratios of SET-3DL1:N-SH2 or C-SH2 at 1:0.2) show binding-induced reduction of intensities for peaks mainly from residues at or surrounding the N-ITIM (371-DPEEVTYAQLPHCVF-385).
The NMR spectrum of the complex with N-SH2 also shows minor peak intensity reductions for residues 400-PPTDTILYTELPN-412 spanning the C-terminal ITIM (Figures 7A, black andS3A, black to red) that are not evident in complex with C-SH2
3DL1binding to MHC-I ligand results in changes in local electrostatic interactions surrounding the TM and membrane-proximal region of 3DL1-cyto, which induces conformational changes in the N-terminal membrane-proximal region, including loss of transient ahelices, and hence liberating tyrosines from the membrane (Figures 8B and 8C) to be accessible for interaction with the N-SH2 of SHP-2 (Figure 8B) and phosphorylation by Src family PTK (Figure 8C). Phosphorylation of both ITIM tyrosines facilitates high-affinity interaction with both SH2 domains of SHP-2(or SHP-1) to fully activate these PTPs at the plasma membrane.

The 1H‐15N HSQC spectrum of hZIP4 ICL2 measured at 10°C [Fig. 1(c)] displays a narrow chemical shift dispersion in the 1H dimension ranging from 7.8 to 8.8 ppm. Reduced chemical shift dispersion in the 1H dimension is characteristic of IDRs compared to spectra for folded proteins.
Values for secondary chemical shifts were small (Supporting Information Fig. S3), suggesting that the ICL2 protein region exists predominantly as a random coil. Transient secondary structure populations for the disordered hZIP4 ICL2 were assessed using both the secondary structure propensity (SSP) score41 and the δ2D method.42 Both methods (Fig. 2) indicated that the ICL2 protein region is largely random coil with slight tendencies for regions of β‐strand between residues 460–469 and 484–490.
Previously, the hZIP4 ICL2 was shown to coordinate two zinc ions with the first zinc binding at a CysHis3 site and the second zinc binding at a His4 site.19 The single cysteine residue (C436) was responsible for the nanomolar binding affinity of zinc to ICL2.
The 1H chemical shift peak dispersion of zinc‐bound ICL2 remained narrow, indicating that the protein remained disordered upon zinc binding. The most prominent change in the spectra upon zinc addition was the disappearance of cross‐peaks. Analysis of the peak heights [Fig. 3(b)] revealed a metal‐dependent signal broadening with cross‐peaks for residues in the histidine‐rich region (residues 431–448), exhibiting ~50% reduction in signal with one zinc bound and complete signal broadening in the presence of two molar equivalents of zinc. 
The largest intracellular loop of ZIP4, ICL2, regulates the plasma membrane levels of the transporter in response to intracellular zinc levels.18 At low intracellular zinc concentrations, ZIP4 undergoes endocytosis from the plasma membrane, and as zinc concentrations increase, ZIP4 is ubiquitinated at the single lysine residue (K463) and proteolytically degraded.

Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that the M3M4 domain is intrinsically disordered, with only a small structural change induced upon Zn(2+) coordination.
Using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, metal binding affinity assays, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we demonstrated that the two Zn(2+) ions bind sequentially, with the first Zn(2+) binding to a CysHis3 site with a nanomolar binding affinity, and the second Zn(2+) binding to a His4 site with a weaker affinity.
Our data supports a model in which the intracellular M3M4 domain senses high cytosolic Zn(2+) concentrations and regulates the plasma membrane levels of the hZIP4 transporter in response to Zn(2+) binding.

The 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectra of the peptide show a poor spreading of the signals, as commonly observed for unfolded proteins
Secondary structure prediction was carried out with the program TALOS+ (Shen et al. 2009) using the HN, N, C′, Cα, Hα and Cβ chemical shift values as input data. The prediction suggests a random-coil conformation for the whole sequence with all the residues experiencing high mobility. Further and more detailed information on the dynamics of cytRAGE were provided by relaxation data. In particular, the characterization of fast motions occurring on picosecond-nanosecond time scales was performed by exploiting the spin relaxation properties of the amide 15N nuclei through R1, R2, and NOE experiments (see Fig. 3a, c, e). Random-coil polypeptides and flexible protein regions are characterized by fast local motions with NOE values below 0.5 or negative. In our construct of cytRAGE, that includes also three aminoacids of the transmembrane region and two of the thrombin cleavage site, the heteronuclear NOEs for all amino acids are close to zero or even negative at the C-terminal region (Fig. 3e). These NOE values indicate that all the isolated cytRAGE is highly flexible and unfolded in solution.
cytRAGE is reported to bind different intracellular proteins such as mDia-1(Rai et al. 2012), ERK-1/2 (Ishihara et al. 2003) and after phosphorylation by PKCξ, TIRAP and MyD88 (Sakaguchi et al. 2011).
The cytoplasmic domain of RAGE (C-terminal RAGE; ctRAGE) is critical for RAGE-dependent signal transduction. As the most membrane-proximal event, mDia1 binds to ctRAGE, and it is essential for RAGE ligand-stimulated phosphorylation of AKT and cell proliferation/migration. We show that ctRAGE contains an unusual α-turn that mediates the mDia1-ctRAGE interaction and is required for RAGE-dependent signaling.
When Arg-5 and Gln-6 are mutated to alanines, the loss of the binding epitope for mDia1 suppresses RAGE ligand-induced downstream phosphorylation of AKT and migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs).
To confirm the FH1-ctRAGE interaction surface, we made a ctRAGE double mutant in which residues Arg-5 and Gln-6 were changed to alanine to create R5A/Q6A-ctRAGE (Fig. 1A). Titrating unlabeled FH1 into [U-15N]R5A/Q6A-ctRAGE resulted only in small (<0.02 ppm) changes in the position of one amino acid residue, Arg-10. No other chemical shift changes or substantial broadening of the R5A/Q6A-ctRAGE peaks were observed, suggesting that the double mutant interacts with FH1 very weakly, with a KD well above 1 mm
The 15N HSQC spectrum of ctRAGE is well resolved but has limited chemical shift dispersion (Fig. 1B), indicating that the majority of the ctRAGE residues are disordered. 
Titrating unlabeled FH1 into uniformly 15N-labeled ctRAGE, [U-15N]ctRAGE, resulted in specific changes in the HSQC spectrum of ctRAGE
These changes suggest that residues Gln-3 through Gln-6 participate in the interaction with FH1. Peak broadening is characteristic of slow to intermediate exchange and suggests that the dissociation constant of the interaction Kd is <10 μm
the cytoplasmic domain of RAGE is phosphorylated at Ser391 by PKCζ upon binding of ligands. TIRAP and MyD88, which are known to be adaptor proteins for Toll-like receptor-2 and -4 (TLR2/4), bound to the phosphorylated RAGE and transduced a signal to downstream molecules.

In general, the SNAP25 loop region is disordered in solution. 
The hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiment shows that the hydrogen exchange rate of the residues in the middle part (107–131) is too fast to be detected in both buffer and bicelle. The hydrogen exchange rate of Nterminal residues is barely slower than C-terminal residues in buffer
in bicelle N-terminal residues, it is much slower than the C-terminal residues (Fig. 4C), which indicates that the N terminus of the SNAP25 loop interacts with membrane and induces structure that prevents hydrogen exchange of Nterminal residues.
First, membrane binding induces a disorder-to-order conformational transition of the SNAP25 loop involving the formation of an a-helix.
Upon interacting with the membrane, the proportion of a-helix in wild-type SNAP25 increases, and the proportion of random coil decreases
First, membrane binding induces a disorder-to-order conformational transition of the SNAP25 loop involving the formation of an a-helix.
We then expressed the SNAP25 loop region alone to simplify the spectra and acquired the 1H-15N HSQC in buffer and liposomes (Fig. 3 B). Assignments were made by using standard triple resonance experiments (Supplemental Fig. S10 B). In the membrane, many cross peaks from the N-terminal of loop region were broadened beyond detection. The crosspeaks intensity ratios of the SNAP25 loop in buffer and liposomes (Fig. 3 C) also show that the cross-peak intensity decrease caused by membrane binding is localized to the N-terminal of the SNAP25 loop, especially the cysteine rich domain.

To determine whether the membrane-induced SNAP25 conformational change affects its interaction with syx-1, we acquired 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra of uniformly enriched SNAP25 loop with or without unenriched syx-1 (1–264) in aqueous buffer and in liposomes (Fig. 6 A, B). Most of the spectrum is unchanged upon addition of syx-1
(1–264) in the buffer, but in liposomes, significant changes in signal intensities were observed in the C-terminal of the SNAP25 loop, and a number of resonances disappeared.
Second, the loop region mediates SNARE complex assembly through its interaction with the syx-1
SNAP25 loop region facilitates SNARE-complex assembly through promoting prefusion SNARE binary complex formation.
Palmitoylation of the 4 cysteines increases the affinity for the presynaptic membrane by increasing its hydrophobicity (20, 21, 23).
In this process, phosphorylation of the threonine (T)138 in the C-terminal of the SNAP25 loop influences the electrostatic interaction with syx-1, which explains how phosphorylation T138 mediates SNARE-complex assembly.

In these models, the distance from eIF4A residue 223 to residue 233 is  18 –20  Å,  which  can  be  accommodated  readily  by  the  linker polypeptide.
This structure and the intrinsic disorder of the carboxyl-terminal  domain  within  it  suggest  that,  in  solution,eIF4A can be a distended molecule and that the linker between domains  is  relatively  flexible  (although  it  does  not  have  an unusually  high  fraction  of  glycine,  alanine,  or  serine,  which  is characteristic  of  many  flexible  polypeptides).

The first 19 amino acids form an N-terminal intrinsically disordered region that extends from the canonical RRM fold. The disordered nature of the N-terminal segment is supported by the absence of NOE-derived distances within this region. In addition, chemical shift-based secondary structure propensity analysis revealed no preferential secondary structure propensity
Although full-length Rev is present in the crystals (SDS–PAGE of a crystal showed unaltered Rev mobility, with contaminants at ∼5%) (Fig. S2), only residues 9 to 65—the N-terminal domain (NTD)—were found to be ordered (Fig. 1A).
We further characterized the differences in IA and IIB binding modes using amide proton chemical shifts from 15N HSQC NMR spectra to monitor changes in the peptide-RNA interfaces. There is little peak dispersion of peptide resonances in the absence of RNA (Figure 5C), indicative of a largely unstructured molecule.

There is little peak dispersion of peptide resonances in the absence of RNA (Figure 5C), indicative of a largely unstructured molecule. However, we observe substantial amide peak dispersion in the presence of either IIB (red) or IA (blue) RNAs (Figure 5C), including the Hε protons of arginine side chains (Figure 5C inset). The overall upfield shifts observed in both 1H and 15N dimensions is consistent with stabilization of peptide α-helical structure upon binding (Wang and Jardetzky, 2002).

Given, the purine-rich internal loop of IA, we asked if this amino acid also is essential for IA binding. Interestingly, mutation of Asn40 had no effect on IA binding. Conversely, mutation of Arg41, which does not affect IIB binding (Tan et al., 1993), showed a reproducible 2-fold decrease in IA affinity (Figure 5A). R38A and R46A mutants showed similar 2-fold reductions in IA affinity but had no effect on IIB, while R43A, R44A, and W45A mutants bound IA like the wild type peptide. Helical wheel projections clearly show that different surfaces of the helix are used to recognize IIB and IA RNAs (Figure 5B).

Fig. 5 B shows that the [1HN],15N hetNOE values for Rev ARM in aqueous solution at pH 7.4 average 0.47 for residues T34–R50, consistent with a disordered peptide. In contrast, the hetNOEs of the Rev ARM peptide in complex with RRE StemIIB average 0.83 for residues T34–R50, and in 50% TFE average 0.77 for residues T34–R50.

Rev–GFP showed typical predominantly nuclear localization (>80% of fluorescence) (Fig. 2A). In contrast, RevM5–GFP fluorescence was apparent mainly in the cytoplasm, with less than 22% of total fluorescence in the nucleus (Fig. 2A).

Analysis of the nuclear translocation activity of NES mutant peptides demonstrated that peptides with PAAAA instead of PPLER were defective in both nuclear import (Fig. 8A) and export (Fig. 9), indicating involvement of this sequence in a bidirectional transport activity of the Rev–NES.
As shown in a gel mobility shift assay (Figure 2), the addition of Rev normally leads to formation of multimeric complexes with 35S-labelled RRE.
The experiment demonstrates the specificity of the Rev-importin-β interaction, as importin-β did not bind to the GST-Rev NLS mutant, or to GST protein. This was an unexpected finding, and identifies Rev as the first protein known to contain an NLS specific for the 97 kDa importin-β receptor, and not importin-α.
In the structure of MIM’s IMD, only one turn of this α-helix is observed for chain A, whereas the helix is fully missing in chain B, possibly due to local disorder in the structure
The crystal structure of the IMD of MIM (N-terminal 250 amino acids) was determined to 1.85 Å resolution, using the single anomalous dispersion method and X-ray data collected from a Se-Met-substituted crystal (Experimental Procedures and Table 1). The IMD forms a dimer (Figure 1B). The structure is well defined in the electron density map, except for three areas, which are disordered: the last six amino acids of chain A, the last eight amino acids of chain B, and amino acids Asp 155 to Ser 168 of chain B.
The overall structure adopts a globular shape comprising the MOB core domain made of nine α-helices (H1-H9) with the N-terminal extension, which forms a β-strand (the SN strand, residues 5-9) at the N-terminal segment of FLFGSRSS (residues 3-10) and a newly formed 4-turn α-helix (residues 24-38, hereafter referred to as the Switch helix), whereas the 10-residue linker between the SN strand and the Switch helix were poorly defined on the current map. Notably, the SN strand forms a β-sheet with the S2 strand (residues 95-98)

In the autoinhibited form of MOB1, the N-terminal extension forms the very N-terminal β-strand, the SN strand (residues 5-9), forming a β-sheet with the S2 strand, followed by a conformationally flexible linker and the Switch helix bound to the LATS1-binding site. The flexible linker runs along the LATS1-binding surface with electrostatic interactions. Thr12 is located at the conformationally flexible linker and Thr35 is located at the Switch helix.
Second, the subtle but important switch I conformational switch that reads out the bound GTP in Ras is completely missing in the RGK proteins as they are not observed in the electron density in both Rad and Rem2
Specifically, switch I is disordered in both nucleotide states for both Rad and Rem2, without any detectable interactions between protein and nucleotide.
For the RGK proteins, in the Rad:GDP crystal structure and particularly in the Rad:GNP crystal structure, switch II is largely characterized by static disorder.

The N-­terminal region (residues 1–39 in chain B and 1–31 in chain D) of GDNF was dis­ordered.
But the carboxy (C) terminus of PsbA (amino acids 335–344), important for the binding of the manganese cluster, appears to be disordered, as there is no density present in that region.

In the cryo-EM density map all the transmembrane helices of PsbA, PsbB, PsbC and PsbD are clearly visible and well defined. Whereas the helices are clearly visible, the termini are more difficult to assign.
For the extrinsic subunits the density for PsbO has been assigned. The β-barrel is well organized, but for the loops not all densities are resolved.
No electron density is associated with residues 320–327 of chain A or residues 319–330 of chain B, and these regions were omitted from the model.
No electron density was observed for residues 254–265.
The present structure does not contain a bound nucleotide, which is most likely the reason for the observed disorder in one of the nucleotide‐recognition loops (residues 254–265).
The Tyr64 side‐chain is disordered in the 18204011 structure, which is most likely due to lack of any bound NADPH.

The electron density for the fourth FN domain, although sufficient to indicate its approximate position, remained largely disordered throughout refinement; therefore, this domain was not included in the final model (fig. S2, A and B).

CaMBP1 and CaMBP2 are connected by a linker, that is disordered in the structure and that contains a conserved sequence motif (EEGIQLV; fig. S7) similar to the box2 motif of cytokine receptors, which is known to mediate recruitment of JAK family members through their FERM and SH2 domains

No clear electron density was observed for the two terminal domains except for the helix C in the C-terminal domain and an additional α helix flanking the N terminus of armadillo repeat 1.
The final crystal structure obtained from full-length zebrafish β-catenin protein crystals contains residues 126–681
Our crystal structures demonstrate that the N- and C-terminal domains of β-catenin are structurally flexible and clearly do not interact with the armadillo repeat domain with a static conformation.
In our crystal structures, the N- and the C-terminal tails are disordered despite the presence of intact β-catenin R1C and full-length β-catenin in respective crystals. Therefore, we conclude that the N- and C-terminal tails do not interact with the armadillo repeat domain with a specific conformation.

No electron density could be observed for FG loop residues Pro 119–Asn 131 in the P21212 map.
The structure of the Pirh2 CTD consists of a 30-residue disordered loop (residues 187–215) followed by a compact, globular fold that incorporates a single zinc ion with four cysteine thiol groups (residues Cys222, Cys225, Cys240 and Cys243) forming a tetrahedral zinc coordination (Fig. 2c). Residues 198 to 205 within the unstructured region showed some α-helical propensity based on their backbone NMR resonances.
In contrast, the 30 amino-acid linker between the RING and the CTD (~30 residues) gives Pirh2 great flexibility to bring together the ubiquitin-charged E2 enzyme with substrates.

In MG027, the loop region (between residue 78 to 99) that connects H4 and H5 is much longer than the corresponding loop in mt‐nusB (between residue 76 to 86) and other nusB proteins (Fig. 3). This loop is mostly exposed in the solvent region and is disordered in MG027 structure.
No density was visible for the first 11 N‐terminal amino acids and part of the loop region that connects α‐helix 4 (H4) and α‐helix 5 (H5)

An unstructured carboxy-terminal region follows helix α5 in each monomer and also packs against its dimerization partner.
The N- and C-terminal fragments (residues 37 to 74 and residues 469 to 556), which were truncated in Protein M TD as compared with Protein M, are likely disordered because the three-dimensional reconstructions of a Fab in complex with Protein M and Protein M TD by using negative-stain electron microscopy are nearly identical
Residues 455 to 468 in domain II of Protein M TD were flexible and not modeled.

These structural studies suggested that Protein M should preclude the ability of the antibody to bind to its antigen because it displaces or distorts the CDRs and/or may use its C-terminal domain to sterically block entrance to the antibody-combining site
Protein M blocks antibody-antigen union, likely because of its large C-terminal domain extending over the antibody-combining site, blocking entry to large antigens.
a comparison between ΔNΔS-SRPK2 (4.5 mg/mL black line) and SRPK2 (0.16 mg/mL blue line) samples indicates that the polydisperse full-length version in solution contains disordered regions, which are the ones that lack in the truncated version.
The scattering adjustment and pair-distribution function (Fig. 5) clearly depicts an elongated molecule profile in solution, because of the left side shift of the peak, as well as the tail on the q higher values [38]. The molecular dimensions RG (radius of gyration) and Dmax (maximum dimension) agree with each other between Guinier fit and p(r) calculations (Table 3). This elongated profile may suggest the contribution of the intrinsically unstructured regions SID and N-terminal for the oligomer formation.

CD analysis (Fig. 4C, Table 2) also revealed that SRPK2 is composed of random structure with some content of regular secondary structure. These data agree with a model where the bi-lobed folded kinase domain somehow coexists with the intrinsically unstructured segments

the bi-lobed folded kinase domain somehow coexists with the intrinsically unstructured segments, which act as binding regions for other proteins [19] and contribute to the kinase processive activity over its substrates [18,41]. It is worth mentioning that the full-length kinase was quite active under in vitro experiments in our hands (data not shown).
In addition, together with an also intrinsically unstructured N-terminal extension, SID plays a critical role in the kinase processivity ability. This is mainly reached due to the N-terminal and SID nucleotide release factor action, which favors the ADP release from the active site during the catalysis [21].

In the aSEC experiments (Fig. 8A), the full-length SRPK2 was eluted with 11.5 mL, which is consistent with an apparent molecular mass equal to 220 ± 10 kDa. This value indicates species ranging between dimer and trimer species. The RS was determined to be 50 ± 1 Å, which yielded an f/f0 of 1.7 ± 0.1 (considering a monomeric form for SRPK2), indicating a highly elongated particle [46]. This shape could be due to the presence of unstructured regions in the full-length recombinant protein. The RG/RS ranging from 1.3 to 1.5 also suggests the presence of unstructured regions [37].

The spectrum showed that the GRASP55 exhibited broad bands at ~203 and ~222 nm, suggesting the presence of the disordered as well as ordered secondary structure elements in the protein. The CD spectrum was further analyzed via CDSSTR routine using a set of various databases at Dichroweb server [33,34]. The results from CDSSTR deconvolution showed that fulllength GRASP55 has ~21% of α-helix, ~20% of β-sheet, ~17% of turns, and ~42% of disordered regions with the normalized root mean square deviation (NRMSD) of 0.19, which indicates, as already mentioned above, the presence of multiple disorder sites alongside well-structured regions. In addition, the protein family database analysis showed that the
full-length GRASP55 consists, as expected, of two domains: the GRASP (residues 1 –208) [17], including the two PDZ subdomains, and the SPR (residues 209 –452). Furthermore, the sequence-based prediction of protein disorder suggested that the C-terminal (SPR) domain of
full-length GRASP55 has high propensity of intrinsic disorder (Fig. 2), which is similar to the SPR domains of the CnGRASP and ScGRASP [29,30].
Based on these values, GRASP55 has Rh (measured from SEC-MALS) of the pre-molten globular conformation state. However, the far-UV CD studies and the crystal structure of the GRASP55 domain [17] showed that GRASP55 has a significant content of secondary structure in the native state. Moreover, the urea-induced denaturation studies showed that GRASP55
unfolds at high concentration (4 M) in a cooperative manner. These observations together suggest GRASP55 would not likely form a pre-molten globular conformation in the native conditions. It would rather either form a complex elongated conformation and/or its PDZ domains, influenced by the hydrophobic disordered Cterminal domain, would not fold properly.
Furthermore, the obtained Rh value of GRASP55 is much higher than what is expected for
a ~47 kDa protein (~3 nm) [40,41 ] based on the relation between Rh and molecular mass of different standard proteins. This is another indication that GRASP55 exhibits intrinsically disorder (ID) behavior in solution and agrees with our findings mentioned above. The ID behavior previously observed for lower eukaryotic GRASPs [29,30] thus seems to be a general property of GRASPs, spanning from lower to higher eukaryotes.

Golgi structure formation is regulated by phosphorylation during the cell cycle. GRASP65 is a major target of mitotic kinases on the Golgi (Wang et al., 2003); the SPR domain contains multiple phosphorylation sites that are phosphorylated by Cdk1 and Plk in mitosis (Tang et al., 2012), which inhibits GRASP oligomerization and results in Golgi disassembly (Wang et al., 2005). At the end of mitosis, GRASP65 dephosphorylation by PP2A (Tang et al., 2008) allows the reformation of GRASP trans-oligomers and restacking of newly formed cisternae (Tang et al., 2010). GRASP55 is regulated in a similar way (Xiang and Wang, 2010), though phosphorylated by the MAP kinase ERKs instead (Jesch et al., 2001; Feinstein and Linstedt, 2007; Duran et al., 2008).
Limited proteolysis by trypsin or chymotrypsin did not compromise the integrity of the heterotrimeric complex (Fig. 1b). It also left eIF5A and Ran intact, but cleaved Xpo4 within two poorly conserved loops comprising residues 241–260 and 931–948, respectively

The final model includes residues 7–179 of Ran and 15–152 of eIF5A. We modelled 1,052 of 1,113 residues of Xpo4, with a few residues missing from N- and C-terminus as well as from several loop regions between the HEAT repeats.

Even though this complex was stable and monodisperse, it did not crystallize–apparently because of disordered loops and termini: Indeed, the 14 N-terminal probably disordered residues of eIF5A (refs 36, 37, 53) not only turned out to be dispensable for complex formation (Fig. 1a), but also, their deletion allowed the RanGTP·Xpo4·eIF5A complex to crystallize in needle clusters.
The loop connecting helices α6 and α7, the loop between helices α4 and α5, and the loop that connects the β2-β3 strands each have disordered segments in one or more of the structures.
Region 206-249 of WzzB from Salmonella typhimurium connects helices α6 and α8 of the protein and corresponds to a disordered region not visible in the electron density (see Supplementary Figure S1)
In the final model, the electron density of residues Val16-Glu48 was invisible, and therefore, these residues were excluded.
Residues 149–169 from VPS36 and residues 1–25 from VPS22 are present in construct a, but could not be visualized in electron density and are presumed to be disordered.

Authors of the publication refer to the N-terminal 25 residues of VPS22 as VPS22-H0
The observation that both the Vps36 GLUE domain and the Vps22 H0 contribute to lipid binding in vitro suggested to us that a combinatorial mechanism evolved to drive high-affinity membrane targeting of ESCRT-II
The purified pseudo-intact ESCRT-II showed strong binding to liposomes made of synthetic lipids composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphoinositides (PIPs) (Fig. 4D–K), and bound weakly to PC:PE and PC:PE:phosphatidylinositol (PI) liposomes (Fig. 4B, C, K).
Authors of the publication refer to the N-terminal 25 residues of VPS22 as VPS22-H0
We have now found that the most N-terminal predicted helix of the core of each subunit (H0) is flexibly attached to the core assembly. We have been able to assign functions to each of these two regions. The VPS22-H0 participates in membrane binding, while the VPS36-H0 interacts with ESCRT-I.
The linker between the GLUE domain and the C-terminal core of VPS36 (residues 140–169) also contains a predicted α helix, which we refer to as VPS36-H0

The structure of the VEGFR-3 D4-5 homodimer suggests that proteolytic cleavage did not introduce significant changes in the D5 conformation, because it occurred in the C-D loop, which is disordered in the Cys466/Cys486 disulfide bridge
Residues 470–483 in the C-D loop were disordered and thus were omitted from the final model. VEGFR-3 D4-5 has an overall extended structure connected by the linker peptide, a salt bridge between Glu344 and Lys539, and a hydrogen bond between Glu391 and Tyr448

On the other hand, VEGFR-3 D1 has large disordered regions in the ligand complex, suggesting that it may interact with other binding partners in vivo, such as neuropilin-2 or the large N- and C-terminal propeptides of VEGF-C and VEGF-D.
Residues 28–134 of D1 are largely disordered, and we could build only the core of the apparent I-type Ig domain using KIT D1 (PDB ID code 2E9W) as a model.

In the Varp–VAMP7 complex, the final 24 residues of the VAMP7 cytosolic region (164–188), which are dispensable for binding to Varp (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 6), are not visible in the structure.
We crystallized a complex of K5 L2-2B and K14 L2-2B (Fig. 1a), which behaves as a functional assembly intermediate in vitro and in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 1a–c). The resulting structure includes residues Thr382– Gly476 of K5 and Ser332–Gly421 of K14 (Supplementary Fig. 1d). The L2 region and N-terminal end of the 2B domains of K5 and K14 are not well ordered in the crystal, and we did not model them.

Although variable in size (40–240 kDa) and primary structure, all intermediate filament proteins feature a central α-helical rod domain of conserved length and substructure comprising four heptad repeat– containing segments (1A, 1B, 2A and 2B) interrupted by three short linker sequences (L1, L12 and L2) at conserved locations
Although the amino acid sequence of the crystallized protein encompasses three domains—catalytic, disintegrin-like domain, and thrombospondin-like domain—the latter domain, residues 557–628, has no supporting electron density, presumably because of disorder.

In combination with the thrombospondin type I domain, the disintegrin-like domain was proposed to play an important role in recognition of substrate folding topology (Lauer-Fields et al. 2007).
No electron density was observed for residues 90-124.
The flexible loop of 55 residues that is not resolved in the electron density map of the FMNL2N–Cdc42 structure is directly preceding the second basic helix α9. Interestingly, this loop is missing in one splice variant of FMNL3, isoform 2, but otherwise conserved in all FMNLs

Electron density is apparent for all residues except those at the amino (133–140) and carboxyl (368–382) termini of the domain and within the loop between α helices 1 and 3 (the 1/3 loop, residues 157–165).
The figure-of-merit after phasing (before solvent modification) was 0.4, and the resulting experimental electron density maps were well defined, allowing the tracing of a model that consisted of residues 141–544 of the protein.
In free FANCI, it forms the β3-β4 sheet and part of it is disordered.
This region undergoes a complete conformational change on FANCD2 binding. In free FANCI, it forms the β3-β4 sheet and part of it is disordered.
These three sites map to the 37-amino acid FANCI-specific HD2 insertion at the I-D interface. This region undergoes a complete conformational change on FANCD2 binding. In free FANCI, it forms the β3-β4 sheet and part of it is disordered.
The five FANCI phosphorylation sites cluster at HD2, at and near the I-D interface. Only three of these sites have the ATM/ATR kinase consensus and are also conserved in vertebrates (Ser555, Thr558, Thr564 in mouse FANCI).
In the ID complex it instead forms two new helices (α26b and α26c) and a 10-residue extension to α27, becoming ordered in its entirety (Fig. 3C). This changes entirely the structural context of the phosphorylation sites. In free FANCI, they map to the disordered segment where they can be readily phosphorylated. In the complex, they end up at the start, middle and immediately after the α26c helix. Their side chains are embedded in hydrogen bond networks that anchor α26c in the FANCI structure and also contact FANCD2 (Fig. 3D and Fig. 2B bottom panel). The structure suggests that their phosphorylation may augment the intramolecular hydrogen bond networks, stabilizing the FANCD2-bound conformation of this region, and may also result in new FANCD2 contacts

Our data implicate the ID complex in recognizing DNA structures that result from the encounter of replication forks with an ICL. The complex may function in stabilizing and protecting these DNA structures, and also in providing specificity for the initial incisions around the ICL by directing the FA-associated nuclease to these sites.

The final model of Rpp20/Rpp25 (R/Rfree = 0.20/0.24) was obtained from data to 2.25 Å and, as a result of disordered regions in both the N- and C-termini and between the β3 and β4 antiparallel beta strands, consisted of residues 29 to 59, 63 to 114, and 119 to 140 of Rpp20 and residues 22 to 109 and 125 to 157 of Rpp25
Since the N- and C-terminal regions of both Rpp20 and Rpp25 were disordered in the crystals and our initial datasets were limited in resolution to approximately 3.0 Å, it was difficult to establish the correct amino acid register of the protein models

Seven domains (Ig1-6 to FnIII7) could be unequivocally resolved in the electron density maps; however, the C-terminal MAM8 domain was not visible and most likely highly mobile and accommodated in the solvent channels of the crystal.
The MAM8 domain was not visible in the electron density maps, probably due to a flexible FnIII7-MAM8 linker.
As no electron density was detectable for residues 1–14 and 497–572 they were excluded from the final model.
As no electron density was detectable for residues 1–14 and 497–572 they were excluded from the final model.
Analysis of the oligomerization and structural states after the deletion of residues 472–572 by thrombin in vitro revealed discernible differences which, in addition to protein phosphorylation or dephosphorylation events, might be crucial to regulate the function of CRMP and its interaction with other signalling proteins.
Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) are a family of cytosolic phosphoproteins that were originally investigated as signalling mediators of semaphorin 3A
Several phosphorylation sites are localized in the C-terminal disordered region of CRMP, i.e. a phosphotyrosine at residue 504, a phosphothreonine at residue 509 and phosphoserines at residues 521, 522, 537, 540 and 542 (PTM-sites position as reported in UniProt).
To characterize the bases of CRMP action, we determined the X‐ray structure of murine CRMP1. Limited proteolysis of CRMP1 (residues 8–572) demonstrated that the C‐terminal segment (approximately 75 amino acids) is proteolytically susceptible (data not shown).
Electron density was visible for residues 15–490, consistent with the proteolysis results described above.
Collapsin response mediator proteins (CRMPs) are cytosolic phosphoproteins involved in neuronal differentiation and axonal guidance.

When compared with the relatively elongated low-resolution structure of full-length PCPE-1 in solution (Bernocco et al., 2003, Kronenberg et al., 2009), the ability of CUB1 and CUB2 to interact in this way in the complex confirms that there is considerable flexibility in the inter-domain linker.

Although the termini are mobile and flexible with negative hNOE values, residues in the central portion of the inactivation gate peptide have positive hNOEs indicative of stable structure.
The glycine- and proline-rich regions flanking the folded core are unstructured in both peptide constructs, consistent with their proposed role as hinges in the intact channel
The structured subdomain contains residues functionally implicated in mediating and regulating inactivation and is flanked by regions proposed to serve as hinge regions for the inactivation gate.
The NMR solution structure of the isolated inactivation gate reveals a stably folded core comprised of an α-helix capped by an N-terminal turn, supporting a model in which the tightly folded core containing the latch motif pivots on a more flexible hinge region to occlude the pore during inactivation.

With the exception of disordered residues at the N terminus, the mRev1 CTD is well structured, with mean pairwise r.m.s.d. of 0.47 and 0.94 Å for the backbone and heavy atoms, respectively
The mPol κ RIR(546–616) displays a typical 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of a disordered peptide, with amide resonances showing a narrow chemical shift distribution.

By analyzing mPol κ RIR amide resonances that experience substantial perturbations upon binding to the mRev1 CTD, we have identified a 23-residue RIR peptide of mPol κ(560–582) that not only binds to the mRev1 CTD tightly but also causes identical resonance perturbations for the mRev1 CTD as the longer peptide. This 23-residue peptide was subsequently used to investigate the mRev1 CTD-Pol κ RIR interaction.

The binding of the mRev1 CTD similarly induces folding of the disordered Pol κ RIR into a three-turn α-helix, starting from Phe566 and ending at Ile575
The eukaryotic Y-family polymerase Rev1 is an essential scaffolding protein in translesion synthesis. Its C-terminal domain (CTD), which interacts with translesion polymerase ζ through the Rev7 subunit and with polymerases κ, ι, and η in vertebrates through the Rev1-interacting region (RIR), is absolutely required for function.
Our combined structural and biochemical studies reveal two distinct surfaces of the Rev1 CTD that separately mediate the assembly of extension and insertion translesion polymerase complexes and provide a molecular framework for developing novel cancer therapeutics to inhibit translesion synthesis.
In the crystal structure, two N-terminal residues and 29 C-terminal residues starting from N371 are disordered and the corresponding electron densities for these regions are not visible
Therefore, Ser385 and Ser393, which had been confirmed by the mass spectroscopy as the phosphorylation sites, were mutated to aspartic acids to mimic the charge and length of the phosphoserine residue.
However, the MALDI mass spectroscopy data have indicated, without ambiguity, that the phosphorylation sites on hCASQ2 are Ser385 and Ser393, but not Thr372.
In addition, the back-to-back interface has the polyanionic C-terminal disordered tail in it, which is composed of residues from 371 to 399 in the case of hCASQ2. Thus, this disordered tail contains both phosphorylation sites, Ser385 and Ser393 (Fig. 7). The twenty-six out of twenty-nine residues in the disordered C-terminus of hCASQ2 are acidic residues.
In addition, small angle X-ray scattering determined that in high concentrations of Ca2+, S385D:S393D exists in more compact forms of oligomer than those of unphosphorylated hCASQ2 (Fig. 5a, b). Therefore, the disorder-order transition through phosphorylation-induced helix formation delays Ca2+-dependent aggregation probably through providing more stable back-to-back interface.
Therefore, phosphorylation of two serine residues in the highly acidic C-terminal tail increases not only the negative charge in the back-to-back interface, but also establishes a disorder-order transition through the formation of extra-helices and tight interaction with existing positive patches.
The authors report the exact phosphorylation sites of hCASQ2 for the first time. It was also showed that phosphoserine mimicking double mutant of hCASQ2 has a substantial increase in its Ca2+ binding capacity, solubility and α-helix content, probably due to the extra negative charge and order-disorder transition in the back-to-back interface.
In the crystal structures of both CASQ1 and CASQ2 from various species [20, 39, 46], two distinct dimerization contacts are observed: front-to-front and back-to-back, which involve the N-terminal and C-terminal residues, respectively. Those interfaces form the basis of dimer, tetramer, and possibly further polymers of CASQ. Not only do the observed polymers have the morphology inferred for the physiologically relevant aggregation [23], but these two interfaces also provide the basis for a mechanism to couple Ca2+-binding and polymerization

In addition, the experimental approach with equilibrium dialysis and atomic absorption spectroscopy shows that the hCASQ2 double mutant shows a similar Ca2+ binding capacity up to a Ca2+-concentration of ~6–7 mM (Fig. 6). Above this Ca2+ concentration, S385D:S393D displays significantly increased Ca2+-binding capacity (Fig. 6). Coincidently, the bifurcation point of Ca2+ concentration between double mutant and others in turbidity assay (Fig. 4) is similar to that of Ca2+-binding capacity curve
The MPK6 crystals contain two protein chains in the asymmetric unit. Amino acid residues 70–75 (part of the glycine-rich loop), 213–214 (part of the phosphorylation lip), and 366–374 (part of the L16 loop) in chain A and amino acid residues 215–224 (phosphorylation lip) and 285–287 (part of the MAPK insert) in chain B were not resolved in the electron density maps.

Although 21 residues of the linker region between the D/D domain and the CNB-A domain of each R-subunit (residues 59–81) are still missing in our structure, several features are clear.
Although 21 residues of the linker region between the D/D domain and the CNB-A domain of each R-subunit (residues 59–81) are still missing in our structure, several features are clear.
The unusual feature of our structure was that we were capable to visualize both the D/D domain and the CNB domains simultaneously. Structures of these domains for different R-subunits were solved previously only separately. The extended flexible linker between these domains prevented crystallization of the full length R-subunits. RES
The entire linker segment that joins the D/D domain to CNB-A is classified as an intrinsic disordered region, and embedded within this segment is the inhibitor site (IS) that docks to the active site cleft of the C-subunit in the holoenzyme.

In B, the long loop region, residues 260–285, invisible in the open conformation, is highlighted in red.

In contrast, the same region in the closed conformation had clear electron density corresponding to a long loop, residues 260–285 (Fig. 1B). The appearance of the long loop coincides with the change in the orientation of the Trp224 side chain, from pointing away to pointing toward the binding pocket, forming a hydrogen bond with the β-phosphate oxygen atom of the bound UDP (Fig. 1B).

We present here the crystal structures of human β4GalT7 in open and closed conformations. A comparison of these crystal structures shows that, upon
manganese and UDP or UDP-Gal binding, the enzyme undergoes conformational changes involving a small and a long loop.

The present human β4GalT7 crystal structures show that the β4GalT7 enzyme undergoes conformational changes upon binding with manganese and UDP or UDP-Gal. This conformational change involves small and long loops containing residues Gly223-Trp224 and His259 to Gly284, respectively.

Two CISK-PX fragments were used for the crystallographic studies. One contained the PX domain (short-PX, residues 7–126) and another contained both the PX domain and the linker between the PX domain and kinase domain (long-PX, residues 7–160)
The density for this linker region, however, cannot be observed in the electron density map, which indicates that the linker region is much more dynamic compared with the PX domain in the crystallized CISK fragment. Our DLS data on different fragments of CISK-PX have shown that the fragment containing only the PX domain (residues 7–126, 14.34 kDa) is monomeric (DLS molecular mass, 16.68 kDa), whereas the fragment containing the PX domain and the linker region (residues 7–160, 18.00 kDa) is in an oligomeric form with DLS molecular weight around a dimer (35.14 kDa).

Nevertheless, the high tendency for CISK-PX to dimerize in the presence of the linker region implies that dimerization may play an important role in CISK membrane localization and regulation.
Furthermore, biochemical studies reveal that CISK-PX dimerizes in the presence of the linker between the PX domain and kinase domain, suggesting a multivalent mechanism in membrane localization of CISK.

In addition to the linker region, the PX domain itself might also contribute to part of the dimer interface. At least two models exist for the dimeric state of CISK-PX. In the first model, the linker facilitates the dimerization via linker-linker interaction; in the other model, the linker from one CISK molecule interacts with another CISK-PX domain

In the murine 2.7 Å crystal structure that we are presenting here, the FG-loop is disordered, however, well-ordered in a recently reported homologous rat ZP-C structure.
Such a flexible and temporarily-modulated association of the EHP segment with the ZP domain has been proposed to control the polymerization of ZP domain-containing proteins. Our findings suggest that this flexibility also extends to the ZP domain of TGFR-3 and might facilitate co-receptor ligand interaction and presentation via the adjacent FG-loop.
In all ZP structures solved to date, the EHP segment folds back onto the ZP-C subdomain via a flexible FG-loop
In case of the bridging residues 730 to 744 in the FG loop we observe residual, however non-interpretable, difference density hinting that this segment remained largely intact in the crystals and that the lack of defined electron density is caused by conformational disorder in this segment

The residues corresponding to the β5 strand and the following β5–α4 loop are absent from the electron density map due to disorder.
No electron density was observed for P135, E348–S357 (the x‐linker), the N‐terminal GPLGS cloning linker and, additionally, residues E323–L334 for chain A and E322–A336 for chain B that correspond to the strand β5 and β5–α4 loop in the b′x crystal structure.
The β5 strand, which normally forms β‐sheet with the β4 strand, is disordered in the dimeric structure.
PDI, also known as PDIA1, is the founding member and the most studied protein in the PDI family. PDI contains four thioredoxin‐like domains abb′a′, where a denotes catalytic domains containing CxxC motifs and b stands for non‐catalytic domains, with a 20‐residue x‐linker between b′ and a′ domain and a C‐terminal acidic tail.

The separation of actin subunits in the FMNL3–actin structure shows that each actin monomer can be held in place only through interactions with FH2 subunits, which suggests that flexibility in the FH2 linker region could allow the actin subunits to remain in contact with the FH2 domains while sliding past one another during elongation
For another 12 amino acids in MolA (45–56) and another ten amino acids in MolB (47–56), there is no visible density in the electron-density maps. As will be discussed later, this unfolded region coincides with the region that discriminates between the open and closed conformation.
Helix α3, connecting helix α2 to helix α4 in the closed conformation (not shown), is completely disordered in the open conformation and is therefore not visible.

The B-factor plot of the main-chain atoms, shown in Fig. 2, clearly indicates that the missing residues are located in a region of higher than average B factors.
MJ PSP is partially unfolded in the open state. Binding of the substrate L-­phosphoserine causes the refolding of this unfolded region and this mechanism provides specificity for the substrate. The subsequent Mg2+-dependent hydrolysis of L-phosphoserine to L-serine is catalysed by MJ PSP in the closed conformation.

There are 28 residues preceding α-helix 1, which were not built in the AtSK2 structure due to a lack of corresponding electron density
Most of the AtSK2 LID domain between α-helix 7 and α-helix 8 (residues 212-227) was not modeled in the AtSK2 crystal structure due to a lack of corresponding electron density. This region contains the substrate binding and putatively catalytic arginine (Arg117) of the LID domain
The apo-AtSK2 structure adopts the open conformation, as indicated by the orientation of the disordered LID domain away from the active site and the spacing of the ESB and NB domains away from the RC domain relative to the closed conformation MtSK structure.
The AtSK2 structure can be divided into four domains [Fig. 2(B)]: the reduced CORE (RC) domain comprising the central β-sheet and flanking α-helices, the nucleotide binding (NB) domain, which includes the phosphate binding loop (P-loop/Walker-A motif), the disordered LID domain, which contains catalytic and substrate binding residues, and the extended shikimate binding (ESB) domain, which includes a modified SK-type Walker B motif and several other substrate binding residues.
The extended loop region of the LID domain was not modeled in the AtSK2 structure.

The N-terminal domain (residues 57–131) is only partially defined (residues 57–84 are flexible) and interacts with the active site of the neighboring monomer.

A hinge region links the N‐terminal FMN‐binding domain to the rest of CPR.
Two forms of ATR2 exist in the crystal. Form A (chain A) has the electron density for all four domains except a 43‐residue fragment of the hinge region; Form B (chain B) has the electron density for three domains, but lacks that for the FMN‐binding domain (Fig. 2A). The structure of ATR2 is described based on Form A unless noted otherwise.

Only residues 14–44 were visible in the electron density map but most strikingly they formed a trimeric coiled-coil.
The final model contains 305 (residues 1−26, 30−221, and 225−311) out of 322 residues in the protein.

The flexibility of the carboxy-terminal tail of AtErv1 in the crystal structure and the requirement for the shuttle disulfide in activity assays led us to speculate that the shuttle disulfide region may be modular and sufficient for substrate recognition.
When the carboxy-terminal 18 residues of AtErv1 were not seen in the electron density maps, we sought to determine if they were present in the crystals or if the protein had suffered proteolytic degradation during crystallization.
Nevertheless, the AtErv1 crystal structure provides further support for the general flexibility of shuttle disulfide regions of eukaryotic sulfhydryl oxidases and, coupled with mutagenesis, confirms that dynamic polypeptide segments determine the substrate specificities and reaction rates of the ERV/ALR sulfhydryl oxidases.
In addition, both have a second disulfide bond on a flexible loop or tail of the protein, positioned so that it can either approach the active-site disulfide or extend into solvent.
The AtErv1 shuttle disulfide is in a region of the structure that is disordered and thus apparently mobile and exposed. This feature may facilitate access of protein substrates to the shuttle disulfide.

The shuttle disulfide is required for oxidation of protein substrates by AtErv1
Although the location and context of this "shuttle" disulfide differs among family members, it is proposed to perform the same basic function of mediating electron transfer from substrate to the enzyme active site. We have determined by X-ray crystallography the structure of AtErv1, an ERV/ALR enzyme that contains a Cys-X4-Cys shuttle disulfide and oxidizes thioredoxin in vitro, and compared it to ScErv2, which has a Cys-X-Cys shuttle and does not oxidize thioredoxin at an appreciable rate. The AtErv1 shuttle disulfide is in a region of the structure that is disordered and thus apparently mobile and exposed. This feature may facilitate access of protein substrates to the shuttle disulfide. To test whether the shuttle disulfide region is modular and can confer on other enzymes oxidase activity toward new substrates, we generated chimeric enzyme variants combining shuttle disulfide and core elements from AtErv1 and ScErv2 and monitored oxidation of thioredoxin by the chimeras. We found that the AtErv1 shuttle disulfide region could indeed confer thioredoxin oxidase activity on the ScErv2 core. 
The A1R transmembrane domain regions and extracellular and intracellular loops (ECL and ICL, respectively) are well defined, with the exception of 7 residues in ICL3 and the last 25 residues of helix 8.
The structure generally shows a well-defined electron density map for the four helices of the two EF-hand motifs of each subunit except for residues from 51 to 71 of monomer D, comprising helix III and part of the loop between helix III and IV. This is consistent with a very high degree of mobility of these regions in the crystal lattice, as also indicated by the B factors.

We identified a conformational change in Munc18-1 domain 3a (residues 295–358); these residues form the predominant interaction site with Sx1 helices H3 and Hc in the Munc18-1–Sx1 closed structure (6). In that structure, Munc18-1 residues 295–358 form a bent hairpin, but in the Munc18-1 structure reported here the hairpin is unfurled, involving a 180° rotation and > 25 Å translation of backbone residues to form an extended antiparallel helical hairpin.
Munc18-1 domain 3a may be flexible in the unbound solution state and adopt an ordered conformation upon interaction with binding partners. We showed that a domain 3a peptide interacts with preformed SNARE complex, as evidenced by an increase in helicity consistent with coiled-coil formation.
Domain 3a variability suggests this region may be unstructured in the unbound solution state and possibly adopts a helical structure upon interaction with partners

We used CD spectroscopy to analyze whether a peptide corresponding to this region of Munc18-1 (residues 326–359) could interact with the SNARE ternary complex (formed from Sx1 H3 helix, His-SNAP25, and VAMP2). The CD spectrum from the mixture of peptide and SNARE complex (Fig. 4D) reveals an increase in helicity of about 8% in comparison with the SNARE complex. We would expect an increase in helicity of 11% if all 34 peptide residues form coiled-coil interactions with the helical residues of the SNARE complex. These results indicate that the isolated domain 3a peptide interacts with the SNARE complex and that this interaction induces coiled-coil formation in the peptide.

The structure of N-peptide bound rat Munc18-1 adopts an extended domain 3a conformation that may preclude closed Sx1 binding yet remain compatible with binding open Sx1 and SNARE complexes.
Post-SET is fully structured only when bound to the substrate peptide (Figure 2A), or to a small molecule inhibitor [32], but the density is incomplete otherwise (Figure 2B–D). This implies that Post-SET is naturally flexible, which may be important for peptide turn-over, as recently proposed

The N- and C-terminal end regions required for tetramerisation and heparin binding, respectively, are highly flexible.
Both the N- and the C-terminal ends are incomplete in the structural model reported here, as there is weak electron density corresponding to these regions (modelling at 0.7σ contour level was not reliable), signifying either a greater flexibility for these parts of the molecule or the possibility that the protein has partially degraded during crystallisation.

Among the missing residues at the N-terminus is Val24, which is known to be involved in oligomerisation of SOD3; in particular, the mutation Val to Asp in tetrameric mouse SOD3 causes it to become dimeric, while the reverse mutation in natively dimeric rat SOD3 converts it to a tetramer

Some of the solvent-exposed parts of the PDP1c molecule are disordered and not included in the model. These are the residues 111–114, 152–157, 304–314, 374–404 and 418–442 that probably form flexible loops in the PDP1c molecule.

In total, 80% of the total sequence was comprised of the clear density that initially enabled the tracking of the correct position of the atoms in the main chain; however, the density was poor in some areas of the map that are known to contain flexible regions in the homologous structures. The missing polypeptide fragments included regions 1–6, 44–55, 88–98 and 200–204 in the dehydrogenase domain, and 373–387, 451–457 and 593–598 in the hydratase domain.

The structure is too disordered to model from residues 232 to 242 in subunit A, from  residues 232 to 241 in subunit B, and from residues 233 to 240 in subunit C
The crystal structure of DltA in the absence of any substrate was observed to have a noticeably more disordered pocket for ATP which would explain why DltA has relatively low affinity for ATP in the absence of any D-alanyl carrier.
We also determined the structure of BcDltA in the absence of any substrate. This structure is noticeably more disordered than previously reported DltA structures, which may explain the enzyme’s lower affinity to ATP in the absence of the other two substrates.
The electron density map indicated several disordered regions (Ser-153 to Pro-159, Pro-363 to Glu-367, Arg-397 to Glu-413, Lys-433 to Tyr-440) with the corresponding regions in the starting model highlighted in magenta in Figure 2B.

The C-terminal part of this flexible inter-domain region also contains a β-hairpin which has been observed to interact with CoA in homologous acetyl-CoA synthetase
The longest such disordered region is between Arg-397 and Glu-413, which contains the inter-domain hinge residue Asp-399, interacts with β-phosphate of ATP, and forms the pantetheine channel. Possibly, this important region remains disordered in the presence of saturating D-alanine, therefore providing an explanation for the similar values between the above mentioned K D (0.43 mM) and the K M (0.46 mM) for ATP, in the presence of saturating D-alanine but in absence of CoA.
There are 3 monomers of Angptl3 in the asymmetric unit. The N-terminal His-tag as well as the C-terminal 6 amino acids are not visible. In addition, there are two regions within the fibrinogen-like domain (Lys389 - His391 and Pro420 - Arg429 in the A-chain) for which the electron density is either missing or not of sufficient quality to allow tracing of the chain, suggesting the presence of flexible loops.
Residues not included due to the absence of any electron density include chain A (20-31, 349-356), chain B (20-32, 234-240, 349-356), chain C (20-25, 349-356), and chain D (20-32, 235-240, 350-356).

These results showed that the GALDBD-6b protein was capable of activating transcription and that the acidic region of 6b was required for activation
6b Protein Affects the Transcription of Plant Genes
The  6b  protein  did  not  include  any  obvious  DNA  binding motif, but it did include an acidic region that is required for its  interaction  with  NtSIP1  and  for  the  activation  of  transcription by 6b. Thus, 6b might function as a transcriptional coactivator/mediator  by  interacting  with  other  proteins  in the  transcriptional  machinery.

In this study, we report that 6b interacts with the tobacco nuclear protein NtSIP2, whose predicted sequence is significantly similar to that of the TNP1 protein, which is encoded by the transposable element Tam1 of Antirrhinum majus. Most NtSIP2 localizes to the nucleoli, and 6b localizes to a subnucleolar region as well as the nucleoplasm, suggesting their functions in the nucleolus; 6b could act as a histone chaperone similar to the nucleolar histone chaperones of animal cells, nucleophosmin/B23 and nucleolin.
Mutant AK6bΔA that lacked the acidic region did not bind NtSIP2 (unpublished data).

Protein 6b Has Histone Chaperone–Like Activity
To examine the putative histone chaperone activity of 6b, we first performed supercoiling assays with relaxed and closed-circular DNA, recombinant 6b (or human NAP-1 [hNAP-1]) that had been purified from E. coli, and core histones prepared from HeLa cells.
Our observations indicated that 6b had histone chaperone–like activity in vitro but that the activity of 6b was lower than that of hNAP-1 in our assay system.
As shown in Figure 5C, the mutant derivatives of AK6bΔA and AK6bΔC, which lacked tumorigenic activity (Figure 1B), had no histone chaperone–like activity.
In the AK6bΔA sequence (the 564-bp sequence), the 63-bp sequence corresponding to the entire acidic region of 6b (amino acid residues 164 to 184) was deleted from the 6b coding sequence (the 627-bp sequence corresponding to 208–amino acid residues plus the termination codon).
Although there is up to 20% of the mature form of the protein in the crystals, the invisibility of this loop is probably due to its flexibility in both the precursor and mature forms of the enzyme, since the loop would be visible if it were ordered only in the precursor form.
In the crystal structure of 4-S, the loop from residues 407 to 422, which is anchored at one end by a disulfide bridge (Cys405– Cys447) and terminates at one of the cleavage sites, is not readily visible in the electron density.
The structure of AzI has several disordered regions. These include the first seven residues at the N terminus, the last 13 residues at the C terminus, and three disordered loops: amino acids 160–167, which connect β7 to α7; 294–310, connecting β11 to β12; and 330–334 between η3 to β13.

X-ray crystallography failed to provide structural information about the ODC C-tail because this region is disordered in the structures of both the ODC–Az95–2281 heterodimer and the ODC homodimers
This N-terminal segment of ODC (residues 1∼16) is hereafter referred to as the N-latch (Fig. S4 and Fig. 1A), whose conformation is locked in the ODC homodimer by binding across the barrel and sheet domains to mask a prospective proteasome-interacting surface. Az1 binding causes both significant repositioning of the two domains of ODC and rearrangement of the interface contacts (Fig. 2 B and C), which disrupt their interactions with the N-latch and lead to its displacement.
Intriguingly, in ODC–Az95–2281, the fragment becomes fully exposed and thus appears to be suitable for mediating proteasome association due to the disruption of the homodimer interface and an Az1-induced structural transition of the ODC N terminus, which becomes disordered and invisible in the electron density map upon Az1 binding

Intriguingly, in ODC–Az95–2281, the fragment becomes fully exposed and thus appears to be suitable for mediating proteasome association due to the disruption of the homodimer interface and an Az1-induced structural transition of the ODC N terminus, which becomes disordered and invisible in the electron density map upon Az1 binding
The N-terminal fragment (residues 1–16, enclosed by black box), which undergoes an order-to-disorder transition upon Az1 binding, is referred to as the N-latch.
MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing analysis using an ODC protein sample retrieved from dissolved ODC–Az95–2281 crystals both show the intactness of the ODC N terminus (Fig. S3), providing convincing evidence that the exposure of this presumably proteasome-interacting surface of ODC is caused by an Az1-induced order-to-disorder transition of the ODC N-terminal segment (Fig. 2), rather than by an experimental artifact that resulted from nonspecific proteolysis during sample preparation and crystallization.

Comparing the spectra of the full-length and truncated homodimers showed that the ODC C-tail is indeed unstructured, being highly flexible and solvent exposed, which gives rise to well-resolved NMR peaks. Moreover, the signals that correspond to the ODC C-tail remained unchanged in the presence of Az95–2281 (Fig. 3B), suggesting that heterodimerization most likely has no effect on the properties of this region.
The following residues were missing in the structure: 1–9, 161–167, 294–310, 342–346, and 433–448 in AzIN and 110–125 and 220–228 in Az1 110–228.

Bcl-B is distinguished from other Bcl-2 family members through an insertion of an unstructured loop between helices α5 and α6.
Residues 107–121 are absent from the electron density for Bcl-B, indicating their flexibility.
A point of similarity between Bcl-B and Boo, which differentiates them both from other Bcl-2 proteins, is the presence of the unstructured α5–α6 loop.
Clear and continuous electron density was obtained for residues 2–106, and 122–164 of Bcl-B and 53–76 of Bim, whereas the residues constituting the α5–α6 loop (residues 107–121) lack clear electron density and were presumed disordered.
The model was built for all residues except disordered loop regions, which include residues 188–198, 223–227, 351–359 and two C-terminal residues.
The Ig1 domain of one mNecl-4 ectodomain (chain C) interacts with mNecl-1 whereas the electron-density of the Ig1 domain of the other mNecl-4 ectodomain (chain A) was essentially missing, indicating that this domain is highly flexible, likely due to the lack of contacts with other molecules in the crystal.
The final model includes aa 32-279, while aa 21-31 are disordered.
The final structure contains 247 residues, with the N-terminal 20 and eight residues in a mobile loop not visible, and 20 water molecules.

Residues 1–5, 40–57, and 126–140 were not modeled because of the weak or absent electron density of these regions.
Region 40-57 corresponds to a disordered loop between β3 and β4
Residues 1–5, 40–57, and 126–140 were not modeled because of the weak or absent electron density of these regions.
A region that contributes to the HRASLS2 and HRASLS3 membrane interaction is the 40–57-amino acid segment between β3 and β4.
Thus, the reason for the disorder observed in this particular region could stem from the lack of a proper interfacial environment in the protein crystal, as lipid membrane interactions have been shown to stabilize amphiphilic helices
A region that contributes to the HRASLS2 and HRASLS3 membrane interaction is the 40–57-amino acid segment between β3 and β4
This in turn suggested an amphiphilic helix with a hydrophobic interface mainly composed of Val-50, Met-51, and Leu-54 in HRASLS3 and Val-50, Leu-51, and Leu-54 in HRASLS2 that could interact with the nonpolar core of a bilayer
The authors suggest that interaction of this region with a lipid bilayer could promote its re-folding as documented for many other amphiphilic helices, although they don't test this hypothesis
This loop is presumably unstructured in solution as the electron density for the corresponding amino acids was only observed for one of the four Dnmt2 molecules in the asymmetric unit, and this loop adopted a defined conformation due to formation of crystal contacts with another Dnmt2 molecule in the crystal lattice.
Residues 1–24 and 257–269 could not be built into the final refined model owing to a lack of electron density, implying that the extreme N-terminal region and the loop connecting α11 and α12 are highly flexible.
Although localised in the C-terminal actin-binding domain (C-domain; residues 181–295), this disordered region is not directly involved in the binding of actin since the actin-binding sites are at amino acids 1–123 (ABS1), 193–254 (ABS2) and 279–295 (ABS3)

Crystallographic analyses of the core enzyme indicated that the C-termini, normally flexible, were constrained by interactions with the shortened N-termini that arose from the loss of residues 1-37.

Notably, EBS adopted an autoinhibition mode to mediate its switch in binding preference between H3K27me3 and H3K4me3.
To investigate the in vivo relevance of the C-terminal autoinhibition loop, we generated a C-terminal deletion mutant and found that it failed to complement the early flowering of ebs (n = 6 independent transgenic lines; Fig. 4a,​,bb and Supplementary Fig. 6d), despite having a much higher protein level than wild-type EBS
According to the 4.9 Å EM map, we could only build poly-Alanine chains for N-terminal portion of Rictor and five α-helices of mSin1. The rest portions are invisible in the EM map possibly due to their intrinsic flexibility, which is consistent with secondary structure prediction

Rictor has an N-terminal armadillo (ARM) repeat cluster (~900 residues), followed by a large unstructured region
The C-terminal half of Rictor and most of the mSin1 portion are invisible in the EM map, which might result from their intrinsic flexibility.
The C-terminal portion of Rictor could not be assigned in the EM map possibly due to its flexibility.
Moreover, mSin1N could bind to the Rictor N-terminal portions containing residues 1–595 or 1–905 and C-terminal portion containing residues 905–1708

Full-length mSin1 bound to the N-terminal portion (residues 1–905) or C-terminal portion (residues 905–1708) of Rictor
The ProA-tagged mSin1 could pull out endogenous mTOR, indicating a direct interaction (Supplementary information, Figure S2b, lanes 1, 3, 4, and 7). Full-length mSin1 and two C-terminal truncations could also pull out the endogenous mTOR in the presence of Rictor
mSin1 bound to mLST8 (lane 4) and the interaction was enhanced when mTOR was overexpressed (lane 6).
The PH domain of mSin1 inhibits mTORC2 activity and this autoinhibition is released in the presence of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3)
Moreover, both termini (residues Met1–Ser20 and Pro101–Asn106) are not included in the structural calculation process for their conformational flexibility.
The first 49 residues of AtIAMT1 in this particular set of crystal structures form a mobile loop. In fact, recognizable electron density attributable to residues 1 to 24 is noticeably absent from the refined AtIAMT1 crystal structure, which also lacks a bound IAA substrate.
We have solved the structure of the ID2 homodimer HLH domain (residues 24–82) at a 2.1Å resolution, coupled to a stabilizing 14 amino acid linker region (LKPSFLVQSGDIAS).
The final model of hBCATc-ox·4MeVA comprises 358 residues (22-45, 47-193, and 199-385) for subunit 1, 358 residues (24-194 and 199-385) for subunit 2, 2 PLPs, 4MeVAs, and 351 water molecules. The average thermal factor of the main-chain atoms is 24.3 Å2. No interpretable electron density was observed for the residues that are not listed above.
The C-termini of both FlhD monomers (residues 83-116) are completely disrupted by crystal packing, implying that this region of FlhD is highly flexible.
Residues 83–116 in both chains were not interpretable and were not initially modelled.
Protruding from the core are two flexible arms, each composed of ≈ 34 residues of the C‐terminus of each monomer
Thus, our model suggests that the entire C‐terminal sequence (83–116) of each chain is mobile and flexible in the FlhD dimer, so much so that its folding energy is less than the energy necessary to crystallize the protein.
Also, residues 83–116 in chain B and residues 99–116 in chain A are disrupted by crystal packing and cannot be modelled. Thus, this part of the FlhD dimer must be highly flexible in solution and, therefore, its structure should be malleable
The C-termini of both FlhD monomers (residues 83-116) are completely disrupted by crystal packing, implying that this region of FlhD is highly flexible.
Thus, our model suggests that the entire C‐terminal sequence (83–116) of each chain is mobile and flexible in the FlhD dimer, so much so that its folding energy is less than the energy necessary to crystallize the protein.
Thus, the unusually tight packing of protein in this crystal form prevents both C‐termini from adopting a well‐defined structure. The implication is that the C‐terminus is very flexible: sufficiently flexible that the forces involved in crystal packing are greater than the forces folding this region of the FlhD protein.
In the orthorhombic crystal structure, the first 11 residues, including the His tag  and the spacer sequence before Met1,and the last 11 resides (residues 218-228) are invisible, probably owing to disorder.
The C-terminal segment from residue 218 to the end was poorly defined in each monomer and was not included in the atomic model.
The current atomic model of Rev-erbβ contains residues (396–476) with disordered N and C-terminal tails (residues 386–395 and 477–479).
Careful examination of the structure shows that the region corresponding to the disordered region 470–479 in molecule A exhibits relatively high thermal displacement parameters in all other molecules in both crystal forms, indicating structural mobility of this region

As described above, most of the electron densities associated with the potential actin–tropomyosin interfaces are ambiguous. These include the inhibitory region (residues 137–148) and the C-terminus of TnI (residues 163–210 in Tn52KA and 192–210 in Tn52KB), and the C-TnT (residues 272–288).

In Pro-RIP, the internal inactivating region Ala163–Asp189 is very rich in acidic residues. Our structure shows that the internal inactivating region consists of a flexible loop (Ala163–Ala179) and a long α-helix (Ala180–Ala188)
In the precursor, the inactivation region is found on the protein surface and consists of a flexible loop followed by a long alpha-helix. This region diminished both the interaction with ribosome and cytotoxicity, but not cellular uptake.

Among the sequences to be removed during the activation of maize RIP, the 25 aa internal region (known as internal inactivation region) is the most crucial, as removal of this region increases the activity by at least 600-fold, whereas removal of the N- or C-terminal region only increases the activity by 6- or 5-fold, respectively
These indicated that the internal inactivation region of Pro-RIP might obstruct the protein to dock onto the ribosome.
Therefore, the internal inactivation region may serve the purpose of preventing the maize RIP from attacking its cognate ribosomes in vivo.
The internal inactivation region is removed in the active form

This loop is largely disordered, indicating that it is somewhat mobile, and it contains the positively charged arginines at positions 163, 165, and 167. 
Arginines 163, 165, and 167 within the loop are unique to TREX2 and strongly contribute to its high affinity for DNA
The position of the active sites in the TREX2 dimer and the adjacent flexible region provides an explanation for the tight DNA binding and robust catalytic activity of the TREX2 enzyme.
Involvement of all three of the arginines positioned at 163, 165, and 167 on the flexible loop is supported by additional mutagenesis studies that demonstrate contributions to DNA binding by each of the individual arginines in TREX2.
These data suggest a model for TREX2 catalysis in which the negatively charged phosphodiester backbone of DNA is first bound by the positively charged arginine residues present on this flexible loop, and the DNA is subsequently moved into the active site for catalysis.
Together, the efficient excision of 3′-terminal nucleotides facilitated by a presumed two-metal ion mechanism of phosphodiester bond cleavage similar to that proposed for the exonuclease of E. coli DNA polymerase I and the efficient binding and movement of the DNA substrate into the active site by the α6–α7 flexible loop can account for the robust nature of the TREX2 enzyme.

Furthermore, the structure suggests a model for activation of TPP II involving the relocation of a flexible loop and a repositioning of the active–site serine, coupling it to holocomplex assembly and active site sequestration.
Density for most of the structure was observed; the disordered regions were limited to a few predicted loop regions, which were not modelled due to lack of density or weak density (Fig. 1a, c). These loops include residues Asn90–Pro112, loop “L1” (Glu408–Gly417), which is highly conserved and unique to the TPP II family, residues Gly442–Gln456 of loop “L2” (Gly441–Gly460), which is likewise highly conserved and contains active–site residue Ser462 at its C–terminal side, and loop “L3” (Lys1027–Lys1098) which is substantially shorter in human TPP II and is prone to nicking in both purified Drosophila and human TPP II with no observable effect on activity.

Crosslinking data indicate that the NELF-A flexible "tentacle" reach the DSIF DNA clamp, in particular SPT4 and the SPT5 NGN domain, and is involved in the binding of Pol II subunits RBP1, RBP2, RBP9 
Negative elongation factor (NELF), is composed of the four subunits NELF-A, -B, -C (or isoform NELF-D that lacks the first nine NELF-C residues), and -E. One of the two flexible "tentacles" is in NELF-A, the other flexible "tentacle" is in NELF-E. They contact DSIF, composed of SPT5 and SPT4
Additionally, NELF possesses two flexible 'tentacles' that can contact DSIF and exiting RNA.

Residues 189-528 of NELF-A form a flexible tentacle that binds Pol II and DSIF.
The NELF-A tentacle, but not the NELF-E tentacle, is required for pause stabilization.
Elongating Pol II can be blocked or paused in the promoter-proximal region. Paused Pol II is stabilized by two factors, the 5,6-Dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) sensitivity inducing factor (DSIF), composed of subunits SPT4 and SPT5, and the negative elongation factor (NELF), composed of the four subunits NELF-A, -B, -C (or isoform NELF-D that lacks the first nine NELF-C residues), and -E.
Residues 139-363 of NELF-E form a flexible tentacle that extends over DSIF near exiting RNA.
Density for NELF-E was largely lacking except for the N-terminal helix α1.

The NELF-E tentacle encompasses the RRM domain, which is not required for Pol II association, but can bind RNA hairpins
Residues 139-363 of NELF-E form a flexible tentacle that extends over DSIF near exiting RNA.
Thus, the NELF-E tentacle is not required for pausing but may bind nascent RNA to help recruit NELF to pause sites.
The C-terminal 25 residues of SAP/SH2D1A were unstructured in both complexes. The 1H–15N HSQC cross-peaks corresponding to this region of the protein were very narrow and intense, indicative of rapid and unhindered tumbling in solution (Li et al., 1999). Moreover, no intermediate- or long-range nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) could be observed beyond residue 105. Consequently, only residues 1–107, corresponding essentially to the SH2 domain region of the protein (residues 6–102)
The last 24 residues at the carboxyl end, which includes these two cysteines, are not visible in the electron density map.
The last 24 residues at the carboxyl end, which includes these two cysteines, are not visible in the electron density map.
Ribonucleotide reductase is the only enzyme that catalyses de novo formation of deoxyribonucleotides and is thus a key enzyme in DNA synthesis. The radical-based reaction involves five cysteins. Two redox-active cysteines are located at adjacent antiparallel strands in a new type of ten-stranded alpha/beta-barrel, and two others at the carboxyl end in a flexible arm.
Together with the disordered carboxyl end of the peptide this provides strong support for the theory of a  flexible tail that transfers reducing equivalents from the surface to the active site by a thiol exchange reaction.
Each monomer consists of a C-terminal domain connected by a flexible linker to an N-terminal AdoMet-binding domain.
The monomer of TrmD consists of two discrete domains connected by an extended flexible linker region of 11 residues 
A disordered peptide linker spans the 23 Å distance between residues 161 and 173.
The disordered linker peptide that connects the two domains is expected to be in an extended conformation to span the available distance and must lie in and along one edge of the groove passing over the AdoHcy-binding site.
We have previously indicated that an unstructured peptide linker exists spanning residues 162 to 172 and running over the cofactor-binding site in the extended cleft formed by the monomer–monomer interface.

The structure also features three loops, L1 (seven residues), L2 (17 residues) and L3 (seven residues); the longest loop L2 is disordered and is absent from the density map
The final structure does not include 19 of the 113 residues, including the seven last C-­terminal residues, as these regions were disordered in the crystal.
This disordered region correspond to 12 aa of the L2 loop
The E-loop of Phe97Ala mutant was largely disordered
The E-loop containing the Phe97Ala mutation  was largely disordered  in both monomers, in contrast to the same loop of the wt (Fig. 4c),indicating that Phe97 was responsible for the decreased flexibility of the E-loop as an anchor point

Our results suggest that the CH domain, which is loosely connected to the MO domain by a flexible linker and is far away from the catalytic site, couples F-actin to the enhancement of redox activity of MICALMO-CH by a cooperative mechanism involving a trans interaction between adjacently bound molecules.
The structures of two crystal forms, native 1 and 2 (Table 1), show electron density for residues 8–486 of the MO domain and residues 506–554 and 562–614 of the CH domain (Fig. 1).

The first 11 N-terminal residues are disordered, while residues 12–20 assume a conformation resembling that found in the low-pH structure of GadB (1PMM).
Residues 449–502 are disordered in the Gad1 crystal structure at pH 5.5. This C-terminal domain consists of a linker of varying lengths in different plant Gads (residues 449–470 in Gad1, Fig. 3), followed by the well-characterized and conserved CaMBD (residues 471 – 502).

The CaMBD is located at the C-terminus of the protein and is preceded by a flexible stretch of ∼20 residues. This results in the highly flexible binding mode for attached CaM molecules.

The N-terminal domain (residues 1–57, Fig. 1 and see Fig. 6) has an important role in the formation and stabilization of the dimer and hexamer.
CaM activates Gad1 in a unique way by relieving two C-terminal autoinhibition domains of adjacent active sites, forming a 393 kDa Gad1–CaM complex with an unusual 1:3 stoichiometry.
Many plant species like soybean, tobacco, petunia and Arabidopsis, express Gad proteins containing a 30 – 50 residue C-terminal extension compared to the bacterial enzyme sequence. The additional domain has been identified as a CaMBD15 and autoinhibits the Gad protein in the absence of Ca2+/CaM, whereas Gad activity is upregulated upon addition of Ca2+/CaM.

In both structures, residues 425–445 and 473–663 are modeled, whereas no ordered electron density was observed for residues 446–472.
This incompatibility and the observation that the C terminus of CHFR and the phosphate and ribose groups of the ligand are only ordered in the CHFR-C·AMP2 structure suggest that one molecule of the AMP2 is bound to the protein, with the caveat that we were not able to model the entire ligand linker motif, presumably due to its flexibility.

We examined the phosphorylation of purified Lgl2 treated with purified aPKCι by mass spectrometry (the same sample that was used for crystallization), and found seven phosphorylated serine residues on the 10–11 loop (S641, S645, S649, S653, S660, S663, and S680), which include the previously reported sites
We present a structure-derived model for dual GTPase membrane attachment that highlights the potential ability of Rab GTPases to reach binding partners at a significant distance from the membrane via their unstructured and membrane-anchored, hypervariable domains.
An important aspect of our model is the possibility that Rab proteins may reach some distance from the membrane (up to ∼10nm) to bind to an effector protein, due to the unstructured nature of a Rab protein's ∼30 residue, membrane anchored, C-terminal hypervariable domain

Annexin A2 (ANXA2) has a versatile role in membrane-associated functions including membrane aggregation, endo- and exocytosis, and it is regulated by post-translational modifications and protein-protein interactions through the unstructured N-terminal domain (NTD).
Annexins consist of a disordered N-terminal domain (NTD, ANXA2 residues 2–33) (Figure 1A) followed by a conserved C-terminal core domain (CTD, ANXA2 residues 34–339) comprising four annexin repeats
Phosphorylation of Tyr24 anchors the NTD to the core and inhibits membrane aggregation
In contrast, pTyr24 anchors the NTD to the CTD and hampers the membrane-bridging function.
LUV aggregation induced by wild-type ANXA2, ANXA2DNTD, ANXA2S26E, and ANXA2S12E-S26E was similar, while the amplitude of the turbidity change caused by ANXA2pY24 was 11-fold smaller than that caused by native ANXA2
The unstructured N-terminal domain (NTD) is visible in complex with S100A4
Furthermore, it was shown that S100A4 binding requires the entire NTD

One of the most extensively characterized properties of ANXA2 is its interaction with S100A10 forming a heterotetrameric complex (calpactin I).
To evaluate quantitatively the interaction of S100A4 with ANXA2, we performed fluorescence polarization (FP) binding studies using Fl-ANXA22−15 and Fl-ANXA22−33 fragments, as well as full-length Fl-ANXA2 variants
As expected, S100A10 bound tightly to both NTD fragments, as well as all ANXA2 constructs, with a Kd of 10–40 nM
The results of the label-free isothermal titration calorimetry measurements confirmed that S100A4 binds to ANXA2 with moderate affinity (Kd ≈ 11 and 8 μM for the NTD and full-length ANXA2, respectively) and with a stoichiometry of one ANXA2 chain to an S100A4 dimer (Figures 3F and 3G).
We also studied the effect of S100 binding and/or protein phosphorylation on ANXA2-mediated liposome aggregation. We found that Tyr24 phosphorylation reduced the conformational fluctuation of the C-NTD and it hampers the ability of ANXA2 to aggregate phosphatidylserine-containing large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs).
Modulation of ANXA2-Mediated Liposome Aggregation by Protein Phosphorylation and S100 Binding
Since we demonstrated that the pTyr24 side chain clamps the C-NTD to the CTD, a possible explanation for the tyrosine phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of LUV aggregation is that the concave side of ANXA2, which is supposedly responsible for ANXA2-ANXA2 interactions during membrane bridging, is masked by the C-NTD in the membrane-bound form as well (Figure 6B).
C-NTD Phosphorylation Modulates ANXA2 Stability
Based on our crystal structures, MD simulations, and LP and DSF experiments we can conclude that the flexibility of the C-NTD and the stability of the CTD are clearly interrelated and oppositely regulated by Tyr24 phosphorylation and Ser26Glu phosphomimicking mutation.
There was no clear electron density beyond residue 509 indicating that this putative α helix does not have a unique position and is not part of the little finger sub-domain.
Langevin dynamics simulations, and small-angle X-ray scattering-we show that the C-terminal region is partially unstructured and has high conformational flexibility.

The C-terminal region mediates interactions with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and other translesion synthesis proteins such as Rev1. This region contains a ubiquitin-binding/zinc-binding (UBZ) motif and a PCNA-interacting protein (PIP) motif.
A region that contributes to the HRASLS2 and HRASLS3 membrane interaction is the 40–57-amino acid segment between β3 and β4
This in turn suggested an amphiphilic helix with a hydrophobic interface mainly composed of Val-50, Met-51, and Leu-54 in HRASLS3 and Val-50, Leu-51, and Leu-54 in HRASLS2 that could interact with the nonpolar core of a bilayer
Thus, the reason for the disorder observed in this particular region could stem from the lack of a proper interfacial environment in the protein crystal, as lipid membrane interactions have been shown to stabilize amphiphilic helices
The authors suggest that interaction of this region with a lipid bilayer could promote its re-folding as documented for many other amphiphilic helices, although they don't test this hypothesis

Electron density for the activation loop between the DFG motif and Leu-1245 is not visible in the structure, suggesting that residues 1225–1244 of the activation loop are disordered following phosphorylation.
The crystal structure of the unbound kinase domain phosphorylated at Tyr-1234 and Tyr-1235 shows that activation loop phosphorylation leads to the ejection and disorder of the activation loop and rearrangement of helix αC and the G loop to generate a viable active site.
Upon phosphorylation, the G loop adopts an extended conformation (blue) that requires ejection of the activation loop (gray) and reveals the ATP-binding site.

Upon phosphorylation, the G loop adopts an extended conformation (blue) that requires ejection of the activation loop (gray) and reveals the ATP-binding site.
One of the more striking differences observed between the unbound, phosphorylated c-Met structure and the structure observed in the presence of compound 1 is the nearly complete ordering of the activation loop, including the phosphate groups of Tyr(P)-1234 and Tyr(P)-1235 (Fig. 5). Only a short region of the activation loop remains disordered (residues 1240–1243). Upon loop stabilization, the phosphotyrosine residues form electrostatic interactions: Tyr(P)-1234 interacts with Lys-1232 and Lys-1253, and Tyr(P)-1235 interacts with Arg-1227 and His-1238
Upon phosphorylation and ejection of the activation loop, the G loop adopts a remarkably different conformation that involves a movement of 9–11 Å for the Cβ atoms of Arg-1086, His-1088, and Phe-1089 (Fig. 3A). The extended β-hairpin conformation of the G loop is incompatible with the presence of the activation loop in the unphosphorylated state. This structural transition removes the active site obstruction seen in the unphosphorylated structure by the G loop side chains of Arg-1086, His-1088, and His-1089 and thus relieves an autoinhibitory feature of the unphosphorylated kinase.

Two insertions in the rat protein are clearly seen, but the N-termini (residues 1−20) and C-termini (residues 301−307) are disordered in both crystal forms.
Both the N- and C-termini were disordered in the first rTS structure, and residues r1−r20 and r301−r307 were therefore left out of the final model.
The structure is a modified doubly wound alpha/beta sheet with flexibility in the active site, including a disordered loop in the apo structure, which is ordered in the ternary complex structure.
The apo models include all protein atoms for residues 1-109 and 133-212, whereas the ternary model includes residues 1-209.

The evidence supports a view of synapsin I as an ATP-utilizing, tetrameric protein made up of monomers that have a flexible, extended N terminus.
Only two domains are conserved in all synapsins: a short N-terminal A domain with a single phosphorylation site for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and CaM Kinase I, and a large central C domain that binds ATP and may be enzymatic. We now demonstrate that synapsin phosphorylation in the A domain, at the only phosphorylation site shared by all synapsins, dissociates synapsins from synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, we show that the A domain binds phospholipids and is inhibited by phosphorylation. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which proteins reversibly bind to membranes using a phosphorylation-dependent phospholipid-binding domain. The dynamic association of synapsins with synaptic vesicles correlates with their role in activity-dependent plasticity.
The phosphorylated site corresponds to Ser9 of Synaptin I.
Here, we identified seven in vivo O-GlcNAcylation sites on synapsin I by analysis of HPLC-purified digests of rat brain synapsin I. The seven O-GlcNAcylation sites (Ser55, Thr56, Thr87, Ser516, Thr524, Thr562, and Ser576) in synapsin I are clustered around its five phosphorylation sites in domains B and D.
The glycosylated sites correspond to Ser55 and Thr56.

No electron density was observed for TM residues and much of the α(V) linker. α(V)β(3)-AB and α(V)β(3)-1TM demonstrate flexibility in the linker between their extracellular and TM domains, rather than the previously proposed rigid linkage.

The first 39 residues of each TSC1 helix (residues 939–977) formed a single helix, whereas the last 15 residues were not visible in our electron density map.
To reveal how TBC1D7 interacts with TSC1, we determined the crystal structure of the TSC1 TBC1D7-binding domain (residues 939–992) in complex with near full-length TBC1D7(19–293), using the Se-Met single wavelength anomalous dispersion method
ITC showed that full-length TBC1D7 and N-terminal truncated TBC1D7 (residues 19–293) interacted with TSC1(939–992) with comparable affinities: 0.4 and 0.2 μm, respectively
Pulldown experiments using the purified proteins showed that TSC1(939–992) was sufficient for interacting with TBC1D7 (Fig. 1a). TBC1D7 and TSC1(939–992) formed a stable complex and co-migrated in SEC.
The TSC1-TBC1D7 interaction is important for the stability and activity of the TSC complex, a crucial regulator of the mTORC1 pathway that controls cell growth (25). Here we reveal the structural basis of the TSC1-TBC1D7 interaction.
Although the amino-terminal 19 amino acids are disordered in solution, the remainder of the molecule has a well defined structure that shares many features displayed by other long-chain four-helix bundle cytokines.
Essentially all restraints are localized to residues 20 to 185; we have reported that the amino-terminal 19 residues of IL-6 are extremely flexible, as evidenced by observed 15N T2 values (Xu et al., 1996), and thus fail to yield any restraints useful for 3D structure determination.
The disordered N-terminal 19 residues correspond to the region 28-46 of the protein, since the authors cloned the gene lacking its signal peptide.
The N-termini of IL-6 and G-CSF are disordered so that the crystal structures of both begin at the start of helix A, whereas the N-terminal residues of hGH are ordered and are involved in receptor binding.
In the L2 regions (shown in blue in Fig. 1 [triangle]), the full-length HsDMC1 structure has a slightly larger section of disordered amino-acid residues (residues 271–289).
About 30% of the Dmc1 protein (the N-terminal region, Dmc11–82, and the putative DNA binding region (Loop 2), Dmc1 271–289) was uninterpretable from the calculated electron density maps, suggesting that these regions are either highly flexible or have multiple conformations.

Residues 11 to 23, 47 to 56, 64 to 68, 92 to 96, 130 to 138, and 266 were not modelled due to weak electron density.
Given that the N-terminal residues 1–11 are easily accessible and prone to proteolytic degradation, the non-paired region of H1 in the four-helix bundle (residues 1–14) might be flexible in solution.
Consistent with this observation, the N-terminus of Rogdi is vulnerable to proteolytic degradation
The three loop regions (residues 64–68, 92–96, and 212–221) are disordered in the two RogdiH molecules; however, the electron density for RogdiL is relatively well ordered throughout the protein chain. 
Of these, the following residues were not modelled due to weak electron density: Residues 48 to 55, 211, 235, and 286 to 287 in the first copy; residues 48 to 55, 211, and 286 to 287 in the second copy; residues 48 to 56, 64 to 68, 92 to 96, 212 to 221, and 284 to 287 in the third copy; residues 48 to 56, 64 to 68, 94 to 96, 181, 212 to 221, and 284 to 287 in the fourth copy
In an apparent series of propagated changes, several other nearby loops are also disordered, including another in D1 (residues 64–65) and a larger region in D2 (residues 256–267). In total, 23 residues in two domains are affected by induced disorder in the structure of G291R mutant
Through comparison with the high-resolution crystal structure of wild-type (WT) human PGM1, also reported here, we find that both mutant enzymes suffer from regions of induced structural disorder and other effects resulting from the dramatic change in physicochemical characteristics at the site of mutation.
Two independent glycine to arginine substitutions (G121R and G291R), both affecting key active site loops of PGM1, are found to induce regions of structural disorder, as evidenced by a nearly complete loss of electron density for as many as 23 amino acids.
Binding 3PG causes a 13 degree rotation that partially closes the structure and causes helix 13, which is disordered in the unliganded structure, to stabilize.
Residues 372–386 are disordered in the monomer bound with 3PG, similar to the unliganded PGK2 structure; however, these residues are clearly ordered, forming a helix, in the monomer with ATP bound.

The residues Gly472 to Phe488 of the active site region are either disordered, or in an open conformation in the MenD oxoglutarate complex structure, but adopt a closed conformation in the MenD ThDP complex structure.
The most significant difference between the oxoglutarate complex and the ThDP complex structure, presumably caused by the binding of ThDP, is the movement of the loop (Tyr489 to Asn494) and the disorder region Gly472 to Phe488
Active site pocket of EcMenD anchoring ThDP and Mg2+ shows a disordered region in the apo and oxoglutarate complex structures, and an ordered region in the ThDP complex structure.

The region between β15 and α21, residue 472–488 (A chain) and residue 471–493 (B chain) is found disorder or have a weak density map, corresponding to the high flexible loop binding region for the cofactor ThDP.
The final model, which includes residues 9–562 of Efr3-N8–562 except for a disordered loop comprising residues 217–232, was refined to Rwork = 23.11% and Rfree = 25.56% with good geometry
In addition, a loop between residues 347 and 363 is disordered.
Apart from the disordered area (loop 347–363), this region in TS has the same fold as in the other enzymes.
The crystal structure of NL2A reveals that the A splice insertion, which encompasses residues 152–169, is positioned in the β6–β7 loop. The inserted sequence is mostly disordered in the structure; electron density is observed only for residues 152–158 in one protomer and is entirely absent in the other
In the NL2A structure, the majority of the 17 residues inserted at the A site are disordered, making it difficult to predict the potential contribution of the A insert to NRX binding at this time.
The function of P-gp requires the flexibility of its two halves, which are joined by a mobile linker that is disordered in all mP-gp structures reported so far.

The linker (residues 627–683) between NBD1 and TM7 is not observed and presumed to be disordered. Residues 1–33 and 1272–1276 at the N- and C- termini are also not observed.
The N-terminal half of the protein (blue) and the C-terminal half (yellow) are connected by a flexible linker region (black dashed line) that is disordered in the structure.

At 3.0 Å resolution, the cryo-EM map was of sufficient quality for de novo atomic model building in Coot (Emsley et al., 2010) except for the disordered N terminus (198–215), a loop (296–301) within the extracellular polycystin domain, S2–S3 loop (494–503), and C terminus (695–703).

The only significant difference between the molecules is the conformation of a loop, Ala19–Gln34, which is largely disordered in the apo protein but becomes well ordered in the presence of bound substrate or product.
Like other members of the AT superfamily of enzymes, AstB possesses a flexible loop that is disordered in the absence of substrate and assumes an ordered conformation upon substrate binding, shielding the ligand from the bulk solvent, thereby controlling substrate access and product release.

An electron density map calculated from diffraction data collected from this crystal revealed a well defined substrate molecule bound in the active site (Fig. 3a). As a result of substrate binding, all of the residues in the Ala19–Arg32 loop, which were disordered in the native crystal structures, were now clearly defined in electron density.

The substrate and product bind in a polar cleft of AstB shielded from the solvent by a 13-residue-long (Ala19–Arg32) loop unique to this family. This loop is disordered in the apo form of the enzyme, suggesting that AstB exists in an open conformation in the absence of a bound ligand. Comparison of the substrate-free and substrate-bound structures shows that the flap closes over the entrance to the substrate-binding tunnel and buries the N-succinylarginine. Subsequently, the flap must open to allow N-succinylornithine to depart.
This is a disorder to order transition regulating substrate/product binding/release in an enzymatic reaction
By CD spectroscopy, each of these isolated peptides is minimally folded (Figure 1B), with only minor indication of a thermal denaturation unfolding transition for His6-Rna15p(127–232). NMR spectroscopy data are also consistent with peptides that are either unfolded or in a heterogeneous molten-globule state (Figure 1C). This is evident by the poor dispersion in the 1H chemical shift values as is seen with disordered peptides

The C-terminal monkeytail domain from Rna14p and the hinge region from Rna15p display a coupled binding and folding mechanism, where both peptides are initially disordered. 
Excellent stability and evidence of a single well-folded complex by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy is seen with samples from bacterially coexpressed Rna14p(626–677)/Rna15p(127–232)
The authors show that while the individual Rna15p and Rna14p proteins are disordered and show low NMR dispersion, the co-expressed complex is folded and has a highly dispersed spectrum (Figure 1C)

Genetic data confirm that mutation of residues within the minimal heterodimer region inhibit association of full-length Rna14p and Rna15p.
Mutants with destabilized monkeytail-hinge interactions prevent association of Rna15p within CF IA. Conservation of interdomain residues reveals that the structural tethering is preserved in the homologous mammalian ... proteins of the CstF complex.
The interaction between the monkeytail and hinge domains creates a high affinity link that joins Rna14p and Rna15p together in a tight complex, and from sequence analysis a similar tether is likely formed between the metazoan orthologs
Using TAP-tag purification we have found that the loss of this tether specifically results in a separation of Rna15p from CF IA.
Most importantly, without Rna15p the RRM domain is no longer present in the CF IA complex, causing loss of specific RNA-binding for CF IA, even though the RRM domain itself is not directly affected by either mutation.
As the residues in segments at the N-terminal end (4–21) and in two long loops (117–119 and 163–166) and the last two residues have weak or uninterpretable densities, they were assumed to be flexible.
The crystal structure of the NAP domain (residues 4–301) was determined by the multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) phasing technique (Experimental Procedures and Table 1) . The structure, missing the first eighteen disordered residues, is composed entirely of ten α helices and connecting loops, all of varying lengths.
However, in the full-length Prx4 structure, the N-terminal 1–37 residues were invisible (which was not due to degradation; results not shown) and residues 38–46 adopt an unwound loop. Thus this region was proposed to be flexible and exposed to the solvent.
In contrast, oxidized Prx4 exists in a rather stable decameric form, probably stabilized by its unique flexible N-terminal region.
The mutant Prx4-ΔN, lacking the N-terminal 46 residues, was predominantly a decamer in a reduced state, but partially dissociated into dimers especially at lower concentrations after reaction with H2O2, suggesting that the flexible N-terminal region may play a role in stabilization of the Prx4 decamer in the oxidized state.
However, in the full-length Prx4 structure, the N-terminal 1–37 residues were invisible (which was not due to degradation; results not shown) and residues 38–46 adopt an unwound loop. Thus this region was proposed to be flexible and exposed to the solvent.
In contrast, oxidized Prx4 exists in a rather stable decameric form, probably stabilized by its unique flexible N-terminal region.
The second-order rate constant for the reaction of Prx4 with H2O2 was determined to be 2.2 × 107 M−1·s−1 (Figure 6A), indicating that Prx4 can remove H2O2 as efficiently as haem or selenium peroxidases and other Prxs do.
The peroxidase activity was also monitored in a reaction coupled to NADPH oxidation (Figure 6B). NADPH was oxidized with an initial reaction rate of ~1 μM·s−1 in the presence of 2.5 μM Prx4 and 50 μM H2O2, the minimal amount for quantitatively monitoring the reaction in practice. When the H2O2 concentrations increased, the oxidation rate of NADPH decreased, indicating loss of peroxidase activity of Prx4.
Overoxidation of wild-type Prx4 intensified with increasing H2O2 concentrations, whereas the overoxidation of Prx4-ΔC and Prx4-T118E remained negligible, with a faint increase only at 500 μM H2O2.
Prx4 (peroxiredoxin 4) is the only peroxiredoxin located in the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) and a proposed scavenger for H2O2. In the present study, we solved crystal structures of human Prx4 in three different redox forms and characterized the reaction features of Prx4 with H2O2.
Upon completion of the crystallographic refinement, the final R‐factor was 0.163 (R‐free = 0.195), with residues 52–60, 163–179, and 305–315 missing in the final model as no reliable electron density could be detected for these regions.

The hα‐DG‐Nt and mα‐DG‐Nt crystal structures display the most significant structural differences in the flexible linker (see Fig. S2A,B) connecting the Ig‐like and S6 domains.

The Rg distributions of these ensembles (Fig. 7, solid lines) are very similar to each other and nearly as broad as the distribution of randomly generated models (Fig. 7, dashed lines), supporting the hypothesis of a certain degree of interdomain flexibility.

Invariably in all our structures, electron density for helix 13 was absent, indicating unfolding and/or very high flexibility of this region, as already observed by Szilágyi et al. (25). The propensity to unfold might have been reinforced by crystal contacts pushing onto residues 386–387, immediately upstream of helix 13.
The variant used for crystallization lacked the mitochondrial targeting sequence (residues 1–57, (Vogtle et al., 2009)), and the first 13 residues of the mature N-terminus were disordered in the final refined structure.
NT (near the mature N-terminus, residues 83–113) was only ordered in subunit B. NTB includes part of helix α1, an extended loop, strand β1, and the loop leading to β2.

PLP binding is coupled to disorder-order transitions in three distinct regions of ALAS
GR, which overlaps with a conserved glycine-rich motif (Gong and Ferreira, 1995), by contrast, was ordered only in the A subunit and consists of residues 147–156. The ordered GRA element packs against the PLP cofactor-binding pocket that was in the B subunit.

CT is comprised of residues 538–548, the last 11 residues of the eukaryote-specific C-terminal extension in ALASSc. The ordered CTA element from the PLP-free subunit also contributed to the assembled active site of the opposite B subunit.

The activation loop of the kinase (residues 200-215) enclosed between the highly conserved DFG and APE motifs (Fig. 1B) is disordered in the current structure"..."The current structure of Snf1-KD is in the unphosphorylated form. It has been reported that mutating the Thr residue in the activation loop to an Asp residue can confer partial activity to AMPK [18,19]. We have therefore produced crystals of the T210D mutant of yeast Snf1-KD and determined its structure at 2.7 A˚ resolution. This structure showed that the activation loop is still disordered in the T210D mutant

This structure corresponds to an unphosphorylated state and also the T210D phspophomimetic mutant
Snf1-pKD displays a ‘closed’ conformation, although the phosphorylated Thr 210 is invisible,

This structure corresponds to an active form that is phosphorylated on the activation loop residue T210 (this is part of the disordered region)
A new inhibited conformation of the KD is observed in a DFG-out conformation and with the glycine-rich loop adopting a structure that blocks ATP binding to the active site.
A large part of the activation segment of the KD, including Thr210 that is phosphorylated for activation, is ordered in the new structure. These residues are positioned far from the rest of the KD (Fig. 1  c). 
This region corresponds to the activation loop that contains T210. This structure reports an unphosphorylated and inactive form of the enzyme. Phosphorylation at T210 leads to disorder in a larger region of the activation loop (197-212) and when the domain is in the unphosphorylated inhibited conformation, structuring is observed and only residues 199-205 remain disordered. 
The strand connections, denoted as loops I, II and III, range from residues Ile25-Leu38, Cys53-Val58 and Val78 -Lys81, respectively, are exposed to solvent and show partial disorder in all three independent monomers
Because processing removes residues 1-81 from the mature protein form, the L1 loop residue numbering and boundaries are as follows: residue Ile25 named by the authors corresponds to Ile 106 in the UNIPROT entry, and Leu 38 named by the authors corresponds to Leu 119.
A large-scale structural organization and rearrangement is observed for PDGF-B upon receptor binding, in which the PDGF-B L1 loop, disordered in the structure of the free form, adopts a highly specific conformation to form hydrophobic interactions with the third Ig domain of PDGFRbeta
The loop itself is exquisitely configured in the complex, with the aromatic ring of Phe37 at the center of the hydrophobic core, and numerous intraloop hydrogen bonds to maintain main chain peptide conformation (Fig. 3C). Therefore, this loop has an intrinsic propensity to fold into the observed conformation. In support of this notion, the L1 loop of the propeptide-bound PDGF-A, which is only marginally stabilized at its base by the interaction with the propeptide, is ordered and adopts a similar conformation to PDGF-B (Fig. S3D). Hence, the free PDGF-B L1 loop, which was disordered in that structure, may exist in equilibrium between folded and unfolded states, the former only selected by receptor binding.
Figure 4 Legend: Comparison between the free PDGF-B (PDB code 1PDG) dimer (red) and the PDGFRβ-bound PDGF-B dimer (cyan for the protruding protomer and green for the receding protomer) shows that PDGFRβ-binding induces the structural organization of the previously disordered large L1 loop

The atomic model comprises residues 27-1147, with internal breaks corresponding to flexible regions (including part of the RBM), and lacks the C-terminal most segment (including the heptad repeat 2) that is not visible in the map, as is the case for all S structures determined to date.

Our final model spans S residues 27 to 1146, with several flexible loops omitted.

Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of full-length human ACE2 in the presence of the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 with or without the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2, both at an overall resolution of 2.9 angstroms, with a local resolution of 3.5 angstroms at the ACE2-RBD interface.

Despite a high similarity with the genome sequence of SARS-CoV and SARS-like CoVs, we identified a peculiar furin-like cleavage site in the Spike protein of the 2019-nCoV, lacking in the other SARS-like CoVs.
In this article, we focus on a specific furin-like protease recognition pattern present in the vicinity of one of the maturation sites of the S protein (Fig. 1B) that may have significant functional implications for virus entry.
For instance, the pathogenesis of some CoV has been previously related to the presence of a furin-like cleavage site in the S-protein sequence. For example, the insertion of a similar cleavage site in the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) S-protein results in higher pathogenicity, pronounced neural symptoms and neurotropism in infected chickens (Cheng et al., 2019).
Similarly, in the case of influenza virus, low-pathogenicity forms of influenza virus contain a single basic residue at the cleavage site, which is cleaved by trypsin-like proteases and the tissue distribution of the activating protease(s) typically restricts infections to the respiratory and/or intestinal organs (Sun et al., 2010). Conversely, the highly pathogenic forms of influenza have a furin-like cleavage site cleaved by different cellular proteases, including furin, which are expressed in a wide variety of cell types allowing a widening of the cell tropism of the virus (Kido et al., 2012).
This furin-like cleavage site, is supposed to be cleaved during virus egress (Mille and Whittaker, 2014) for S-protein “priming” and may provide a gain-of-function to the 2019-nCoV for efficient spreading in the human population compared to other lineage b betacoronaviruses.
Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases.
Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming.
The present study provides evidence that host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 depends on the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 and can be blocked by a clinically proven inhibitor of the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2, which is employed by SARS-CoV-2 for S protein priming.
These results suggest efficient proteolytic processing of SARS-2-S in human cells, in keeping with the presence of several arginine residues at the S1/S2 cleavage site of SARS-2-S but not SARS-S.

Moreover, antiserum raised against human ACE2 blocked SARS-S- and SARS-2-S- but not VSV-G- or MERS-S-driven entry (Figure 3B). Finally, authentic SARS-CoV-2 infected BHK-21 cells transfected to express ACE2 cells but not parental BHK-21 cells with high efficiency (Figure 3C), indicating that SARS-2-S, like SARS-S, uses ACE2 for cellular entry.

To determine the site-specific glycosylation of SARS-CoV-2 S, we employed trypsin, chymotrypsin, and alphalytic protease to generate three glycopeptide samples. These proteases were selected to generate glycopeptides that contain a single N-linked glycan sequon. The glycopeptides were analyzed by liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and the glycan compositions were determined for all 22 N-linked glycan sites (Fig. 2). Although unoccupied glycosylation sites were detected on SARS-CoV-2 S, when quantified they were revealed to form a very minor component of the total peptide pool (table S2).

We characterized the N-linked glycans on extended flexible loop structures (N74 and N149) and at the membrane-proximal C terminus (N1158, N1173, N1194) that were not resolved in the cryo-EM maps (4) These were determined to be complex-type glycans, consistent with steric accessibility of these residues.

The region corresponds to the so called RBM or Receptor Binding Motif, a region that is a flexible and disordered loop in the unbound state, and becomes ordered in all the available ACE2-bound SARS-CoV-2 Spike structures. Flexibility in the unbound state can be observed in PDB:6VSB [PMID: 32075877] and PDB:6VYB [PMID: 32155444] and the ordering that occurs in the ACE-2 bound form can be seen in PDB: 6M17 [PMID: 32132184] and PDB: 6MOJ [PMID: 32225176]
Surprisingly, the hDicer-specific-segment, that forms the ‘hDicer-specific helix’ in the structure of hDicer PAZ cassette-siRNA 12-mer complex (Figure 1D) is melted/disordered (spanning residues 1005-1019) in the hDicer PAZ cassette-siRNA 16-mer complex (Figure 6B, dotted red line).
Due to a shift in the numbering used by the authors, the missing residues correspond to UNIPROT numbering 1003-1029
The authors mention only the disordering of the specific helix (1015-1029), but in the structure the preceding loop (1003-1014) is also disordered, so in this structure both the loop and helix are disordered. This is the 16-mer siRNA bound enzyme and represents the cleavage competent state
We propose that our structure of the hDicer PAZ cassette-siRNA 16-mer complex (Figure 6B), where the Dicer-specific segment is disordered/melted, likely reflects the cleavage-competent conformation.
One of the unexpected features of the structure of the hDicer PAZ cassette-siRNA 12-mer complex is the identification of a disordered segment (993-1003), followed by an α-helical segment (1006-1020), with the latter designated the ‘hDicer-specific helix’. This helix extends out from the surface of the protein in a knob-like manner (Figure 1D, E), and in turn orients the bound siRNA duplex at an angle (approximately 60°) away from the surface of the protein
We postulate that the knob-like orientation of the hDicer-specific helix in hDicer PAZ cassette-siRNA 12-mer complex, wherein the bound siRNA is aligned at approximately 60° to the flat surface of the hDicer PAZ cassette, may represent the conformation associated with product release/transfer (Figure 7B)
The numbering used by authors is shifted by 10. The disordered segment (993-1003 by the authors) corresponds to residues 1003-1013 in the UNIPROT numbering. In this structure of hDICER with a 12-mer siRNA, the loop preceding the terminal helix (1003-1013) is disordered. This is the 12-mer siRNA bound enzyme and represents the product/release state

The numbering used by authors is shifted by 10. In the hDICER bound to the 12-mer siRNA, the disordered segment (993-1003 by the authors) corresponds to residues 1003-1013 in the UNIPROT numbering. In the hDICER structure bound to 16-mer siRNA, the disordered segment extends to include the terminal helix (residues 1003-1029) and therefore residues 1014-1029 corresponding to the terminal helix become ordered.
We postulate that the knob-like orientation of the hDicer-specific helix in hDicer PAZ cassette-siRNA 12-mer complex, wherein the bound siRNA is aligned at approximately 60° to the flat surface of the hDicer PAZ cassette, may represent the conformation associated with product release/transfer (Figure 7B), while the disruption of the hDicer-specific helix identified in the hDicer PAZ cassette-siRNA 16-mer complex, wherein the bound siRNA siRNA is aligned at an angle of approximately 30° with the flat surface of the hDicer PAZ cassette, most likely represents the conformation associated with the cleavage-competent step (Figure 7A)
The region encompassing residues 1003-1029 is postulated to participate in defining different states of the hDICER RNA processing cycle, from cleavage-competent (loop and helix disordered, 16-mer siRNA 4NHA) to product/release (only loop disordered, hDICER bound to 12-mer siRNA 4NGD)
The capping helix α1 is linked to the first hairpin (HP1: helices α2 and α3) through an 11-residue loop that is disordered in the crystals. Hairpins HP1 and HP2 are connected by a highly charged, 23-residue loop L2 (residues 211-234) that is also disordered in the crystals.
The C-terminal domain, CTD, spans residues 156-357 of of FANCF

Moreover, the αβE region consisting of an α-helix and a β-strand of the coenzyme domain at the dimer interface are disordered, likely due to the loss of interactions with the inter-domain linker, which leads to incomplete β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) binding pocket.
Although the enzyme was co-crystallized with the β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) coenzyme, all structures, which are very similar, are devoid of NAD+ and display the same disordered region forming the coenzyme binding site.
The αβE region is not visible in the electron density maps thus is highly mobile (Figure 3C,D). The αE helix delineates the coenzyme cavity and possesses conserved residues known to bind the pyrophosphate moiety such as Ser233 and Thr236 (Ser242 and Thr245 in GmALDH9A2). 
This region interacts with the bound NAD+ when present in ALDH structures, and the absence of a bound NAD+ in the HsALDH9A1 structure is in agreement with this largely disordered region.

The final models of npFus3, Fus3VF, Fus3/Ste7_pep1, Fus3/Msg5_pep, and Fus3/Far1_pep contain a full-length model of Fus3 (1–353) interspersed with a flexible segment encompassing part of the activation loop (164–179). This region appears to be flexible and invisible in all the structures.
Residues 531–544 were not visible in the electron density maps of the four β-Gal monomers in asymmetric units; therefore, these residues were not modeled.
The crystal structure showed that Arg-530 and Asn545 are separated by about 40 Å, and they point in opposite directions. Therefore, it seems that these residues were connected by a flexible loop before trypsinization.

Although the overall alterations between the catalytic domains of the apoenzyme and 2-OG complex are relatively modest (root mean square deviation value of 1.25 Å for all aligned atoms), pronounced structural changes occur in the linker between β4 and α4 that is disordered in the apoenzyme. Binding of 2-OG induces ordering of the linker, resulting in the formation of the 3104 helix and the β4.1-β4.2 hairpin. RES

In the structures of the HCS apoenzyme and one of the 2-OG binary complexes, a lid motif from the C-terminal domain occludes the entrance to the active site of the neighboring monomer, whereas in the second 2-OG complex the lid is disordered, suggesting that it regulates substrate access to the active site through its apparent flexibility.
In the course of screening crystals of the SpHCS·2-OG complex, we identified two different conformations of the lid motif (residues 320–333) that encloses the entrance to the active site, which we term the closed and open conformations. In the closed lid complex (2.67 Å resolution), the lid motif is clearly visible in the electron density map and obstructs the entrance to the active site, whereas in the open complex (2.72 Å resolution), density for the lid is absent, resulting in a solvent-exposed active site.

The N and C termini of the FkpA polypeptide chain have peptide segments of 14 (in all three structures) and 18 residues (in full-length FkpA), respectively, which could not be identified in the electron density maps of the crystal structures.

The C-terminal ≈20 residues of HBP23 corresponding to the N-terminal half of this ORF6 subdomain are disordered in the crystal as described.
The current structure of HBP23 consists of 173 residues (3–175); the N-terminal 2 and the C-terminal 24 residues (176–199) are not included in the model because of their weak electron densities.
Several regions of the polypeptide chain, including residues Met1–Val6, Asp37–Glu51, and Asp221–Thr238, were not visible in the electron density map and assumed being disordered in the crystal.
All three above-mentioned disordered regions in the PAICS crystal structure are located in the SAICARs domain.

However, residues 110-132 in molecule A and residues 92-94 and 118-134 in molecule B can not be fit to the electron density due to disorder. SipD is a highly α-helical protein, with 62% of residues in 8 α-helices (α1-α8), 6% residues in 5 short beta strands (β1-β5), and the rest in loops and disordered regions.
A 9-residue deletion (Δ116-124) in the 23-residue loop (spanning residues 110-134) did not affect bacterial invasiveness, thus the long loop between helix α3 and α4, which had no electron density in the crystal structure, was not important in the function of SipD.

These structural analyses suggest that the linker region between the N-finger and the C-finger in GATA3 does not appear to have any conformational limitations. One of its functional roles appears to be providing a constraint on the spacing of the palindromic sites and the geometric distance between the DNA molecules bridged by GATA, while the flexibility of the linker region allows a wide variety of orientations of the bridged DNA molecules.

All DNA bases and amino acid residues 2–103 were defined in electron density, but electron density for amino acid residues 1 and 104–135, and the C-terminal His-tag is missing.
The structure reveals two helix–turn–helix (HTH) protein domains separated by a linker of 18 amino acids, binding to the 26mer duplex of DNA, as shown in Figure ​Figure2.2. All DNA bases and amino acid residues 2–103 were defined in electron density, but electron density for amino acid residues 1 and 104–135, and the C-terminal His-tag is missing. It is probable that the N-terminal methionine was removed from the protein, as shown for the earlier construct (17). The C-terminal residues are not visible in the electron density, probably due to the flexibility of these amino acids in the absence of the catalytic domain.
The limited resolution, the high B-factor of the data and the missing C-terminal amino acids result in a relatively high R-factor (23.3%) and free R-factor (27.3%).

The structure reveals two helix–turn–helix (HTH) protein domains separated by a linker of 18 amino acids, binding to the 26mer duplex of DNA, as shown in Figure ​Figure2.2.

Residues 1–38 and 68–170, and 1–41 and 67–170 were modeled for chains A and B, respectively; similar to other crystal structures of HRF (Vedadi et al., 2007, Susini et al., 2008, Dong et al., 2009, Eichhorn et al., 2013), the mobile loop region (residues Thr39-Val66) was disordered.
HRF crystal and solution structures have provided little insight into either the formation of disulphide-linked HRF dimers or the ability of HRF to activate mast cells.
The current model for the activity of HRF in mast cell activation involves cross-linking of FcεRI-bound IgE by dimeric HRF, mediated by interactions between HRF and the Fab regions of IgE
The N‐terminal 25 residues can not be located in the electron density maps, indicating disorder in the N‐terminal part of TN.
The disordered segment at the N-terminal region of the protein correspond to residues 22-46, since region 1-21 is the signal peptide
The close structural resemblance of TN to the neck and CRD part of the MBPs, where carbohydrate‐binding is conferred to the CRD, whereas other additional domains provide the diversity of functions of these proteins, indicate that the kringle 4‐binding site resides within residues 1–49 of the TN sequence. This is supported by the observation that only the full‐length protein and not the isolated CRD binds to immobilized kringle 4 (Holtet, T.L., unpublished). 
However, the observations that TN binds to the kringle 4 domain of plasminogen [1, 10], interacts in a calcium‐dependent manner with sulfated polysaccharides [11] and fibrin [12], binds to immobilized fucoidan (Graversen, J.H., unpublished), as well as the presence of two characteristic calcium sites in the TN structure, suggest that one function of the protein is to target plasminogen to specific carbohydrate ligands on cell surfaces, in the extracellular matrix or to fibrin.

Except for 12 flexible N-terminal residues (Met1-Ala12), all other amino acids are defined in the electron density map.
Our structural analysis suggests that the flexibility of the N-terminal domain together with the described positively charged surface (Fig. 4) may be important for the biological functions of mTnfaip8 and hTIPE3 probably assisting in the uptake and release of phosphoglycerides.

The tail domain of hmtCCase (residues 355–405) as well as a stretch of 11 amino acid residues (99–110) within the head domain are completely disordered in the structure.
This IDR corresponds to the stretch of 11 amino acid residues, whose numbering in the publication is referred to the multiple sequence alignment of Figure 1.

Based on our results, we introduce a corkscrew model for CCA addition that includes a fixed active site and a traveling tRNA-binding region formed by flexible parts of the protein.
The region disordered in both CCase-structures should provide the enzymes with the necessary flexibility to remain bound to tRNA and at the same time to position the tRNA according to the NTP that needs to be incorporated.
Following C-addition, the tRNA remains bound to the flexible loop region of CCase but translocates and rotates relative to the active site to enable binding and addition of the next C-residue.
Major obstacles during structure determination were the limited resolution of the crystals and a high degree of intrinsic disorder in the protein (almost 16% of the CCA-adding enzyme is not traceable in the electron density). Similar conformational flexibility has been observed in several protein structures and often appears to be a prerequisite for enzymatic function.24 The presence of disordered regions within the crystals should also be the reason for the rather high Rfree value of 31.8%, especially as the final 2Fo−Fc and omit electron density maps show unambiguous electron density and confirm that the refined model is correct.
In RhoE, electron density is well defined for residues Gln20 to Lys200, whereas in ROCK-I residues 6–404 are similarly well resolved.
ROCK-I phosphorylates the unconventional G-protein RhoE on multiple N- and C-terminal sites. These phosphorylation events stabilise RhoE, which functions to antagonise RhoA-induced stress fibre assembly.
Importantly, Ser7 and Ser11 of RhoE are sites of ROCK-I phosphorylation (Riento et al, 2005a).
Within the context of the crystal structure, the two ROCK-I phosphorylation sites present in RhoE (Ser7 and Ser11) are likely interchanging at the catalytic (primary binding) site, with resultant low substrate occupancy and consequently disordered and poorly resolved electron density.
The interaction of RhoE with ROCK-I positions RhoE to present both its N and C termini in close proximity to the kinase catalytic site cleft (Figure 5A). The visible N and C termini of RhoE (residues 20 and 200, respectively) are located some 20 Å from the kinase phosphoacceptor-binding site.
Model building studies, extending the polypeptide chain N-terminal from Gln20, and with reference to the position of the GSK3β peptide bound to PKBβ (Yang et al, 2002), indicate that both N-terminal phosphorylation sites, Ser7 and Ser11, are within reach of the catalytic site (Figure 5A).

Cleavage of the purified al protein with chymotrypsin generates two major fragments...This analysis showed that the larger fragment consists of amino acids 1-102 and the smaller fragment consists of amino acids 132-210 of al (210 residues total).
The limited proteolysis experiments identify residues 103-131 as the flexible linker
The otherwise flexible amino-terminal extension of the MATalpha2 homeodomain forms a beta-hairpin that grips the MCM1 surface through parallel beta-strand hydrogen bonds and close-packed, predominantly hydrophobic, side chains.....An unusual feature of the complex is that an eight-amino-acid sequence adopts an alpha-helical conformation in one of two copies of the MATalpha2 monomer and a beta-strand conformation in the other. This 'chameleon' sequence of MATalpha2 may be important for recognizing natural operator sites.
The structure shows that α2 uses a short eight-amino-acid module in the linker region to bind MCM1 via parallel β-strands. This recognition strand is tethered to the α2 homeodomain by a segment of unusual conformational flexibility. 
The cis copy of the α2 flexible linker implicated in the interaction with MCM1 (refs 23,26) forms a β-hairpin with a type-I turn.
The results compared to the flexible region identified by proteolysis, indicate that residues 113-132 become ordered upon binding MCM1 and DNA. This structure consists of a beta strand (113-120) involved in MCM1 binding, plus a "chameleon" region (121-128) that can be either a beta strand or a helix
The α2 residues 121–128, QDMINKST, have the unusual property of forming either an α-helix or a β-strand. 
The α2 residues 121–128, QDMINKST, have the unusual property of forming either an α-helix or a β-strand. 
This paper demonstrates the two domains are joined by a flexible linker
An a2 fragment beginning with residue 120 retains partial cooperative binding with MCMl , and a fragment that starts with residue 128 fails to show strong cooperative binding with MCMl. These results suggest that approximately 20 residues (110-l 28) adjacent to the homeodomain are required for cooperative binding with MCMl. 
This paper demonstrates the linker region is required for cooperative MCM1 binding

The otherwise flexible amino-terminal extension of the MATalpha2 homeodomain forms a beta-hairpin that grips the MCM1 surface through parallel beta-strand hydrogen bonds and close-packed, predominantly hydrophobic, side chains
With the exception of Val 119, each of the α2 residues between Leu 114 and Gln 121 (LVFNVVTQ) makes van der Waals contacts with MCM1 residues. 
The a2 fragment used in our crystallographic study extends to the C-terminal end of a2 and therefore contains an additional 22 residues following the C-terminus of the homeodomain. This C-terminal tail may mediate the interaction between a2 and al (A. Mak and A. D. J., unpublished data; see also Strathern et al., 1988). We do not see clear electron density for this region and presume that it is disordered in the crystal. 
The region actually corresponds to 21 residues 190-210 as shown by the crystal structure
We found that the a1 homeodomain perturbs the resonances of only the C-terminal tail of a2; moreover, contact with a1 converts a portion of this tail (residues 193-203) from its unstructured state to an a-helix, as determined by J coupling and NOE measurements
These NOE cross peak volume data suggest that residues 194-200 are helical.

Binding to MAT alpha 1 structures the C terminal tail into a helix as shown by NMR
The a1 and a2 homeodomains bind in a head-to-tail orientation, with heterodimer contacts mediated by a 16-residue tail located carboxyl-terminal to the a2 homeodomain. This tail becomes ordered in the presence of al, part of it forming a short amphipathic helix that packs against the a1 horneodomain between helices 1 and 2
The a2 protein contacts the a1 homeodomain with a peptide tail located COOHterminal to the a2 homeodomain. As compared with the structure of a2 alone bound to DNA, an additional 16 residues are ordered in the ternary complex. This COOHterminal tail, consisting of residues 59 to 74
Numbering is shifted by 131 residues according to UNIPROT accession, and the region corresponds to residues 190-205 of the UNIPROT sequence

The missing residues in the crystal structure correspond to residues 179-191
NMR: The average intensity of the C-terminal resonances was 4 times higher than those of the central RRM domain (P < 0.0001). Therefore, our NMR results indicate that the C-terminal region tumbles as a flexible moiety at a rate faster than the core RRM domain (Figure (Figure4D4D).
The flexible residues from NMR analysis correspond to residues 181-220
Small-angle X-ray scattering, NMR and RNA-binding analyses further reveal that the C-terminal residues of Nop15 are highly flexible
SAXS: we used SAXS to study Nop1581–220 (Figure (Figure4A,4A, Supplementary Table S3). We evaluated the SAXS data using the EOM, which allows fitting of an ensemble of structures for flexible protein regions. The selected set of three conformers that optimally fit the SAXS data indicated that the C-terminal residues (181–220) are highly flexible, widely sampling around the core RRM domain (Figure (Figure4A4A and B).
The flexible residues from SAXS analysis correspond to residues 181-220
Small-angle X-ray scattering, NMR and RNA-binding analyses further reveal that the C-terminal residues of Nop15 are highly flexible
Small-angle X-ray scattering, NMR and RNA-binding analyses further reveal that the C-terminal residues of Nop15 are highly flexible, but essential for tight RNA binding. Moreover, comparison with a recently reported cryo-electron microscopy structure indicates that dramatic rearrangement of the C-terminal region of Nop15 in the pre-ribosome exposes the RNA-binding surface to recognize the base of its stem-loop target RNA
Comparing our crystal structure with Nop15 in a cryo-EM model of the pre-60S ribosome (17) indicates that the α-helical region is dramatically refolded, which releases the classical RNA-binding residues for interaction at the base of an ITS2 stem-loop and allows interaction of the C-terminal residues near the distal loop of the stem-loop.
The disorder to order transition is deduced from the comparison of the results of this paper with those of CryoEM structures where the same region is folded

However, states A–C already contain a hallmark structure typically seen on Arx1 or Nog2 particles, termed the “foot,” which is formed by ITS2 rRNA and its associated “A3” cluster factors Cic1/Nsa3, Nop7, Nop15, and Rlp7

There is no statement in the paper but residues 1-87 are disordered

Our binding assays indicate that the residues of Nop15 C-terminal to the α3/α4 helices (181–220) are important for RNA binding
Moreover, removal of an additional 12 residues from the C-terminus (Nop1581–180) further weakened RNA-binding affinity to 30-fold weaker than Nop15 81–220. Together these results indicate that the C-terminal residues are paradoxically important for RNA recognition, despite sequestering the classical RNA-binding residues.

Deletion of the N-terminal region that was not included in our crystal structure (residues 1–80) increased RNA-binding affinity 8 fold (Kd = 35.4 nM for Nop1581–220) (Figure ​(Figure2C2C and D, Table ​Table1).1).
The best results were obtained for variant Jac1-C2 (residues 5–182). Similar to Jac1-C1, Jac1-C2 crystallized with two molecules (A and B) in the asymmetric unit and diffracted X-rays to 1.85 Å resolution. The structure was determined for residues 8–181 (A) and 12–176 (B), but segments consisting of residues 47–60 and 95–98 (B) were not resolved.
The structure of Jac1 is L-shaped and consists of 2 distinct α-helical domains (Fig. 1); the N-terminal J-domain (residues 11–84) and the C-terminal Isu binding C-domain (residues 101–184). These two domains are connected by a flexible linker (residues 85–100). 
Interestingly, the linker helix is ordered in molecule A of both Jac1 structures and disordered in molecule B, suggesting intrinsic flexibility of this region.

The final crystallographic model consisted of 140 protein residues (corresponding to residues 12–164 of the mGal sequence deposited in GenBank as AAC27245.1), one lactose molecule, two glycerol molecules, part of a polyethylene glycol molecule (comprising two ethylene glycol units), one sodium cation and 189 water molecules.
Residues 1 and 2, 106-116, and 136-138 were disordered. 91.8% of total residues were in the most favored regions, and 0% were in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot.
The AB (residues 106-116) and CC′ (residues 136-138) loops of D2 were disordered (Fig. 1, A and C).
However, residues 106-116 of D2, which corresponds to the A′ strand of D1 in the other LRC receptors, was disordered.
Disordered residue 106-116 of the crystal structure corresponds to sequence residues 147-157
The average B-factor of D2 (46.0 Å2) was higher than that of domain 1 (D1) (24.3 Å2), which may be due to the relatively loose packing of D2 in the crystal.
Disordered residue 106-116 of the crystal structure corresponds to sequence residues 147-157
Thus, this loop is more flexible than the equivalent region in the other LRC receptors. Since the predicted N-linked glycosylation site (Asn116) was located on the disordered AB loop in D2, the attached sugar moiety might be expected to be very mobile
Disordered residue 106-116 of the crystal structure corresponds to sequence residues 147-157, therefore the glycosylated residue is Asn157
The crystal structure of Δ13Arf6-GDP reveals an unprecedented unfolding of the GTPase core β-strands, which is fully accounted for by small-angle X-ray scattering data in solution and by ab initio three-dimensional envelope calculation.

Residues affected by structural changes extend from Lys34 in strand β1′, which corresponds to switch 1 in Arf-GDP structures, to Asn56 after strand β2 (interswitch) in the central β-sheet. The β1′–β2 region is essentially disordered in one Δ13Arf6-GDP subunit of the asymmetric unit, while in the other subunit, β1′–β2

NMR: NMR chemical shifts provide a powerful means of detecting local disorder in proteins…It features a significant number of peaks that are too broad to be resolved individually, and a paucity of peaks in the ranges 8.5–10 ppm (1 H) and 123– 133 ppm (15N), which generally correspond to βsheet structures….fully consistent with the unfolding of β-strands and with the enrichment in flexible structures, as seen in the Δ13Arf6-GDP crystal

SAXS: The SAXS envelope of Arf6- GDPFL was essentially globular and superimposed very well with the crystal structure of Arf6-GDPFL (Fig. 3c). In contrast, the Δ13Arf6-GDP SAXS envelope displayed a large protrusion (Fig. 3d). Remarkably, the protrusion readily accommodated the partially unfolded β1′–β2 strands from the Δ13Arf6-GDP crystal structure (Fig. 3d), suggesting that a similar unfolding takes place in solution

NMR chemical shifts identify this structural disorder in Δ13Arf6-GDP [...] Taken together, these experiments suggest an unfolding model for the nucleotide switch of Arf6 and shed new light on its biochemical differences with Arf1.
The structure of Δ13Arf6-GDP in the crystal and in solution was analyzed by the combination of structural and biophysical methods, revealing a partial unfolding of the switch 1 and interswitch regions unique to this small GTPase. 

Altogether, this is one of the largest conformational departures from the classical fold of a small GTPase [...] the 1 H–15N HSQC spectrum of Δ13Arf6-GTP is very well defined and is representative of a well-ordered conformation (Fig. 2, blue). This indicates that the local disorder in Δ13Arf6- GDP is not an intrinsic property of Δ13Arf6, but is specific for its GDP-bound form


Altogether, our results suggest that the GDP/GTP structural switch of Arf6 may follow a structural route different from that of Arf1. The interswitch toggle of Arf6 may proceed through a local unfolding of the interswitch, possibly via a GEFbound intermediate in which Arf6 resembles the Δ13Arf6-GDP structure (Fig. 5d)
The conformational switch is proposed to participate in the nucleotide exchange (GTP/GDP) function of Arf6
The 17 C-terminal residues that are unique to MAP-1 are disordered in the crystal. 
When Bcl-xl F105A (form II) and Bcl-xl F105A (form I) were superposed for 142 Ca (except for Ser28 to Ile81), the overlay, with an RMSD of 0.43 Å, suggested that they were very similar overall


During the course of determining the three-dimensional structure of Bcl-xl, a large region of Bcl-xl was found to be unstructured in the wild type and Y101A and F105A mutant forms, as determined by previous NMR and X-ray crystallographic techniques [3–6,9]. 
This and previous structures show that the region 28-81 is disordered with missing electron density
The rate of nonenzymatic deamidation of two asparagines in the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL is accelerated by this increase in pH. Deamidation of these asparagines is a signal for the degradation of Bcl-xL, which is a component of the apoptotic response to DNA damage […]we present evidence that deamidation of human Bcl-xL is intramolecularly catalyzed in a manner that is dependent upon these histidines. Further, we present evidence that these histidines act as a pH-sensitive switch that enhances the effect of the increase in pH on the rate of Bcl-xL deamidation
We have previously demonstrated that the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bcl-xL undergoes deamidation at Asn 52 and Asn 66 when susceptible tumor cells are treated with DNAdamaging antineoplastic agents [...] We now report that human Bcl-xL contains histidines in close proximity to each of its two deamidation sites and that such histidines are conserved throughout the Bcl-xL p
Indeed, we show here that deamidation of human Bcl-xL is intramolecularly catalyzed in a manner that involves these highly conserved histidines and that treatment of susceptible tumor cells with DNA-damaging agents increases the catalytic activity.

Additionally, we consistently found that total Bcl-xL(H58A/H71A) is markedly increased relative to total wild-type Bcl-xL in cisplatin-treated cells (Fig. 5A). Finally, we found that Bcl-xL(H58A/H71A) is deamidated at a slower rate than wild-type Bcl-xL in cells treated with cycloheximide (Fig. 5B)
All residues that are deamidated (N52 and N66) as well as the catalytic histidines (H58 and H71) are within the IDP region
Residues 1–26 are disordered at the N termini, which both point in the direction of the distal ends of the crescent-shaped dimer.
Residues 67–86 (in the second protomer, residues 70–84) are disordered in the structure and they could extend either sideward or perpendicularly to the concave surface.
Here, we present the 2.3 A crystal structure of the endophilin-A1 BAR domain, which has been suggested to function in inducing and sensing membrane curvature at the site of endocytosis.
The endophilin-1A BAR domain thus constitutes a new variant of a BAR domain, and it may link endophilin-1A BAR function to calcium regulation of endocytosis.
The model spans residues 8–149, although residues 46–48 and 77–104 are poorly ordered and were not placed in the electron density.
Interaction of S14 and MIG12 in Cultured Cells.
The structure of S14 suggests a mechanism whereby heterodimer formation with MIG12 attenuates the ability of MIG12 to activate ACC.
S14 Knockdown Increases ACC Polymerization and Activity in Vivo.
Increasing S14 levels resulted in reduced ACC polymerization (Fig. 5A) and less MIG12 incorporation into ACC polymers
The density for the compound was clearly distinct, as was in general the backbone density for residues between 13 and 314 (the site of Clostripain cleavage in solution), but the residues that follow were disordered.
Phosphomapping of the isolated protein band (MS Bioworks) demonstrated that several sites were phosphorylated, namely: Thr38, Thr145, Thr164, Ser170, Thr227, Ser280, Thr327, Ser329, Thr332, and Tyr379. Because GLK is a Ser/Thr kinase, we reasoned that the Tyr379 phosphorylation must have been the result of another kinase acting on GLK as a substrate. The phosphorylation at Ser170 is likely due to autophosphorylation.
The disordered region is localized between the kinase domain and the CNH domain
The NMR structure of the recombinant human doppel protein, hDpl(24-152), contains a flexibly disordered "tail" comprising residues 24-51, and a globular domain extending from residues 52 to 149 for which a detailed structure was obtained.
The structure of hDpl(24–152) (Figure 1) contains a well defined globular domain and a flexibly disordered tail of residues 24–50, as is seen readily from the relative intensities of the 15N{1H}-NOEs (Supplementary Material, Figure S2a).
When compared to the remainder of the globular domain, there is a low propensity of medium-range and long-range NOE constraints in this region (Supplementary Material, Figure S2b), but the observation of positive 15N{1H}-NOEs for all amide moieties that were assigned in this region indicates that there is static disorder rather than increased intramolecular mobility.
The final model fits the electron density map very well with good geometry. The model includes 131 residues of CLP (of a total of 142 residues).
N-terminal residues (3–0) are extended straight from β1 while C-terminal residues after Lys 131 cannot be defined by the electron density map.
The flexible C-terminal tail for CLP is 11 residues in length, while those for actophorin and yeast cofilin are 3 and 5, respectively.
LP also has a long flexible C terminus composed of 11 residues: AGGANYDAQTE. The first four residues form a hinge region, while the last seven make a good combination for molecular recognition. This flexible C terminus is sited not far from the region containing α1–β2, α4–β5 and β4–β5 loops. As a consequence, the flexible C terminus of CLP may be used to bind F-actin and/or other proteins.
Its long flexible C-terminal arm may help CLP binding other molecules.
In the CLP–F-actin contact surface, besides the complementary morphology of the two polymers, their flexible C-terminal tails could assist the CLP polymer to bind to F-actin.
The structure of (PPNP-bound) MATα2 has a disordered gating loop, providing direct evidence against the idea that it provides the energy for the opening of the gate.
The two ordered sites contain SAMe, PPNP, Mg2+, and K+, whereas the disordered sites contain only an ethylene glycol molecule as a result of the cryoprotection. The structure of (PPNP-bound) MATα2 has a disordered gating loop, and a comparison of the PPNP-bound, MAT(α2)4(βV2)2, and SAMe+ADO+MET+PPNP structures shows that the gate is open when active site is occupied by PPNP.

It has been suggested that when the active site is occupied, the loop is closed like a gate, but when the active site is empty, the loop becomes invisible in the structure, presumably resulting from an open dynamic gate.
The active site gating loop gains order and closes upon substrate binding.
The structure lacked  substrates  or  products;  therefore,  the  Mat2A  gating  loop (Mat2A residues 109–140), which closes upon substrate binding, was disordered and not observed.

Because most residues of FR are disordered in the crystal, we could not obtain further structural information on FR from the crystal structure.To obtain structural information on FR in solution, we expressed the FR moiety of Atg3 (83–162) in E. coli, purified it,and analyzed it by NMR spectroscopy. Fig. 3A shows the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the FR moiety of Atg3.
Intriguingly, the spectrum of full-length Atg3 was strikingly similar to that of FR, suggesting that most observed signals for full-length Atg3 were derived from the FR moiety. This observation indicates that the mobility of FR is much higher than that of other regions of Atg3 because the residues located at the flexible regions give strong NMR signals because of long T2 relaxation times compared with those located at the rigid regions.
These results suggest that the FR moiety of Atg3 has a random coil structure and is highly mobile in solution, not only in the isolated state but also in intact Atg3. Although residues 129–142 of FR have a helical structure in the crystal (Fig. 1,A and B), they may have a more flexible conformation in solution.
Furthermore,in vitro pull down assays showed that FR of Atg3 mediated the binding of Atg7.
The conformation of residues 129–142, which are modeled as helix C, also seems to be flexible because the average B-factor of these residues is rather high (89.9 and 54.0 Å2 for helix C and all Atg3 residues, respectively). 
Otherwise, several loops in Atg7, Atg3, and Atg10, and the BMOE crosslink not visible in the electron density were not modeled in the structures.

IDR inside the ‘handle region’ (HR) of Atg3.
Here, we show by NMR spectroscopy that Atg3 directly interacts with Atg8 through the WEDL sequence in HR and that the interaction is quite similar to Atg8-Atg19AIM and LC3-p62AIM interactions. Thus, the WEDL sequence of Atg3 is a canonical AIM.
The region includes the canonical LIR motif "WEDL".

As expected, the log(Rh) vs. log(Mw) dependency for Atg3FR was significantly displaced from the linear dependency log(Rh) vs. log(Mw) of standard globular proteins, and its experimental hydrodynamic radius exceeds the calculated hydrodynamic radius of both a native-coil-like IDP and a GdmCl-unfolded globular protein with comparable molecular mass (Table 1). This suggests that Atg3FR adopts a conformation even more disordered than that of the full-length Atg3.
 In comparison, the far-UV CD spectrum of Atg3FR (Fig. 3B) did resemble the spectrum of unordered structures with a negative minimum at approximately 200 nm,38,39 indicating that the secondary structure is missing in Atg3FR.
Atg3FR, which behaved as an extended random-coil-like protein (Fig. 2; Fig. 3), has a predicted molecular mass of 10 kDa, but migrated at the position of a polypeptide twice as large (Fig. 4A; Table 2).

In the absence of RNA, the N-terminus (residues 418–431) and C-terminal β6-β7 loop (residues 665–676) are partially disordered (Fig. 2c,f), while in the presence of meSL1p, a helix α0 forms near the N-terminus, loop residues that connect to α1 become ordered, and the β6-β7 loop adopts an ordered structure with a short helix α7 in the middle.
Based on studies indicating that MePCE binds the proximal end of the 7SK SL1 and adjacent ssRNA in vivo (Fig. 1c), we designed and synthesized an RNA hairpin-ssRNA construct comprising the 5′-end of 7SK SL1 with a UUCG tetraloop and an eight nucleotide ssRNA 3′ overhang (SL1p).

The line-widths of the peaks in the spectrum of intact Sgt1 are smaller than expected for a single domain molecule over 30 kDa, strongly implying that the linkers between the domains are flexible and that any contacts between domains are not long-lived. Hence, the domains probably function in a coordinated but not necessarily cooperative manner.

The final structural model includes residues 231–444 of StARD3 (the coordinates for residues 216–230 were omitted because no electron density was observed), 224 water molecules, three molecules of ethylene glycol, one sulfate ion and one molecule of l-(+)-tartaric acid.

For each copy, well-defined electron density is present for residues 143–1158 of MLE (with the exception of a loop 311–321), as well as for ADP-AlF4, a magnesium ion, and 10 ribonucleotides (Table 1).

Proteolysis of MLEΔC resulted in a stable 120 kDa fragment lacking dsRBD1 but containing dsRBD2 (MLE105-1158, referred to as MLEcore) (Figure S1A).
Following the clear continuing electron density from the N terminus of IS1 (Asp268), eight residues were manually built in molecule B, and seven residues in molecules C and D, but only three residues could be traced in molecule A due to insignificant electron density thereafter. The C-terminal end of IS1 is missing, and electron density is not traceable until partway into PC2 at Pro319 in molecule B, Val320 in molecule C, Gln321 in molecule D, and Glu323 in molecule A. The missing portion of IS1 lies between the 1b and 2b autolysis sites (25, 26).
The limits of the disordered segment vary slightly in each structure, and are determined to be 269-320
Both methods showed only 26- and 13-kDa species present. The former matched in size the ΔNS core up to the 1b IS1 cleavage site in PC2, and the latter matched the remainder of PC2 from the 2b IS1 cleavage site onward. These results from the C129S crystals are in agreement with a previous experiment using the Cys129 protease core (25) over a much shorter time frame. It suggests that IS1 of the C129S crystals was indeed autoproteolyzed during crystallization [...] Although there was no autolysis of C129A, most of IS1 still could not be built due to poor quality or missing electron density.

Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis of the C129A mutant suggested that IS1 is disordered and mobile enough to occupy several locations.
Therefore, the missing IS1 region was built in using the ensemble optimization method (EOM) (33). A large conformational pool (10,000 possibilities) was generated using sequence information and the crystal structure of Ca2+-bound calpain-3 C129S core as a template but with PC1 and PC2 unfixed and, therefore, free to rotate. However, only those conformers that were consistent with the SAXS experimental scattering data were retained. The final ensemble of conformers of the calpain-3 core with the IS1 structural model inserted was in excellent agreement with both sets of experimental scattering data,
IS1, interrupts the protease core and must be cleaved for activation and substrate binding
the first cleavage as an essential step to activation through removal of an internal propeptide that otherwise blocks substrate access to the catalytic cleft (25).
But in addition to the metal ion requirement, it is known that calpain-3 has an additional inhibitory feature, which is IS1 acting as an internal autoinhibitory propeptide to block the enzyme's active site (25). Although in the Ca2+-bound crystal structure, most of IS1 is not visible, what can be seen of IS1 in the active site cleft supports the autoinhibition role. First, the N-terminal segment of IS1 (Met272-Thr273-Tyr274-Gly275) protrudes into the active-site cleft through the S3, S2, S1, and S1′ subsites and makes extensive contacts with residues on either side of the catalytic cleft (Fig. 8). (See detailed description below). Second, residues Val320-Gln321-Tyr322 located just beyond the C terminus of IS1 are part of PC2 that lies on the top of the active site, in which Val320 forms an interaction with residue Glu125 OE2 of PC1 (2.9 Å). Furthermore, an extended hydrophobic patch is formed
This region of IS1 that occupies the active-site cleft is perfectly conserved in the comparison of the IS1 sequences from 22 different mammals, which reinforces its functional importance (Fig. S3)
The flexible region occludes the active site, preventing rearrangements necessary for catalytic activity. It needs to undergo auto proteolysis to allow enzyme activation
Nbs1 cardinal features: fused, extended, FHA-BRCT(1)-BRCT(2) domains flexibly linked to C-terminal Mre11- and ATM-binding motifs. 
To define functional Nbs1 regions, we expressed a series of truncated S. pombe Nbs1 (spNbs1) proteins and mapped structured domains with proteolysis
Trypsin degradation of Nbs1-ΔAT reveals a stable 37kDa folded core (Nbs1-fc, residues 1-329) encompassing the Nbs1 FHA domain and its two BRCT domains (Figures 1A and 1B). N-terminal sequencing of smaller transiently stable trypsin products maps three additional cleavage sites to a divergent sequence linking BRCT2 and the MB motif. Thus, the N-terminal 55% of spNbs1 comprises a composite FHA-BRCT1-BRCT2 folded Nbs1-fc that is linked to the C-terminal Mre11 and ATM binding regions via a protease-sensitive linker peptide.

Nbs1 cardinal features: fused, extended, FHA-BRCT(1)-BRCT(2) domains flexibly linked to C-terminal Mre11- and ATM-binding motifs. 
While spNbs1-fc SAXS closely matches the X-ray structure, the maximum particle dimension (Dmax) for spNbs1-ΔAT is much larger (~175 Å), indicating a very elongated structure (Figures 7A and 7B). Consistent with an unstructured Nbs1 C-terminus, the spNbs1-ΔAT Kratky plot is intermediate between parabolic and asymptotic curves, while spNbs1-fc has a parabolic plot showing spNbs1-fc is folded consistent with proteolysis and crystal structures (Figure 7C).
Although its C-terminus may undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding Mre11 and ATM, we do not see stable domains (>10 kDa) when Nbs1 is trypsin digested while in complex with Mre11 (Figure S9). Thus, C-terminal Mre11 and ATM interacting regions may be peptide interaction motifs, rather than globular domains.

Tethering of Ctp1 to a flexible Nbs1 arm suggests a mechanism for restricting DNA end processing and homologous recombination activities of Sae2/Ctp1/CtIP to the immediate vicinity of DSBs
Nbs1 emerges as an extended, flexible binding nexus coordinating interactions between the Mre11-Rad50 core, the checkpoint kinase ATM/Tel1, and the DNA end-processing factor Ctp1.
Flexible Nbs1 molecular associations may accommodate large-scale MRN complex conformational changes, proposed to regulate ATM activation and dimer-to-monomer transitions
Figure S2 Legend: Shown are the chromatogram and the SDS–PAGE of fractions containing the Mre11–Nbs1 complex and free Nbs1. The elution volumes and sizes of proteins from a gel filtration standard (Bio–Rad) are noted on top of the chromatogram. 
The SDS-PAGE and SEC profiles shown in Figure S2 indicate that the fragment is disordered in isolation. It has an anomalous migration profile in SDS-PAGE and elutes as a peak of large Rh compared to its MW. The structures also show poor density in the complex with Mre11 at residues: 474-483 and 497-531

Two Nbs1 subunits stretch around the outside of the nuclease domains of Mre11, with one subunit additionally bridging and locking the Mre11 dimer via a highly conserved asymmetrical binding motif.
Two Nbs1mir molecules wrap around the outside of the two Mre11 phosphodiesterase domains, each binding in a highly extended conformation via a α–helix–β strand motif (Interaction region 1). However, one of the two Nbs1mir molecules additionally binds across the Mre11 dimer interface, forming a second interaction opposite the nuclease cleft (Interaction region 2) (Fig. 2a,b). Consequently, a highly conserved “NFKxFxK motif” (residues 518–526) from one Nbs1mir bridges both copies of the eukaryote–specific loop insertion in the Mre11 dimer.

While the mechanistic link between Rad50 and DNA binding to Mre11 requires further studies, our data suggest that Mre11 dimer flexibility and its control by Nbs1 could be an important part of MRN function.
To better understand NBS mutations, we analyzed the human Nbs1-fc structure with SAXS and proteolysis. Human Nbs1 (hNbs1) forms a trypsin-stable composite FHA-BRCT1-BRCT2 core (hNbs1-fc, residues 1-334) similar to spNbs1-fc (Figure 2A)
The authors don't define the construct used in their paper, and for this reason the C-terminal limit of the disordered region cannot be determined. The curator has decided to use the information in Supplementary Figure S10 but he authors, where the disordered segment in the human protein extends to residue 630. However, the tested segment is surely shorter as the molecular weight of the construct is ~50KDa and includes 334 ordered residues.
Yet, structure-based sequence alignments show an insertion missing in the spNbs1-fc model corresponds to an α-helix usually found between the third and fourth BRCT domain β-strands (β17 and β18 of BRCT2), that is linked to an hNbs1 Ser278 phosphorylation site loop (human Nbs1 residues 272–295) (Figure S3). To model these missing regions of hNbs1-fc, we generated 100 hNbs1-fc models based on the spNbs1 structure using MODELLER, and evaluated models by fit to the SAXS data. This approach identified 12 models with superior χ2 fits (χ2<1.3, best model χ2=1.25) that all bear extended accessible pSer278 loop conformations (Figures 2B and 2C). Thus, the overall spNbs1-fc fold is maintained in hNbs1-fc, but is decorated with a solvent-accessible phosphorylated loop. 
Legend Figure 2: (C) Superposition of 12 homology hNbs1 models with SAXS scattering χ2 fits better than 1.3. ATM Phosphorylation sites in hNbs1 map to surface accessible loops with observed conformational variability between models. Ser278 phosphorylation could mediate auto-regulatory BRCT peptide binding in cis through an interaction with the phosphoprotein-binding cleft
The flexible region includes pSer278 which is a validated site
Here we show that phosphorylation of NBS1, induced by ionizing radiation, requires catalytically active ATM. Complexes containing ATM and NBS1 exist in vivo in both untreated cells and cells treated with ionizing radiation. We have identified two residues of NBS1, Ser 278 and Ser 343 that are phosphorylated in vitro by ATM and whose modification in vivo is essential for the cellular response to DNA damage.
To determine whether Ser 278 and Ser 343 of NBS1 are phosphorylated in vivo, NBS1-LBI, a T-antigen immortalized NBS cell line established from a patient carrying the common founder mutation 657del5 (ref. 23) in NBS1, was transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type NBS1 (pCMV-NBS1wt); NBS1S278A (pCMV–NBS1S278A), NBS1S343A (pCMV–NBS1S343A) or NBS1S278A/S343A (pCMV–NBS1S278A/S343A)
Upon treatment with ionizing radiation, the mobility of NBS1wt, but not NBS1S278A, NBS1S343A or NBS1S278A/S343A, was altered ( Fig. 3b, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 3 and 4 and 7–10). These data indicate that Ser 278 and Ser 343 are phosphorylated in vivo.
The pSer278 site is phosphorylated by ATM
Binding of the NFKxFxK motif at the Mre11 dimer interface is mediated by the eukaryote–specific insertion loops (one from each Mre11 protomer). As a result, these loops undergo a substantial structural change and a disorder to order transition, leading us to name these as “latching loops”. 
In the free state Mre11, residues 101-116 from the "latching loop" are disordered

The second part, unique to eukaryotic Mre11, comprises the latching loops that interact with each other via an extended loop in the presence (but not absence) of Nbs1. As seen from the structures of Nbs1mir–Mre11cd and apo–Mre11cd, Nbs1 induces a disorder–to–order transition and geometric rearrangement of the latching loops (Fig. 4b–d), flipping them almost 180° towards the basal phosphodiesterase core.
In the free state Mre11 (4FCX), residues 101-116 from the "latching loop" are disordered. In the complex (4FBQ), only residues 103-108 remain disordered

In contrast, our data suggest that telomere maintenance depends on a stable interaction between the NFKxFxK motif of Xrs2/Nbs1 and the latching loops of Mre11 [...] The asymmetric bridging of Mre11 dimers by a single Nbs1 subunit, paired with the uncovered intrinsic flexibility of the eukaryotic Mre11 dimer, is perhaps the most significant and unexpected finding of our structural and functional analyses. 
Pol32C harboring the C-terminus PIP motif is disordered, but the spatial position of Pol32N is such that it would allow for the PIP motif of Pol32C to extend to the downstream portion of the DNA duplex for interactions with PCNA (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 3).
To analyze the roles of PIP motifs individually, we purified Polδ complexes that carry either (1) the F1002A, I1003A mutations in the Pol3 PIP, (2) the Y327A, F328A mutations in the Pol31 PIP, or (3) where the PIP of Pol32 had been inactivated by deleting C-terminal residues 337–350 of the protein (1–336) or by changing the conserved F344, F345 residues to alanines (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3C, Polδ harboring a mutation in the Pol3 PIP (lane 5) or lacking the Pol32 PIP (lane 9) exhibits a reduction in PCNA-stimulated DNA synthesis and the formation of fully extended product was impaired by these mutations, similar to that observed for mutations in the Pol31 PIP (lane 7). Thus PCNA binding motifs in all three subunits affect Polδ’s ability to synthesize DNA with PCNA, and they all appear to affect it to about the same degree.

This is a PCNA interacting PIP Box motif

The observed defects in mutagenesis were less severe with pol32– 10, a C-terminal 7 aa truncation (F344FKRKAK), than with the internal deletion mutant pol32–9 deleting aa 310–343 which include QGTLES343 of the motif, suggesting the existence of residual interactions between Pol32–10 and PCNA in vivo.


Polδ CysAD is disordered, suggestive of a flexible region that may only become ordered when it interacts with other components of the replication fork, including PCNA18 (Supplementary Fig. 3)[...]The paucity of interactions between the catalytic and regulatory modules behooves a relatively flexible complex able to accommodate changes in DNA direction. In a previous low resolution SAXS analysis of the Polδ holoenzyme in the absence of DNA, we observed significant flexibility between the catalytic and regulatory modules35. From the current cryo-EM analysis, flexibility between the modules appears to be a feature even when Polδ is complexed to DNA.

From the structure, the interface between the catalytic and regulatory modules is relatively sparse and suggestive of a relatively flexible complex able to accommodate changes in DNA direction.

Flexibility between the regulatory and catalytic modules, coupled with the proximity of the regulatory module to the exo and thumb domains, appears to be important for the 3′→5′ exonuclease activity of Polδ

Local flexibility between the catalytic and regulatory modules may also facilitate the binding of various DNA substrates in these diverse pathways.


To define the dynamics of the full-length SH3BP5 protein, we used hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS).
We carried out HDX experiments with a short pulse of deuterium exposure (3 s at 1 °C) for the full-length SH3BP5, with both the N terminus and C terminus of SH3BP5 having > 50% deuterium incorporation, indicating limited secondary structure (Supplementary Figure 3a). HDX-MS results were used to generate a crystal construct of SH3BP5, with all of the C-terminal disordered region removed (SH3BP5 1–265).
The first PHD finger adopts a mixed α/β fold characteristic of canonical PHD fingers, while PHD finger 2 is atypical and is composed solely of six α-helical segments with a disordered segment spanning residues 179–188 (Figure S2A).
A segment within PHD finger 2 of AF10PZP, that spans amino acids 179-188, is disordered in the 1.60 Å structure in the free state (Figure S2A). Upon complex formation with H3(1-36) peptide, this region becomes ordered to form an anti-parallel β-sheet (Figure 2I, marked by arrow; free and bound structures superimposition shown in Figure S2D). This dynamic β-sheet forms part of the binding channel wall within the PZP domain and contributes to the alignment of the bound H3 peptide with residue E179, which emanates from this β-sheet platform, directly involved in recognition of the ε-NH3+ group of K23 (Figure 2E).

In cells, PZP recognition of H3 is required for H3K79 dimethylation, expression of DOT1L-target genes, and proliferation of DOT1L-addicted leukemic cells. Together, our results uncover a pivotal role for H3K27-via readout by the AF10 PZP domain-in regulating the cancer-associated enzyme DOT1L.

In this study we present the structure of murine Sclerostin by solution NMR spectroscopy revealing that only the cystin-knot motif is structured.
N- and C-termini of Sclerostin are flexible
We initially prepared full-length murine Sclerostin (mSOST) in Sf9 cells (Fig. 1A). The protein comprising Gln1 to Tyr188 could be obtained from the supernatant of Sf9 cells. Staining via the Periodic Schiff Acid method confirmed the presence of glycosylation; mass spectrometry subsequently showed both N-glycosylation sites, Asn28 and Asn150, to be linked to carbohydrates. Storage of full-length mSOST over several weeks at 4 °C resulted in partial proteolysis although the protein solution had a purity of ⩾95%. Thus residual protease activity cleaves mSOST indicating the presence of flexible regions. The largest fragment showed an apparent molecular weight of roughly 10–12 kDa in a SDS–PAGE analysis (Fig. 1B). Mass spectrometry gave a molecular weight of 10,254 Da, which corresponds to a fragment comprising Glu52 to Cys142.
To additionally test our hypothesis that the N- and C-terminus are highly flexible and unstructured we compared the 2D 1H–15N HSQC spectra of uniformly 15N-labeled full-length mSOST and mSOSTΔNC. Residues located in the termini of mSOST exhibit amide proton chemical shift values between 7.5 and 8.5 ppm indicative for random coil conformation (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Full-length ACE2 consists of an Nterminal PD and a C-terminal collectrin-like domain (CLD) that ends with a single transmembrane helix and a ~40-residue intracellular segment (15, 21).
The high resolution supported reliable model building. For ACE2, side chains could be assigned to residues 19 to 768, which contain the PD (residues 19 to 615) and the CLD (residues 616 to 768), which consists of a small extracellular domain, a long linker, and the single TM helix (Fig. 1C).
The C-terminal tail starting on residue 769 has no density in the structure and is therefore disordered
Using this new labeling strategy specifically tailored for phosphotyrosines, it was possible to generate the time profiles for 318 unique phosphopeptides belonging to 215 proteins from an erlotinib-treated breast cancer cell line model.
In the GLUT1 structure, residues 9–455 constitute the canonical MFS fold whereas the C-terminal segment was invisible probably due to its inherent flexibility in this conformation (Fig. 1).
As in 4PYP, residues 1–8 and 456–504 were not visible in density maps and are not part of our structures.
Here, we used NMR spectroscopy in combination with small angle X-ray scattering and dynamic light scattering to characterize the dynamic and structural properties of full-length human HP1β (hHP1β) in solution. We show that the hinge region is highly flexible and enables a largely unrestricted spatial search by the two globular domains for their binding partners
Besides the two structurally related CD (21–71) and CSD (110–170), the remainder of the protein, which accounts for more than one third of the sequence, has a non-globular character with a high percentage of charged residues. The non-globular nature of the hinge region and the N- and C-terminal tails lead to severe signal overlap between 8 and 8.5 ppm in the 1H dimension and a large dynamic range of peak intensities.
For most residues in the tails and the hinge region the absolute values of Cα secondary chemical shifts were below 0.3 ppm (figure 2C and, for the combined secondary chemical shifts see figure S1), supporting their intrinsically disordered nature. In the hinge region a weak helical tendency expands the α-helix of the CD beyond residue 70 up to 73. In addition, a continuous stretch of small negative Cα secondary shifts in proximity to residue 20 points to a propensity for extended conformations in the N-terminal tail. 

According to 15N spin relaxation rates the backbone outside of CD and CSD is highly mobile (figure 3).
The limits of the region are determined from the NMR data in Figures 2, 3 and 4

Comparison of the R g distribution derived from the optimized ensembles with that obtained from a pool of randomly generated models is shown in figure 1D. The R g distribution of the selected ensemble is nearly as broad as the one from the initial random pool, with the maximum shifted towards longer distances, indicating that the hinge region is highly flexible with a preference for more extended conformations.

Dynamic light scattering measurements resulted in a well-defined monodisperse peak with a hydrodynamic radius of 4.4±0.1 nm (figure 1A). The value is in agreement with the results from pulse field gradient NMR (figure 1B) and indicates that the protein does not assume a compact state in solution.

The N- and C-terminal tails as well as the hinge region showed much smaller J(0) and bigger J(0.87ωH) than the two globular domains, indicating a very slow decay of their spectral density function characteristic of fast tumbling molecules with high internal mobility.
The J(0.87ωH) profile demonstrated that the N-terminal tail experiences smaller internal dynamics when compared to the hinge region, with the C-terminal tail being the most flexible part among the disordered domains (figure S3A).
The limits of the region are determined from the NMR data in Figures 2, 3 and 4
No specific mention in text, but the region 176-185 is missing in the electron density
in the absence of methylation, the hinge region and the N-terminal tail form weak nucleosome contacts mainly with DNA. In agreement with the high flexibility within the hHP1β-H3K9me3 nucleosome complex, the chromoshadow domain does not provide a direct binding interface. 
The high correspondence of NMR signal perturbations indicated that the very N terminus and the hinge region of hHP1β transiently associate with DNA of the unmodified nucleosome. The most affected part inside the hinge region has been identified within residues 97–109, which includes the lysine patch (residues 101–104) that previous mutagenesis studies have shown to be essential for the interaction between hHP1α and DNA (19)

Here we showed that hHP1β explores a wide conformational space by populating an extended ensemble. Due to the high flexibility of the hinge region the two globular domains, CD and CSD, remain independent [...] In addition, the intrinsic disorder of the hinge region facilitates post-translational modifications by enzymes such as protein kinases [18], [38], makes the linker an accessible hold for interaction with nucleic acids [18], [20], [21], [39] and increases the exposure of the nuclear localization sequence for proper localization [37].

The asymmetric unit contains two copies of the vinculin monomer and the proline-rich linker, speculated to function as a hinge for the protein Price et al. 1989, Brindle et al. 1996, was largely disordered.
The N- and C-terminal helical bundles are indicated. In one monomer in the asymmetric unit residues 853–872 are disordered, while residues 853-878 are disordered in the other monomer in the asymmetric unit. These residues span vinculin's proline-rich linker. For clarity, all figures of full-length vinculin show residues 1–840 and 879–1066.
However, disordered regions were difficult to parameterize in terms of multiple conformations at the given resolution, which led to relatively high B factor and R factor statistics for the single-conformation models used, and did limit the scope of reliably assigning bound water molecules.
As shown in Fig. 2B and C, similar dissociation constants (Kd) were obtained for vin857 (1.08 μM) and vin837 (1.16 μM) with the tandem SH3 domains, and the stoichiometries of vin857 and vin837 were both determined to be 1, indicating that vin857 is sufficient for the interaction.
Because no inter-domain NOEs are observed between the SH3a and SH3b domains after their binding to vin857 (data not shown), the enhanced binding affinity is most likely caused by the flexible linker, which tethers both the SH3a and SH3b domains and restricts the dissociation ability of the individual SH3 domains from the substrate.
Additionally, almost the same NMR chemical shift perturbations were observed in the 15N-HSQC spectra of the tandem SH3 domains upon titration with the vin837 and vin857 peptides (Fig. S3), consistent with the above-mentioned ITC results.
In this study, we first determined the solution structure of the tandem SH3 domains of CAP and further analyzed its complex structure with the proline-rich linker of vinculin using ITC, NMR, and X-ray crystallography.
The binding motif of the SH3 domain of Vinculin (857-879) is composed of two short proline-rich regions (prr): prr1 (N- LAPPKPPLPE -C), corresponding to PDB:4ln2, and prr2 (N- VPPPRPPPPE -C), corresponding to PDB:4lnp.

Vinculin plays a critical role in the regulation of focal adhesion by providing the link between the actin cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Vinculin can directly interact with actin by two regions located in the Vt domain: one of these regions is exposed in “inactive” vinculin, and the other region is hidden by its interaction with the D1 domain (Janssen et al., 2006). It has been reported that CAP can directly interact with actin using its N-terminal region and co-localize with F-actin in cells without its tandem SH3 domains.

The final refined atomic model contains residues 140–288 and 335–416 for chains A and C, and 140–289 and 337–416 for chains B and D, respectively.
In order to help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of cIAP1 activity and to explore the possibility of targeting cIAP1 activity with small molecules, we have determined the crystal structures of the BIR3 domain of cIAP1 in complex with N-terminal hexapeptides of the activated (cleaved) forms of both SMAC and caspase-9. 
The caspase-9 peptide (ATPFQE) binds to the BIR3 domain of cIAP2 with an afﬁnity of 48 ± 2nM, whereas the SMAC peptide (AVPIAQ) binds with an afﬁnity of 85 ± 8nM.
Surprisingly, a clear electron density is only observed starting from residues 144 and 149 in chains A and B, respectively. Moreover, SDS-PAGE analysis of the crystals confirmed that the fragment was intact (mass 11.1 kDa). In addition, first few traceable residues in each chain are mobile, as evident from increased B-factors. Both the coil 1A and most of the linker L1 are therefore completely disordered in this crystal structure.
With the exception of residues 144 to 149 (shown in orange) in chain A, the rest of the linker L1 and coil 1A is disordered in the crystals.
Although the presence of the nonhelical head domains is essential for proper tetramer stabilization, the precise alignment of the dimers forming the tetramer appears to depend on the complementarity of their surface charge distribution patterns, while the structural plasticity of linker L1 and coil 1A plays a role in the subsequent IF assembly process.
Coil 1A corresponds to region 99-139 and linker L1 corresponds to region 140-147.

SopB is a multidomain protein, which like P1 ParB contains an all-helical DNA-binding domain that is flexibly attached to a compact (β3–α)2 dimer-domain.
However, density was only observed for SopB residues 157–271 from one subunit and 157–270 of the second subunit. These residues contain all the determinants required for sequence specific binding to the sopC consensus site (36). The absence of density for the SopB N- and C-terminal regions suggested that either these regions were highly flexible or were proteolysed during crystallization. Consistent with the former possibility, the first and last residues observed, 157 and 271, each face into large solvent channels, which could easily accommodate the disordered or flexibly attached domains.
The structure indicates that SopB consists of three main regions: 1–155, 155–272 and 272–323 that are flexibly linked.
The fact that the N- and C-terminal regions are not visible in the FL SopB-18mer structure indicates that these three principal regions of SopB are flexibly attached.
The C-terminal dimerization domain of SopB is highly flexible.
Previous studies suggest that SopB residues 275–323 are involved in dimer formation and therefore must form a folded domain, consistent with our CD studies (36). Thus, we next produced and crystallized SopB(275–323).
The structure revealed that, indeed, residues 275–323 form a highly intertwined dimer composed of 3 β-strands and 1 α-helix with topology (β1; 276–281, β2; 284–289, β3; 292–298 α1; 306–318) (Figure 2A–D). The dimer is stabilized almost entirely by backbone, β-strand hydrogen bonds. The interface of the dimer buries an extensive 5990 Å2 of protein surface from solvent, consistent with it forming the primary dimerization domain of SopB, which anchors the SopB subunits on a palindromic DNA site (see Figure 3). That the C-domain is a physiologically relevant oligomer is also supported by the finding that the identical dimer is observed twice in the crystal (the dimers overlay with an RMSD of 0.6 Å) and size exclusion chromatography data providing a MW of 13 kDa for SopB(275–323) [compared to a calculated MW of 11.2 kDa for a SopB(275–323) dimer].

Limited proteolysis of MoMOD1 revealed two regions that are resistant to digestion, these correspond to the conserved sequences in the HP1-like proteins[…] The results suggest that the MoMOD1 protein consists of two structural domains, residues 10-78 and 104-171, connected by an exposed linker.

By measuring the heteronuclear NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Effect) data for backbone amides, we identified disordered regions, which exist at the N-terminus (residues 131 to 140 of intact HP1a), and the CTE (residues 202 to 206)
To delineate the features of the ordered structure, we generated crystals of the CSD construct and determined the atomic structure at 2.3 Å resolution (Table I). The symmetric dimer resembles that of the mammalian HP1β [8b]. We found contiguous electron density corresponding to the N-terminal residue Thr 141 through the C-terminal residues Ser 199 in chain A and Tyr 201 in chain B
Although Y14 residues 50–168 are present in the Y14t-Magoh complex crystals, only residues 64–165 are sufficiently well ordered to be visualized in the electron density.
Although diffraction data were collected from a complex containing residues 13-235 of CFIm68 (Figure S2B), the refined electron density map showed interpretable density only for residues 81-172, a segment which comprises the entire RRM domain (residues 81-160).

Similar to the TNPO3-SRSF1 co-crystal structure, only a fraction of the input CPSF6 RSLD (9 of the 70 residues) was ordered in the density map.

We analyzed Rengase-1 derived from Mus musculus and solved the structures of the four domains; NTD, PIN, ZF, and CTD individually by X-ray crystallography or NMR (Fig. 1a–e). X-ray crystallography was attempted for the fragment containing both the PIN and ZF domains, however, electron density was observed only for the PIN domain (Fig. 1c), consistent with a previous report on Regnase-1 derived from Homo sapiens11.
A Regnase-1 construct consisting of PIN and ZF domains derived from Mus musculus was crystallized; however, the electron density of the ZF domain was low, indicating that the ZF domain is highly mobile in the absence of target mRNA or possibly other protein-protein interactions.
Our NMR experiments confirmed direct binding of the ZF domain to IL-6 mRNA with a Kd of 10 ± 1.1 μM. Furthermore, an in vitro gel shift assay indicated that Regnase-1 containing the ZF domain enhanced target mRNA-binding, but the protein-RNA complex remained in the bottom of the well without entering into the polyacrylamide gel. These results indicate that Regnase-1 directly binds to RNA and precipitates under such experimental conditions.

Our findings suggest that Regnase-1 cleaves its target mRNA by an NTD-activated functional PIN dimer, while the ZF increases RNA affinity in the vicinity of the PIN dimer.

The N-terminus of each subunit was disordered, with the final model including residues 94–205 from each subunit.
In all subunits, the first 27 N-terminal residues of the sfALR construct (Figure S1; comprising 14 residues of the tag and linker, followed by 13 residues from the N-terminus of the cytokine form of ALR) were disordered.
The final model of human cGAS, except for the disordered regions (residues 218-222, 255-260, 289-305, 363-370 and 426-427), was refined to an R-factor of 20.6% (R free = 25.2%).
Here, we present a combination of SAXS and NMR data to describe the conformational ensemble of the PaaA2 antitoxin from the human pathogen E. coli O157
We show that the conformational ensemble of PaaA2 is highly compact and that the protein exists in solution as two preformed helices, connected by a flexible linker, that probably act as molecular recognition elements for toxin inhibition.
The structural properties of PaaA2 in solution were further investigated by SAXS measurements (Figure 3A and Table S2). The SAXS data also indicate that PaaA2 is an IDP-like protein as the normalized Kratky plot displays the behavior of a highly flexible biomolecule (Figure 3A, inset).
comparison of the experimentally determined Rg of PaaA2 with the values expected for an IDP of similar length (63 amino acids) or a globular protein with a similar molecular mass (∼8.5 kDa) suggests that the behavior of PaaA2 in solution most resembles that of an IDP and not of a globular protein (Figure 3B).
Altogether, these findings reveal that, in the absence of its cognate binding partner ParE2, the PaaA2 antitoxin in solution harbors two α helices connected by a flexible linker
Although PaaA2 may assume a certain level of compactness, it is clear that the protein neither adopts a globular conformation nor contains a hydrophobic core. Although the former is supported by the analytical SEC and DLS experiments, the latter is evidenced by the thermal unfolding data
 Second, the structural study of PaaA2 reveals that the antitoxin is a monomer composed of two α helices connected by a highly flexible linker. Interestingly, these pre-existing α helices align well with the toxin-binding elements of the archetypal RelB antitoxins. Therefore, we hypothesize that these helices act as molecular recognition elements that allow PaaA2 to efficiently bind the ParE2 toxin. Given that the helices are preformed, PaaA2 probably interacts with its cognate toxin through the mechanism of conformational selection

We show that the conformational ensemble of PaaA2 is highly compact and that the protein exists in solution as two preformed helices, connected by a flexible linker, that probably act as molecular recognition elements for toxin inhibition.
Estimation of the antitoxin’s secondary structure content based on the analysis of the CD spectrum reveals that PaaA2 consists of random coil with a significant amount of α helices (∼35% α helicity; Figure 2A and Table S1)
it is noteworthy that the denaturation is fully reversible (Figure S2) and that the thermal profile is not sigmoidal, suggesting that the unfolding event occurs through a noncooperative process.

The analytical SEC and DLS experiments indicate that PaaA2 displays IDP-like features and adopts an extended, nonglobular conformation (Figures 2B and 2C). The ratios between the apparent and theoretical values for molecular mass (Mr,app/Mr,theor) and hydrodynamic radius (Rh,app/Rh,theor) are 2.2–2.8 and 1.3–1.6, respectively, which is a typical trait for IDPs

The fully assigned 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of PaaA2 shows that most of the backbone amide resonances are confined to a narrow spectral region (Figure 4A), typical for IDPs or proteins with a high α-helical content (Wüthrich, 1986,  Wishart et al., 1991). On the other hand, δ2D (Camilloni et al., 2012), which is benchmarked for IDPs, identifies two stable cores existing in an α-helical conformation for more than 80% of the time: residues Asn22 to Arg26 and Glu46 to Glu51 for helices 1 and 2, respectively (Figure 4C). These core regions coincide with the predicted α helices and contain flanking regions with percentages of α helicity between 15% and 80% (Figure 4C), which is overall in agreement with the CD data (Table S1). All of the other residues are predicted to adopt a coil-like conformation. In agreement with these predictions, the NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra indicate the absence of β sheet signatures and contain peaks characteristic of α helices.

The antitoxin EcPaaA2 is characterized by tha helices (H1 ans H2) that serve as molecular recognition elements to wrap itself around EcParE2
In this antitoxin-toxin heterodimer, the EcPaaA2 completely wraps itself around EcParE2 in an all alpha helical conformation and covers an accessible surface area of around 1500 A2 on EcParE2
The EcPaaA2 antitoxin was recently found to be an intrinsically disordered protein with a broad conformational ensemble but containing two alpha helices. When bound to its cognate toxin these two transient helices stabilize and extend to encompass residues I15-A34 and H42-S61 (H1 and H2), the remaining aminoacids adopt defined loop conformations

Although PaaA2 may assume a certain level of compactness, it is clear that the protein neither adopts a globular conformation nor contains a hydrophobic core. Although the former is supported by the analytical SEC and DLS experiments, the latter is evidenced by the thermal unfolding data.
Second, the structural study of PaaA2 reveals that the antitoxin is a monomer composed of two α helices connected by a highly flexible linker. Interestingly, these pre-existing α helices align well with the toxin-binding elements of the archetypal RelB antitoxins. Therefore, we hypothesize that these helices act as molecular recognition elements that allow PaaA2 to efficiently bind the ParE2 toxin. Given that the helices are preformed, PaaA2 probably interacts with its cognate toxin through the mechanism of conformational selection
The entire protein is an IDP, but regions 16-28 and 42-57 are in a helical conformation, constituting two preformed helices. The boundaries of these helices are not strictly defined as the core region is helical >80% of the time and the flanking regions have decreasing fraction of helicity as the helical content is highly dynamic in the ensemble. The boundary established by the authors in the text is taken, which is highly coincident with the models deposited in the PDB where the helices range from residues 14-29 and 43-57
Here, we present a combination of SAXS and NMR data to describe the conformational ensemble of the PaaA2 antitoxin from the human pathogen E. coli O157
We show that the conformational ensemble of PaaA2 is highly compact and that the protein exists in solution as two preformed helices, connected by a flexible linker, that probably act as molecular recognition elements for toxin inhibition
The fully assigned 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of PaaA2 shows that most of the backbone amide resonances are confined to a narrow spectral region (Figure 4A), typical for IDPs or proteins with a high α-helical content 
Chemical shift-based secondary structure predictions with DANGLE and TALOS+ suggest the presence of two a helices (residues Glu16 to Lys28 and His42 to Arg57), connected by a linker segment (Figure 4B), which is in agreement with our bioinformatics analysis.
On the other hand, δ2D (Camilloni et al., 2012), which is benchmarked for IDPs, identifies two stable cores existing in an α-helical conformation for more than 80% of the time: residues Asn22 to Arg26 and Glu46 to Glu51 for helices 1 and 2, respectively (Figure 4C). These core regions coincide with the predicted α helices and contain flanking regions with percentages of α helicity between 15% and 80% (Figure 4C), which is overall in agreement with the CD data (Table S1). All of the other residues are predicted to adopt a coil-like conformation. In agreement with these predictions, the NOE spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra indicate the absence of β sheet signatures and contain peaks characteristic of α helices.

Here we report the ectodomain structures of the SARS-CoV surface spike trimer in different conformational states determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The conformation 1 determined at 4.3 Å resolution is three-fold symmetric and has all the three receptor-binding C-terminal domain 1 (CTD1s) of the S1 subunits in “down” positions. The binding of the “down” CTD1s to the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 is not possible due to steric clashes, suggesting that the conformation 1 represents a receptor-binding inactive state.
Conformation 1 determined at 4.3 Å resolution corresponds to PDB:5WRG.

No clear electron density was evident for N-terminal residues 332–344, HR A loops residues 361–365, HR F residues 558–562, and the C-terminal residues 595–620.
The final model has excellent density for most residues except for the N-terminal flexible loop (Pro50–Val71) and a small internal loop (Asp212–Ser215).
the N-terminal flexible loop at Pro50–Val71 corresponds to Pro51-Val72.
No electron density is associated with residues 305–316 of chain A and 155–157, 183–186, 232–243, and 305–316 of chain B, so these regions were omitted from the model.

This might be due to flexibility within the region (residues 79 to 89) connecting the N-terminal and coiled-coil domains as documented by the sensitivity to proteolysis and the absence of an ordered structure for residues 80 to 88.

Nef… contains an N-terminal membrane anchor domain of 60–120 amino acids length followed by a core domain of 130–150 amino acids, containing a highly conserved dileucine-based sorting motif at the center of a C-terminal flexible loop27. This exposed sorting motif enables Nef to interact with AP2 and to induce the internalization of its target receptors.

We find that Nef is indeed able to act like an adapter by binding to dileucine-based sorting motifs embedded in the plasma membrane while simultaneously exposing its own dileucine motif within the C-terminal flexible loop to the cytosol. This is possible by a dipolar electrostatic surface charge character of Nef. The hydrophobic crevice that interacts with the dileucine motifs is surrounded by positively charged residues, whereas the C-terminal flexible loop with the ExxxLL sorting motif in its center is largely negatively charged. This enables Nef to pick up the cytosolic tail sequences of T cell surface receptors at the plasma membrane and couple them to the endocytic adapter protein machinery. 
We show by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) and allied methods that simian tetherin is targeted in a unique way by the induced refolding of the b subunit of AP-2 from an a-helix to a b-hairpin, creating a binding site for the (G/D)DIWK motif in a crevice between the new b-hairpin and Nef
However, when bound to both tetherin and Nef, b2 (peptide 7–18) underwent 40% less HD exchange (30 s) (Figures 4C and S4A). Slower deuteration was also seen in a and s2 residues in SIVsmm Nef binding regions (Figures S4B and S4C), as expected. The finding that protection from amide HD exchange in the b2 N terminus depends on the presence of both SIVsmm Nef and tetherin strongly supports the conclusions drawn from the cryo-EM structure, which shows that the presence of these two molecules together is required for refolding of this region

The C-terminal flexible loop of Nef that contained the endocytic dileucine motif was partly truncated in the crystallized complex, nonetheless no electron density was observed starting from residues 155 to 179, in line with the assumption of a flexible loop section (Figure 5A).
Models of x-ray structures and electron density were produced using PyMOL (Schrodinger). The final structure includes Nef-SF2core residues 72–161 and 183–208 for chain A, residues 71–154 and 182–208 for chain C, Hck32 residues 83–246 for chain B, and residues 83–176 and 182–246 for chain D.

In the crystal structure, two Nef–HckSH3-B6 complexes form symmetrical contacts by mutual interactions of the 33 residues encompassing C-terminal flexible loop with the core domain structure of the opposing Nef molecule (Figure 3A).

They interact with residues in the range of F94 to T121 of the Nef core domain, completed by V70-R75 of the PxxP loop and V186 of the terminal β-strand β5.
In this study we determined a structural conformation of the dileucine-based sorting motif in the C-terminal flexible loop of Nef. The Nef protein of primate lentiviruses HIV and SIV is the only non-transmembrane protein known to traffic via a dileucine motif 36. This endocytic sorting signal is required for the stimulated internalization of T-cell receptor molecules from the surface of an infected cell by Nef and a key factor for the pathogenicity of HIV.

By combining information about the sequence at the μ2 cleavage site (31) with knowledge of the μ2 structure, we can identify the protease-sensitive segment as a disordered loop around residue 224 (not, as one might have expected, the interdomain linker). The same loop is present and disordered in μ1
The disordered region corresponds to residues 219-231
An unstructured region of μ1 (residues 218–231) becomes ordered to interact with both Nef and the MHC-I CD [...] Residues 215–233 of μ1 rearrange from a disordered loop in the crystal structure of the AP1 core into a helix-turn motif when in complex with the MHC-I CD and Nef.

The first three and last 16 residues of each HipB subunit are disordered and located near a small β-sheet, that is composed of β1 and β1′ (from the other subunit) and forms a “β–lid” (Fig. 2A).
To test the hypothesis that the 16 residue C-terminal stretch is critical for degradation, we cloned a truncated HipB (HipB72) lacking the last 16 residues of HipB into pBR creating pBRhipB72. We measured the rate of in vivo degradation of HipB72 in wild type and Δlon (KLE905 and KLE906, respectively) (Fig. 4). Interestingly, HipB72 is indeed substantially more stabile (t1/2>200 min) than full length HipB in wild type indicating that the unstructured C terminus of HipB is essential for degradation by Lon protease (Fig. 4A). As expected, full length HipB72 is also stable in Δlon background. We purified the truncated HipB (His6-HipB72) and tested it in the Lon in vitro degradation assay. The effect was also noticeable though less pronounced in vitro. The half-life time of HipB changed from 74 min for full length HipB to 130 min in the mutant (Fig. 4B).
Our data show that a disordered C-terminus of HipB serves as a degradation signal for the Lon protease.
Here we report that CspD is subject to proteolysis by the Lon protease both in vivo and in vitro.
To analyse the stability of CspD, in vivo degradation experiments in E. coli MC4100 were performed as described in Experimental procedures . Western blot analysis revealed that CspD indeed is an instable protein (Fig. 2A).

In the repressor complex, AtaR intrinsically disordered region interacts with AtaT at two different sites, folding into different structures, that are involved in two separate functional roles, toxin neutralization and placing the DNA-binding domains of AtaR in a binding-compatible orientation. 


The antitoxin AtaR binds and neutralizes AtaT via its intrinsically disordered C-terminal region (IDR), sufficient to counteract the action of AtaT in vivo

The structure of AtaR shows the RHH dimer adopts an elongated conformation (Fig. 2a). The second α-helix of each monomer extends toward the C terminus from V32 to S69 (S73 to M88 are not visible and are presumably disordered)
While the region with missing residues in the PDB 6GTO is from residues 71-88, the authors limit the region to residues 73-88.
On its own, the C-terminal region of AtaR (AtaRA44–M88) or shorter versions from S60 to M88 (AtaRS60–M88) are largely disordered in solution as shown by circular dichroism spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 3b). The circular dichroism spectra of both, AtaRA44–M88 and AtaRS60–M88, show a lack of secondary structure and a distinctive minimum at 205nm typical of disordered proteins. Moreover, AtaRA44–M88 lacks an observable transition from native to denatured state, also a signature feature of IDRs (Supplementary Fig. 3b).

The structure AtaRA44–M88 in complex with AtaTY144F (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 3d) showed the intrinsically disordered AtaRA44–M88 wrapped around AtaTY144F (encompassing a large interface of ~1,500Å2 ). AtaRA44–M88 is anchored to the surface of AtaT via four structural motifs—mt1 (β-strand), mt2 (α-helix), a proline-rich fragment (P-rich) and mt3 (α-helix) (Fig. 3a–g)

We used AtaR A44–M88 to gain further insights into the mechanism of AtaT neutralization. AtaT Y144F interacts with AtaR A44–M88 with an affinity of 367nM, lower than the affinity for the full length AtaR (Kd=29nM) (Supplementary Fig. 2g,h and Supplementary Table 1).

Removing the last six residues of AtaR (K83 to M88) has a strong effect on growth and when this is extended to nine residues (R80 to M88) neutralization severely drops. These results indicate the neutralization region of AtaR involves almost entirely the IDR.
AtaR neutralizes AtaT via four functional domains located mainly in the C-terminal IDR
The low sedimentation coefficient and large Stokes radius are consistent with Mid1p-N452 purified with phosphatase inhibitors being disordered.

The low sedimentation coefficient and large Stokes radius are consistent with Mid1p-N452 purified with phosphatase inhibitors being disordered.
Static light scattering analysis of the peak of Mid1p-N452 gave a molecular weight of 60 kDa (Figure 3A), which is slightly larger than the molecular weight of 52.7 kDa based on the sequence. Therefore, Mid1pN452 is a monomer with a large hydrodynamic radius.
After uniform labeling of Mid1p-N308 with 15N in bacteria and purification, we recorded 1H −15N HSQC NMR spectra. The peaks in the two-dimensional NMR spectra overlapped and were characterized by limited 1H chemical shift dispersion. These features are characteristic of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) where conformational
averaging within the rapidly interconvertible ensembles results in poor dispersion. Flexibility allows significant chemical exchange of 15N with bulk water, resulting in decreases in 1H −15N signal intensities and a poor signal-to-noise ratio.
The CD spectrum of Mid1p-N452 purified from insect cells with phosphatase inhibitors (Figure 5C) was typical of a disordered protein53 with a minimum at 205 nm and a shoulder at 220 nm.
Differential interference contrast microscopy at room temperature (DIC) revealed that Mid1p-N452 at concentrations from 3.8 to 23 μM formed droplets, which increased in size over time.
Like the wild type protein, Mid1p constructs consisting of residues 1 −50649 or 1 −45220 exit the nucleus during interphase and accumulate in cortical nodes that mature to form cytokinetic nodes and assemble functional contractile rings during mitosis.
Mid1p immunoprecipitates with overexpressed full-length Myo2, but not with a construct lacking 132 residues from C-terminus.
Hence, we assessed the binding of purified Mid1p-N452 to GST-Myo2-tail, a fusion of
GST to Myo2p residues 1441 −1526 that we immobilized on glutathione beads. Mid1p-N452 bound to GST-Myo2 tail (1441 −1526) with a Kd of ∼2 μM (n = 2; 1.9 and 2.2).
TALOS-N CS analysis of Vps75226–264 in the context of full-length Vps752 shows that the Vps75 tail is disordered. The same narrow CS dispersion is observed in the full complex.
When we compared the 1H-15N CSPs of the Vps75 CTAD in the Asf1–H3:H4–Rtt109–Vps752 and the Asf1–H329–135:H4–Rtt109–Vps752 complexes (relative to free Vps752), we observed that the CSPs of residues 234–246 in the complex assembled with N-terminally truncated H3 were smaller than in that assembled with full-length H3 (Fig. 5b), confirming the interaction between the Vps75 CTAD and the H3 tail. Despite binding to each other, both the H3 N-terminal domain and the Vps75 CTAD remain disordered (Figs. 4b, ​,5c5c and Supplementary Fig. 9), hence conserving a substantial portion of their free-form conformational entropy. In agreement with the structural data, the removal of the Vps75 CTAD severely impacts H3-K9ac, but has no effect on H3-K56ac.
We compared the 2D 1H-15N NMR spectrum of H3 in the free histone dimer H3:H4 with those of H3 in the Asf1–H3:H4 complex and after addition of one equivalent of either Vps752 or Vps7521–225. In the presence of Vps752, the chemical shifts of H3 residues 7–37 differed from those measured in either H3:H4 or Asf1–H3:H4, while in the presence of the C-terminally truncated Vps7521–225, the chemical shifts of the H3 tail were identical to those of the free histone dimer (Fig. 4b). This result demonstrates that the H3 tail interacts with the Vps75 CTAD.
We show that Vps75 promotes K9-acetylation by engaging the H3 N-terminal tail in fuzzy electrostatic interactions with its disordered C-terminal domain, thereby confining the H3 tail to a wide central cavity faced by the Rtt109 active site. These fuzzy interactions between disordered domains achieve localization of lysine residues in the H3 tail to the catalytic site with minimal loss of entropy
The histone chaperone Vps75 belongs to the nucleosome assembly protein (NAP-1) family, which can bind to the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4)25. Like Asf1, Vps75 stimulates acetylation of H3 by Rtt10910; however, unlike Asf1, it is critical for H3-K9ac but not for H3-K56ac, and can also facilitate acetylation of K23 and K27.
Vps75 promotes acetylation of K9 via a two-fold mechanism, which differs from a classical interaction between folded and unfolded protein domains. First, the Vps75 dimer acts as a binding platform for both the Asf1–H3:H4 substrate and the Rtt109 enzyme, building a doughnut-like structure with a 25-Å-wide central cavity faced by the Rtt109 catalytic site. Second, the unstructured C-terminal tail of Vps75 (C-terminal acidic domain, CTAD) recruits the similarly unstructured H3 N-terminal tail, containing K9, to this cavity via fuzzy electrostatic interactions. Both the Vps75 CTAD and the H3 N-terminal domain remain disordered, allowing confinement of the H3 tail in proximity to the enzyme active site with minimal entropic penalty.
In contrast to the CAP-Gly domain, the signals of other domains in the protein are poorly dispersed. This is an indication that the extended region of p150Glued(1–191) comprising the basic and SP-rich domains is much less structured than the CAP-Gly domain and may have a substantial proportion of random coil. 
Our results thus indicate that despite the presence of some secondary structures in these segments, the basic and SP-rich domains are intrinsically disordered and unfolded in
free state in solution.
The binding affinity of monomeric p150Glued(1–191) to polymerized MTs was assessed by co-sedimentation assay (Fig. 1 C). More than 98% of p150Glued(1–191) binds to
MTs when equivalent molar concentrations of the protein and the tubulin dimer were used (Fig. 1 C). In comparison, as we and others reported previously, under the identical
conditions, less than half of the CAP-Gly domain protein encompassing residues 19–107 (CAP-Gly19–107) binds to MTs (15). Thus, the binding affinity of p150Glued(1–191) to MTs is significantly higher than that of CAP-Gly(19–107). Th is result validates that p150Glued(1–191) contains a second MT-binding domain other than CAP-Gly, and the
extended region comprised of the basic domain and SP-rich domain assists the interactions between the p150Glued and MTs.
Our results thus indicate that the rigid segments in the basic domain of p150Glued(1–191), S112–R119, A124–R132, and T141–T146, likely comprise most of the residues at the intermolecular interface with MTs (Fig. 7 C). Together with the CAP-Gly domain, they appear to be responsible for the MT-binding interactions of the p150Glued subunit. This finding is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that the basic domain is the second MT-binding segment of p150Glued 
Residues 108–191 of p150Glued(1–191) enhance the binding affinity and contain a second MT-binding region, albeit it is largely unstructured in solution and dynamic upon binding to MTs. Three short and rigid segments in the basic domain, S111–I116, A124–R132, and K144–T146, are predicted to form a-helical and b-sheet structures and are likely to encompass the MT-binding site.
As reported previously, the basic domain of p150Glued (residues 115–145) has the ability to bind with MTs in the absence of CAP-Gly domain and to independently skate along MTs in the absence of dynein (16). In addition, this domain enhances dynein processivity
by fourfold and is responsible for the long-range motility of dynein and its long-time interactions with MTs (16).
More specifically, the K-rich domain (132–152) antagonizes the inhibitory effect of the coiled-coil 1 domain (CC1) (residues 214–547) in the MT-binding affinity of p150Glued (17).
In contrast to the CAP-Gly domain, the signals of other domains in the protein are poorly dispersed. This is an indication that the extended region of p150Glued(1–191) comprising the basic and SP-rich domains is much less structured than the CAP-Gly domain and may have a substantial proportion of random coil.
We also speculate that the N-terminal tail (1–25) of p150Glued(1–191) may contain
an anchoring point at residue R11 for interacting with the tubulin’s C-terminal tail (Fig. 7). In a previous study, the N-terminal segment 1–25 has been proposed to secure the
binding of CAP-Gly to MTs by wrapping around tubulin’s E-hook (13). According to our results, R11 is the only residue that is detected at 4C and exhibits strong peak intensity in the segment 1–25, indicating that R11 is possibly involved in binding interactions with tubulin.
In the N-terminal segment of p150Glued (residues 1–144), the N-terminal tail (residues 1–25) and the basic patch (residues 106–144) greatly increase the binding affinity of the
segment to MTs, and these patches affect the lateral associations of tubulins by interacting with the tubulin’s E-hook(13).

We utilized far-UV CD to study the effect of osmotic pressure on secondary structure within the IDD. Ethylene glycol (EG) and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-400 were employed to test for structural changes within the IDD that may be induced by changes in osmotic pressure. The results indicated that the SMBIDD fragment alone exhibited ellipticity characteristic of a protein fold devoid of classical secondary structure elements (Figure 2a).
This analysis indicates that the isolated SMB-IDD is a significantly flexible structure, existing over a relatively broad Rg range of ~20-55 Å
Our prior work using hydrodynamic methods with PAI-1 and full-length vitronectin demonstrated that there is a 2:1 (PAI-1:vitronectin) stoichiometry of interaction that leads to assembly of higher-order oligomeric complexes via a prominent intermediate containing four PAI-1 and two vitronectin molecules.
Calculated structures for the PAI-1:SMBIDD complex suggest that the IDD provides an interaction surface outside of the primary PAI-1-binding site located within the SMB domain; this binding is proposed to lead to the assembly of higher-order structures of vitronectin and PAI-1 commonly found in tissues.
Analysis of the SANS data using the Ensemble Optimization Method confirms that the SMBIDD adopts a more compact configuration when bound to PAI-1.

Analysis of the SANS data using the Ensemble Optimization Method confirms that the SMBIDD adopts a more compact configuration when bound to PAI-1. 
We compared the Rg values for free vs. bound SMB-IDD and observed that PAI-1 binding yields a shift in the Rg range for the SMB-IDD to predominantly lower values, consistent with a solution structure for the IDD that is restricted in conformation upon binding
In a series of SANS experiments to test for structural changes in the SMB-IDD, it was observed that PAI-1 binding led to structural reorganization of the IDD into a more compact structure. This result localizes an additional binding site for PAI-1 to the linker region in vitronectin.
To localize the putative binding site, we constructed a truncated form of vitronectin containing 71 amino acids from the N-terminus, including the SMB domain and an additional 24 amino acids from the IDD region. This portion of the IDD is rich in acidic amino acids, which are hypothesized to be complementary to several basic residues identified within an extensive vitronectin-binding site mapped on PAI-1 (Schar, Jensen, Christensen, Blouse, Andreasen, Peterson. J Biol Chem. 2008;283:10297-10309). Steady-state and stopped-flow fluorescence measurements demonstrate that the truncated form of vitronectin exhibits the same rapid biphasic association as full-length vitronectin and that the IDD hosts the elusive second PAI-1 binding site that lies external to the SMB domain of vitronectin. 
Dashed lines indicate disordered residues in the reactive center loop (RCL) of PAI-1 and residues leading to the RGD sequence of somatomedin B.
The final model includes residues 6–337 and 348–379 of PAI-1 and 3–39 of SMB.
In a complex with PAI-1, the RGD sequence (residues 45–47 of the somatomedin B domain, Fig. 1b,c) will be positioned close to PAI-1, together with the rest of the large vitronectin molecule, leaving insufficient room for the RGD sequence to bind to integrins in the manner seen in the recent crystal structure of the integrin–RGD ligand complex
The numbering of the IDR that includes the RGD motif (64-66) of vitronectin, correspond to region 59-70 of the associated UniProt sequence, since PDB:1OC0 spans residues 20-70 of the protein.
The interaction of the plasma protein vitronectin with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is central to human health. Vitronectin binding extends the lifetime of active PAI-1, which controls hemostasis by inhibiting fibrinolysis and has also been implicated in angiogenesis. The PAI-1–vitronectin binding interaction also affects cell adhesion and motility. For these reasons, elevated PAI-1 activities are associated both with coronary thrombosis and with a poor prognosis in many cancers. Here we show the crystal structure at a resolution of 2.3 Å of the complex of the somatomedin B domain of vitronectin with PAI-1. The structure of the complex explains how vitronectin binds to and stabilizes the active conformation of PAI-1. It also explains the tissue effects of PAI-1, as PAI-1 competes for and sterically blocks the interaction of vitronectin with cell surface receptors and integrins.

The obtained  CD  spectrum  of AB_hRXG is  typical for proteins  containing  disordered  regions (Figure 4A). It is characterized by a deep minimum at 200 nm and a lack of distinct minima at 208 nm and 222 nm, with only a shallow minimum at 222 nm, which suggests the existence of  some secondary structure.
The remarkably bigger experimental Rs in comparison to the theoretical value places AB_hRXG on the  log (Rs)  versus  log (M)  plot  in the  area for IDPs with  PMG-like  properties (Figure 5B).
The remarkably bigger experimental Rs in comparison to the theoretical value places AB_hRXG on the  log (Rs)  versus  log (M)  plot  in the  area for IDPs with  PMG-like  properties (Figure 5B).
The estimated molecular mass (13 490 Da, 13 260 Da and 13108  Da)  was  close  to the  theoretical  value  (14054Da)  and the  c(s)  distribution obtained for different protein concentration overlaps, indicating that AB_hRXG is a monomer with a highly  extended  conformation. The  obtained  Stokes  radii  (Rs)  for the different concentrations  of AB_hRXG (28.6  Å)  were in good  agreement  with the SEC  data  (27.5  Å).
The calculated f/f0ratio for AB_hRXG is 1.8 (Table 2), which indicates an extended conformation and again classifies AB_hRXGto the PMG-like IDPs.
AB_hRXG in the absence of osmolyte appearedto be very sensitive to trypsin (Figure 7;  lines  6,  10  and  14)  and  proteinase  K  digestion
Taken  together,  the  data  show  that  AB_hRXG exhibits the ability  to  promote the formation of LLPS and that the process is concentration-and temperature-dependent.
To observe the formation of liquid droplets, a concentration of around 3 mg/ml and higher was needed.
Size exclusion chromatography of scSpp2(10–185) resulted in an apparent molecular mass of approximately 65 kDa, roughly three times higher than the calculated molecular mass of scSpp2(10–185). In contrast, multiangle light scattering identified this truncated Spp2 as a monomer, indicating that the protein behaves like a partially or fully unfolded protein.
In addition, CD measurements were performed with scSpp2(10–150) as well as with the further truncated version scSpp2(100–150) containing only the G-patch region. The CD spectra clearly show the absence of stable secondary structure elements for both samples
To study the properties of scSpp2 in more detail, a heteronuclear singular quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectrum of 15N-labeled scSpp2(10–185) was recorded (Fig. 1C). The NMR spectrum was of high quality with a narrow distribution of the cross peaks around 8 ppm of the 1H frequency, which is typical for the spectra of intrinsically disordered proteins.
Authors performed and infer information on binding using a homologous protein!
Binding experiments of different truncated versions of ctSpp2G-patch show that this N-terminal helix is sufficient for binding to the DEAH-box ATPase and thus likely displays the major anchor point of the G-patch motif.
In particular, glycines 223, 226, and 230 of ctSpp2 exhibit conformations allowed only for glycine residues, and mutation to serine strongly weakens the binding of the ctSpp2G-patch to ctPrp2 (SI Appendix, Fig. S7).
The Prp2-specific cofactor Spp2 belongs to the family of G-patch–containing proteins. The name-giving glycine-rich patch (G-patch) consists of at least six conserved glycines and was first identified in RNA-associated proteins by bioinformatic analysis (20).
Spp2, which stimulates only the RNA-dependent ATPase activity of isolated Prp2 and not any helicase activity (24). Actually, no helicase activity could be observed for isolated Prp2 or the Prp2-Spp2 complex within the spliceosome (25, 26).
Spp2G-patch is unfolded in solution and only transiently samples an α-helical conformation in its N-terminal part. This N-terminal amphipathic helix stably binds Prp2 mainly via hydrophobic interactions with a conserved hydrophobic patch at the winged-helix (WH) domain. The C-terminal part binds to the RecA2 domain and can adopt two alternative conformations.
In all crystal forms of the ctPrp2-ctSpp2211–254 complex, the N-terminal residues 212 to 222 of the G-patch domain form an amphipathic α-helix that is bound to the WH domain (Fig. 2A). The α-helix is terminated by a sharp kink, followed by a region exhibiting an extended conformation reaching the β-hairpin of the RecA2 domain. The C-terminal part of the ctSpp2 G-patch adopts two alternative conformations in the five different crystal structures.
The transition was observed for a homologous protein!
In 1:1-bound ΔN165, whose resonances were well resolved, 88 of the 95 assigned residues overlapped with ΔN117, with all PEST residues clustered around 8.2 ± 0.2 parts per million (ppm) on the 1H dimension, a chemical shift characteristic of disordered structures.
Thus, the local structure of the ETS domain was not altered upon DNA binding by the flanking residues, and the PEST domain behaved as a disordered tether in the ETS/DNA complex.
Comparison of DNA binding by ΔN117 and ΔN165 shows that the N-terminally tethered PEST domain enhanced the affinity of the 1:1 complex but reduced the affinity of the 2:1 complex
The disordered PEST promotes PU.1 homodimerization
Multiple orthogonal probes therefore described a reversible ΔN117 dimer that was considerably more avid than ΔN165.
Although the transition at 50 mM Na+ corresponded to a dissociation constant of ~200 μM, it was still fivefold higher than that for ΔN117 in 150 mM Na+ (Fig. 5B). The data, therefore, reaffirmed the stimulatory role of the disordered PEST domain in dimerization of the ETS domain while revealing an electrostatic basis in the unbound PU.1 dimer.
Dimerization of the DBD of PU.1 is electrostatically mediated and conformationally destabilizing.
The N-terminal IDR promotes a structurally perturbative PU.1 dimer in the absence of DNA.
spectroscopic and calorimetric measurements showed that the PU.1 ETS dimer was destabilized with respect to unfolding relative to its monomeric constituents. Structural considerations aside, conformational destabilization contributes to the DNA binding deficiency of the apo ETS dimer. A destabilized dimeric state implied favorable concentration-dependent interactions within the unfolded ensemble over the folded state. The ability of the anionic PEST domain to promote formation of the unbound dimer in ΔN117 therefore further suggests a basis in mitigating the electrostatic repulsion among the cationic ETS domains.
Functional studies have established a panel of Ser residues in the PEST domain, including residues 130, 131, 140, and 146 (human numbering), which are multiply phosphorylated in cells (30, 31).
Notably, despite its nominal designation as a proteasome-recruiting signal, the PEST domain does not target PU.1 for metabolic turnover, but it is associated with a local role in dimerization and protein-protein partnerships such as with the lymphoid-specific factor IRF4 (44).
The crystal structure of the STT hetero-dimer complex from Arabidopsis was determined at 2.2 A˚ resolution (Table S1 ). Because the IDRs of STT1 and STT2 are highly mobile, residues 40–112 of STT1 and residues 37–231 of STT2 could not be accurately modeled into the electron density.
Moreover, deletion of IDRs of either STT1 or STT2 substantially impacts binding of OE23 to the STT complex as revealed by pull-down assays.
the STT complex was able to bind the LMNG-solubilized synthetic transit peptide of OE23 (KD =8 mM) at an approximately 1:1 protein: peptide ratio
ITC-based titration assays also demonstrated that deletion of the IDRs of either STT1 or STT2 substantially impaired binding of cpTat transit peptide to the STT complex, showing an 20-fold and 10-fold higher KD, respectively
Our results showed that 0.5 mM in vitro-translated OE23 precursor could also induce the STTs (2.5 mM) phase separation (Figure 4B).
Substitution of the residues of the LTP binding motif within the STTs prevented phase separation (Figure S4A). Thus, besides formation of STT oligomers, the STTs-LTP binding reaction is also required for this phase separation.

Previous studies on the RNA binding of U2AF2mostly focused on RRM1 and RRM2, but suggested a potential role of the intervening linker region (residues 231 to 258) for regulating the dynamic RNA recognition by U2AF2
The RRM1–RRM2 linker is flexible, as indicated by low heteronuclear NOE values. The highest flexibility is ob-served for the N-terminal region of the linker (residues 235 to249), beyond the residues (D231/Y232) that stabilize helixα0.Consistently, NMR signals corresponding to these N-terminal linker residues (residues 235 to 245) in NMR spectra of the constructs, RRM1–linker and linker–RRM2, superimpose well with those in the spectrum of RRM1,2, indicative of their intrinsically disordered nature and absence of contacts to RRM1or RRM2
Indeed, our experimental heteronuclear NOEvalues display a gradual increase in the C-terminal region of the linker (residues 250 to 258) toward the RRM2 domain, indicative of limited flexibility (Fig. 1C). This is consistent with the interaction of the C-terminal region of the RRM1–RRM2 linker with the RNA binding interface of RRM2, as seen in our structure (Fig. 1B), although in a dynamic manner.
 the C-terminal region of the linker (residues 250 to 259) adopts a well-defined confor-mation in the solution structure and binds to RRM2, supported by84 distance restraints derived from proton–proton nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOEs) between the linker and RRM2. In detail, three residues (V250/S251/T252) are packed against to the N-terminal end of strandβ2 in RRM2 (K286/A288/F288) in an antiparallel manner, while the rest of this region (residues 253 to259) interacts with residues in the RRM2β-sheet.
First, two additional short helices form at the N terminus of RRM1, helixα0, and at the C terminus of RRM2, helixαC (Fig. 1B). In particular, the orientation of the N-terminal helix is stabilized by interactions with residues at the N-terminal region of the RRM1–RRM2 linker(D231/Y232)
The Linker Plays an Autoinhibitory Role in Py-Tract RNA Binding.The interaction with the RNA binding interface of RRM2 suggests a potential role of the RRM1–RRM2 linker in regulating RNA binding. To further explore this, we removed the linker/RRM2contacts by replacing the core linker region (residues 233 to 257)with Gly-Gly-Ser repeats of the same length
RRM1,2-GS comprises two functional RRM domains butlacks the contacts of the RRM1,2 linker to RRM2.
the competition of linker and RNA for RRM2favors binding of strong over weak Py-tracts.
These data further corroborate the autoinhibitory role of the linker, and show that the dynamic linker/RRM2 interaction reduces the RNA binding affinity of RRM1,2. The linker thereby proofreads against the binding of weak RNA ligands by directly competing for the RNA binding interface on the RRM2. Of note, the autoinhibitory role of the linker is also recapitulated in the context of the minimal U2AFheterodimer (SI Appendix,Fig.S6B), indicating that the presence of the small subunit U2AF1 does not affect or modulate theRRM2/linker interaction.
The solution structure of dg-alpha hCG is represented by an ensemble of 27 structures. In comparison to the crystal structure of the dimer, the solution structure of free dg-alpha hCG exhibits: (a) an increased structural disorder (residues 33-57); (b) a different backbone conformation near Val76 and Glu77; and (c) a larger flexibility.
The disorder present in the segment comprising residues 33–57 reflects the absence of medium‐and long‐range NOEs. This is in good agreement with the random coil 1H chemical shifts of the corresponding residues
The two hairpins are connected by a disordered loop consisting of the residues 33–57.
From Fig. 6 it is obvious that free dg‐αhCG is a rather flexible molecule. This is reflected by the disorder we observed for the loop comprising residues α33–57, and also by the conformational heterogeneity of the hairpin loop α70–74 and the tight turn α20–23. 
The N‐ and C‐terminal segments, comprising residues 1–10 and 85–92, respectively, are also disordered and stick out into the solution like two arms.
The residues 42-49, 98-108, 146, and 147 of the protein were not observed in the electron density map, which appears to be highly flexible.
The highly flexible region 98-108 corresponds to region 122-132 on the protein sequence, since region 1-25 of the protein was excluded from the crystal structure as it corresponds to a signal peptide.

The  polypeptide  chain  may  be  divided  into  two  major domains, the N-terminal domain (residues, 1-123) has immunoglobulin (Ig) like fold whereas the C-terminal  domain  has  β-barrel  fold  (residues,  130-222).
The highly flexible region 98-108 corresponds to region 122-132 on the protein sequence, since region 1-25 of the protein was excluded from the crystal structure as it corresponds to a signal peptide.
We further characterized the full-length 179-residue protein and show that the polypeptide segments of residues 1 to 12 and 129 to 179 are flexibly disordered.
However, the presence of flexibly disordered regions in the protein identified by 1H NMR spectroscopy (see “Characterization of the full-length SARS-CoV nsp1” below) was consistent with the results of secondary structure prediction, which indicated that a few residues at the N terminus, as well as a greater number of residues in the C-terminal one-third of the protein, would not adopt regular secondary structure.
The structure of intact nsp1 includes a globular domain of residues 13 to 121 and the disordered regions of residues 1 to 12 and 122 to 179 (Fig. 1b).
Most of the resonances in full-length nsp1 that are not present in nsp1(13-128) have either small positive or negative 15N{1H} NOEs (Fig. 5c), showing that the polypeptide segments of residues 1 to 12 and 129 to 179 are best described as a short N-terminal and a long C-terminal flexibly disordered tail, respectively (Fig. ​1b).

Increased flexibility of the polypeptide chain that causes reduced NOE intensities is found in the disordered loop between residues 75 and 87 and in the region of residues 94 to 103, which forms nonregular secondary structure with one γ-turn of residues 97 to 99 and a type II β-turn of residues 98 to 101 ​(Fig.1). 
Unstructured region belonging to the Papain-like proteinase (PL-PRO)
In addition, the α1′-helix of nsp10 was completely density-untraceable in our structure, which can be clearly observed in both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV nsp10 (Fig. ​(Fig.1b1b).

The protruding, exiting RNA duplex is flanked by long α-helical extensions that are formed by the highly conserved17 N-terminal regions in the two nsp8 subunits (Figs. 2, 3). These prominent nsp8 extensions reach up to 28 base pairs away from the active site and use positively charged residues that are positioned to interact with the RNA backbones (Fig. 3).
The two nsp8 extensions differ with respect to their RNA interactions, which also argues for sequence-independent binding. The two nsp8 copies adopt different structures in the RdRp complex, and interact differently with nsp7 and nsp12 subdomains (Extended Data Fig. 3c). The nsp8 extensions also adopt different structures in crystals of nsp8–nsp7 complexes17,18, and are mobile in free RdRp15,16. This indicates that the nsp8 extensions are flexible in the RdRp complex and become ordered when an RNA duplex exits the enzyme.
The defined binding region mainly composed by positively charged residues relies on examining the reported cryo-EM structure attached to the publication along with Figure 3.

This may correspond to the flexibly disposed N-terminal domain of Nsp1 considering the 20-amino acid unstructured linker between the N- and C-terminal domains (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 1).
The C-terminal domain of Nsp1 binds to the mRNA entry site of 40S (red), while the N-terminal domain (gray) is flexibly disposed.
These results also agree with our structural findings that the C-terminal domain of Nsp1 is responsible for specific contacts with the ribosome, whereas the N-terminal domain is flexibly disposed.
This may correspond to the flexibly disposed N-terminal domain of Nsp1 considering the 20-amino acid unstructured linker between the N- and C-terminal domains (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 1).
Region 129-147 correspond to the flexible linker connecting the unstructured N-terminal domain of Nsp1 and its C-terminal domain, as also shown in Fig. 2e. 
The defined region relies on examining the missing coordinates in both reported X-ray structures attached to the publication (7C2J and 7C2I) and it is also missing in other unpublished structures of the Non-structural protein 10 (nsp10).
The region is disordered based upon Fig.2.
Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to monitor the conformational dynamics of NSP6 (91–112). In physiological pH buffer conditions, the peptide showed strong negative ellipticity at 198 nm, characteristic of random coil conformations (Fig. 4A).
Interestingly, in the presence of organic solvent (TFE) and SDS, peptide showed negative ellipticity at 208 nm and 222 nm, which showed a gain in the helical conformation of peptide (Fig. 4B & C). The results showed that the surrounding environment has a strong role in conformational dynamics of NSP6 91–112 region. Organic solvent and SDS are well-acknowledged for their hydrophobic and biological membrane mimic properties, respectively
to see the impact of membrane-mediated environment on the NSP6 91–112 region, we have used DOPS liposome. The NSP6 91–112 region acquires partial helical conformation in the presence of DOPS (Fig. 4D).
we have used the intrinsic tryptophan present in this peptide as a fluorescence probe to monitor the tertiary structure changes in the presence of SDS and TFE (Fig. 4E & F). Trp in the presence of non-polar/hydrophobic environment gives rise to a significant blue shift [33]. Furthermore, we have observed that in the presence of TFE and SDS peptide showed blue shift, which again confirms the tertiary structural changes are happening to the peptide in these conditions and following the results obtained from the CD spectroscopy.
In the presence of SDS (E) and TFE (F) peptide showed significant blue shift under the influence of hydrophobic environment.

The far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of Nsp1-CT features a negative ellipticity minimum at 200 nm and a negative ellipticity shoulder near 230 nm (Figure S1). The molar ellipticity minimum at 200 nm is about 40% of that expected for a random coil, suggesting an offsetting positive contribution from β-sheet or turn structures. (23) Decomposition of the spectrum into three components (α-helix, β-sheet, and random coil) indicates that the peptide adopts a dominant random coil configuration with an admixture of β-sheet and minimal (<5%) α-helix.
Employing laser spectroscopy, including time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET), we have obtained nanosecond snapshots of rapidly fluctuating conformations in the Nsp1 C-terminal peptide (Nsp1-CT).
Nsp1-CT W161 fluorescence is sensitive to low concentrations of Cu(II). At 30 μM peptide concentration, addition of 1 mol equiv of aquo Cu(II) leads to an ∼25% reduction in W161 fluorescence intensity. Cu(II) also produces a systematic reduction in the effective W161 fluorescence lifetime. Treating the reduction in ⟨τ⟩ with a single Cu-binding-site model leads to a dissociation constant of 9.7 μM (pH 6.5) (Figure 3). *W161 fluorescence in an Nsp1 variant in which H165 is replaced by alanine (Nsp1-CT(H165A)) is only weakly quenched by Cu(II) with an apparent dissociation constant of 106 μM (Figure S2). This result is consistent with the relative Cu(II) binding constants of imidazole (104.02 M–1) and a carboxylate (acetate, 101.82 M–1). (16) Importantly, the *W161 quenching data clearly implicate H165 as the site of Cu(II) coordination to Nsp1-CT.

In addition, no electron density is associated with the following surface residues: 18–19, 135–160 and 272–273 in molecule A, 138–152, 244–245 and 271–272 in molecule B, 138–161 and 247–250 in molecule C, and 140–152, 243–249 and 271–272 in molecule D.
In the structure of the enzyme bound to its product, a long flexible loop (residues 115-126) is located away from the active site.
There is no density for residues 116-126 in subunits B, C and D, indicating that these residues are disordered.
Here, we report the solution structure of AcrIIA5, which features a novel α/β fold connected to an N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR).
Here, we show that AcrIIA5 adopts a novel α/β fold preceded by an intrinsically disordered region (IDR).
AcrIIA5 comprises seven β-strands and two α-helices, preceded by an extended N-terminal disordered region (Figure 1B).
We note that the N-terminal 22 residues of AcrIIA5 display largely disordered backbone conformations (Figure 2A).
In addition, the N-terminal tail region exhibited a narrow dispersion of backbone chemical shifts, which is typically observed in unfolded proteins (Supplementary Figure S1B).
Heteronuclear NOEs are sensitive to fast internal dynamics, and thus can discriminate flexible loop and tail regions from rigid secondary structures. Residues in the folded region of AcrIIA5 showed large 1H–15N heteronuclear NOE values (>0.8), whereas the N-terminal disordered region exhibited significantly reduced NOE values (<0.6), a signature of conformational flexibility (Figure 2B).
AcrIIA5 is unique among known Acr proteins in that it contains a long unstructured tail region at the N-terminus. The 22-residue tail also possesses an amino acid composition biased toward disorder, including three lysine, four arginine, and four serine residues
Remarkably, truncation of the N-terminal IDR abrogates the inhibitory activity against Cas9, revealing that the IDR is essential for Cas9 inhibition by AcrIIA5.
N-terminal disorder is essential for Cas9 inhibition by AcrIIA5
We employed the N-terminal truncated AcrIIA5Δ20 to examine whether the IDR was dispensable for Cas9 inhibition by AcrIIA5. Remarkably, AcrIIA5Δ20 completely lost its ability to inhibit Cas9, revealing that the N-terminal disordered region is essential for Acr activity (Figure 3C).
Truncation of the first 5 N-terminal residues (AcrIIA5Δ5) showed a ∼40% reduction of Cas9 inhibition, and further truncations abolished the Acr activity (Figure 3E). Thus, the length of the IDR was important for Cas9 inhibition of AcrIIA5, such that an IDR length of >20 residues was required to maintain the maximal inhibitory activity against Cas9.
The IDR peptide alone (residues 1–20) failed to show any inhibitory activity against Cas9, indicating that the IDR functions in Cas9 inhibition only in concert with the folded region of AcrIIA5 (Figure 3G).
Taken together, the Cas9 inhibition of AcrIIA5 requires an IDR sequence that is covalently linked to the structured region.
Specifically, the length of the IDR provides a scaffold for association between AcrIIA5 and Cas9–sgRNA, while the positive charges of the IDR serve as a regulatory switch that hinders Cas9 function upon binding.
The IDR mediates direct interaction between AcrIIA5 and Cas9–sgRNA
Taken together, AcrIIA5 selectively binds to sgRNA-loaded Cas9 and inhibits the nuclease activity without competing with target DNA binding, which is unique among Cas9 inhibitors.
The size and sequence of the IDR modulate AcrIIA5 binding to Cas9 and inhibition of the nuclease activity.
The final model of the native structure contains residues 28–241 and misses residues 1–27, 66–67, 95, and 218–225 due to the lack of electron density. Two regions (residues 1–26 and 95–98) are disordered in the structure of the SpvC/phosphopeptide complex.
The N-terminal 26 residues are disordered in both the native SpvC structure and its complex with the peptide substrate (Figures 2A and 2B).
Mapping of the changes in the chemical shift onto the three-dimensional structure showed that the most perturbed residues are localized at three sites: the NH2-terminal unstructured region (site 1), the solvent-exposed surface of the first helix (site 2), and the region around loop 1 (loop connecting helices 1 and 2) and loop 3 (loop connecting helices 3 and 4) and helix 4 (site 3) (Fig. 2, A and B).
Results suggest that site 1, the NH2-terminal unstructured region, was necessary for binding and adopted a specific conformation upon binding to PtdIns(4,5)P2.
Many residues in site 1 showed large chemical shift changes, suggesting a large structural change upon phosphoinositide binding (Fig. 2A). Deletion of the entire site 1 region (NH2-terminal, 18 residues) resulted in a complete loss of PtdIns(4,5)P2binding (Fig. 2F).

The crystallised tPPADWT and tPPADC351A constructs include residues aa464–484, with no visible electron density.
The crystallised tPPADWT and tPPADC351A constructs include residues aa464–484, with no visible electron density. This region represents a flexible linker connecting the IgLF and CTD in the full-length polypeptide, and its flexibility likely caused disorder in the crystal.
Whereas the construct used for crystallization contained the entire 280 amino acid sequence, the first 22 amino acids at the N-terminus and the last three at the C-terminus are disordered in the crystal.
Two loops comprising residues 122 to 136 and 161 to 169, were disordered and therefore not included in the structure.
Residues 326–344 could not be located because of weak electron density, and in the crystal cannot adopt the conformation of the corresponding region of apo ecMSA (residues 329–346) as they would clash with a symmetry mate.
Electron density corresponding to the N-terminal domain was not visible suggesting that it is disordered.
The low complexity N-terminal regions (residues up to and including Asn41 of chain A, and Ala40 of chain B) were not visible in the electron density maps. These residues were assumed, therefore, to be disordered.
The Vap proteins of R. equi consist of β-barrel domains with disordered regions at their N-termini.
Several breaks occur in the main-chain tracing of all three domains as a result of absent or poorly defined electron density; these regions correspond to 15% of the polypeptide chain (fig. S2). Of particular note, no electron density was present for the 40-residue segment 295 to 334 in domain II, showing that this region is disordered or mobile. We refer to this region as the domain II loop.
The defined region relies on examining the missing coordinates in both reported X-ray structures attached to the publication (1w8k and 1w81), therefore the exact boundaries might be slightly different from the ones reported in the paper.

The first 17 residues from the N terminus appear unstructured and solvent-exposed.
The unstructured N-terminal region of FCaBP suggests that its covalently attached myristoyl group at the N terminus may be solvent-exposed, in contrast to the highly sequestered myristoyl group seen in recoverin and GCAP1. NMR analysis demonstrates that the myristoyl group attached to FCaBP is indeed solvent-exposed in both the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound states, and myristoylation has no effect on protein structure and folding stability.
In each crystal form, the first 17 residues from the N terminus appear disordered.
High temperature factors for the N-terminal residues suggest they may be dynamically disordered.
NMR relaxation studies and heteronuclear 15N nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) analysis on FCaBP also confirms that the first 17 N-terminal residues are indeed unstructured (data not shown) and the N-terminal myristoyl group is solvent-exposed (see below). 
The absence of detectable electron density from the first 17 residues of FCaBP suggested that the N-terminal region and myristoyl group may be structurally disordered.
The region defined here is based on the missing residues in the PDB structure 2j5l, with removing the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic regions based on UniProt entry P50490. 
Although the complete recombinant PvAMA1 ectoplasmic region (residues 43–487) and domains II and III of PfAMA1 (residues 303 to 544) were complexed with Fab F8.12.19 in the protein preparations used for crystallisation, only a small but contiguous segment of domain III from these two homologues could be identified in the electron density: the 34-residue segment from Ile421 to Lys454 in PvAMA1 and the equivalent 34-residue segment from Ile479 to Arg512 in PfAMA1 (Figure 4). This part of the antigen could be identified readily in the electron density by the cystine knot formed with Cys432-Cys449 and Cys434-Cys451 in PvAMA1 and Cys490-Cys507 and Cys492-Cys509 in PfAMA1. Additional electron density, observed in the final difference maps of both PvAMA1 and PfAMA1, did not coincide with the complete, superimposed PvAMA1 structure (PDB entry 1W8K) (Figure 5). This region is connected to modelled part of the antigen via the Cys388-Cys444 bridge in PvAMA1 (443Cys-502Cys in PfAMA1) but the electron density was too disordered to propose an unambiguous interpretation. No other region of significant electron density occurred in the maps.

The region defined here is based on the missing residues in the PDB structure 2j5l, taking into consideration the ordered domain from the same protein described in PDB structure 4r1a.
1H-NMR spectroscopy revealed the presence of a flexible and unstructured C-terminal extension, 12 amino acids in length, which protrudes from the domain core of 14-3-3ζ and is similar in structure and length to the C-terminal extension of mammalian sHsps. The extension stabilizes 14-3-3ζ
It has been proposed that the C-terminus of 14-3-3ζ (Asp231–Asn245) adopts a poorly ordered conformation
Taken together these results indicated that the strongest cross-peaks in the two-dimensional NMR spectra of full-length 14-3-3ζ were attributable to the 12 amino acid residues at the extreme C-terminus of the 14-3-3ζ dimer (i.e. from Gly234 to Asn245), with no cross-peaks being observed for residues preceding Gly234
thus 14-3-3ζ has a flexible C-terminal extension encompassing its last 12 amino acids that is directly comparable with the C-terminal extension of mammalian sHsps in terms of its polar nature and conformational flexibility
Consistent with folding prediction algorithms, the NMR data indicate that the last 12 C-terminal amino acids of 14-3-3ζ (Gly234–Asp245) are solvent-exposed and exhibit flexibility that is independent of the domain core of the protein, while adopting no preferred secondary structure
Therefore it is concluded that 14-3-3ζ, and by analogy all other 14-3-3 proteins, have a flexible C-terminal extension.
We were able to model most of PANX1 except for the linker connecting the intracellular helices IH1 and IH2 (residues 163–190), and the CTT (residues 374–426).
The disordered IH1–IH2 linker (residues 163–190) and the CTT (residues after 373) are indicated by dashed lines

The PANX1 channel forms a heptamer that contains (from top to bottom) an extracellular domain (ECD), a transmembrane domain (TMD) and an intracellular domain (ICD), with the unstructured CTT blocking the ICD entrance to the ion pathway along the symmetry axis (referred to as the main pore) (Fig. 1a, b).
Although we were unable to model the CTT owing to its intrinsically disordered nature, we have defined its key role in caspase-dependent channel gating (see ‘Ion pathways and channel gating’).
Instead, we observed that the intracellular entry was blocked by the unstructured CTT, and this blockage was released upon removal of the CTT by caspase 7, opening the main pore (Fig. 1c).
Under normal physiological conditions, the intracellular entrance of the main pore is blocked by the unstructured CTT, so anions—but not ATP—can move through the side tunnels, which explains why PANX1 currents can be evoked with a voltage clamp, during which there is no ATP release
The primary structure of AIP56 suggests that this toxin comprises two functional domains and could be an A-B toxin with its two moieties linked by a single disulphide bond (Figure S1) [23]. Therefore, in order to define domain boundaries within the toxin, limited proteolysis experiments were performed. SDS-PAGE analysis of AIP56 digested with chymotrypsin, trypsin or proteinase K revealed that the toxin is highly resistant to trypsin digestion, whereas chymotrypsin and proteinase K cleaved AIP56 into two major fragments with approximately 32 and 24 kDa (Figure 2A). These two fragments were only detected upon treatment with the reducing agent DTT, suggesting that they are linked by a disulphide bridge (Figure 2B). N-terminal Edman sequencing revealed that chymotrypsin cleavage occurred between Phe285 and Phe286, in the amino-acid stretch flanked by the two unique cysteine residues (Cys262 and Cys298) of AIP56 (Figure 2C). Altogether, these results indicate that AIP56 is composed of two domains linked by a disulphide bridge.
The region described in the publication, spanning residues Cys262 to Cys298, corresponds to region Cys278-Cys314 of the associated UniProt sequence as AIP56 was synthesized as a precursor protein with a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide that was removed during secretion, originating a 497-amino acid mature toxin.

AIP56 toxicity requires integrity of the linker but the disulfide bridge is dispensable for intoxication.

Translocation of AIP56 requires integrity of the Cys262-Cys298 linker but the disulphide bridge is not an absolute requirement for toxicity
These results suggest that the integrity of the linker region between the two cysteine residues is needed for toxin internalization, in contrast to what is known for the diphtheria, tetanus and botulinum toxins, where nicking of the inter-cysteine loop is required for toxicity
In contrast, we have found that the AIP56 N-terminal metalloprotease can only act when linked to a C-terminal binding domain that, by analogy with other A-B toxins, may assist the protease domain in its membrane translocation into the cytosol

However, another CD analysis (supplemental Fig. S6C) indicated that the 30-residue HP0895Ctp is unstructured.
In contrast, the unstructured C-terminal region of HP0895 was responsible for binding to HP0894 and underwent a conformational change in the process.
Based on these results, and to confirm the binding of this C-terminal region of HP0895 with HP0894, we synthesized a 30-residue peptide, HP0895Ctp (Val96–Ser125), corresponding to the C-terminal region of HP0895 and investigated the interaction between this peptide and HP0894. A series of two-dimensional [1H-15N] TROSY spectra of 15N-labeled HP0894 was recorded with successive additions of unlabeled HP0895Ctp (0, 0.5, 1, and 2 molar equivalents). As shown in Fig. 2C, obvious chemical shift changes in the slow exchange mode on the NMR time scale were observed for a lot of the residues of HP0894, and some other residues showed chemical shift changes in fast exchange mode. Chemical shift changes from the residues in the slow exchange mode were completed with equimolar HP0895Ctp, whereas fast exchange mode chemical shift changes continued above 1:1 molar ratio in an HP0895Ctp concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate that the dissociation constants (Kd) of HP0895Ctp (and consequently HP0895) with HP0894 are relatively small (∼10−8 m or smaller) (27). Thus, HP0894-HP0895 binding is strong. In addition, these results confirmed that HP0895 binds to HP0894 via its C-terminal region with a binding stoichiometry of 1:1.
Our results show that the cellular level functioning of HP0894 is inactivated by binding with HP0895. The direct interaction of these two proteins occurs mainly between the 30-residue C-terminal tail of HP0895 and the N-terminal secondary structure elements and an adjacent C-terminal β-strand of HP0894. Upon binding to HP0894, that unstructured C terminus tail of HP0895 seems to be transformed into structured form.
Taken together, it is concluded that the HP0894-HP0895 protein couple is a TA system in H. pylori, where HP0894 is a toxin with an RNase function, whereas HP0895 is an antitoxin functioning by binding to both the toxin and DNA.
In contrast, the unstructured C-terminal region of HP0895 was responsible for binding to HP0894 and underwent a conformational change in the process.
Thus, the unstructured HP0895 C-terminal region transforms into a structured form upon binding to HP0894. Furthermore, far-UV CD titrations of HP0894 with HP0895ctp yield a 1:1 stoichiometry with Kd of ∼10−8 M

HP0894 has RNase activity on mRNA, and HP0895 inhibits the decay of mRNA by HP0894. Moreover, HP0894 expression has a toxic effect on E. coli cell growth, but the co-expression of HP0895 neutralizes that HP0894 toxicity.

The following part (Arg43 to Arg65) is largely unstructured as evidenced by random CSI values and low heteronuclei (1H–15N) nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) values (Fig. S2d and e).
In summary, antitoxin RelB possesses a well-folded core domain (Met1–Glu42) at its N-terminus followed by a flexible region (Arg43–Leu79) at its C-terminus, a modular pattern typical of many other antitoxins.
To determine the region within RelB that is responsible for RelB−RelE interaction and antitoxic activity, full-length RelB (RelB1-79) and two N-terminus-truncated antitoxin sequences (RelB36-79 and RelB52-79) were coexpressed with RelE toxin in a single operon using the pBAD promoter control. E. coli strain TOP10 cells, carrying the plasmids, were grown in LB medium, and 0.2% arabinose was added at time zero. The growth rate observed for RelB36-79:RelE- or RelB52-79:RelE-expressing bacteria was indifferent from that of the full-length-RelB:RelE-expressing bacteria (Figure 6A). As a positive control, expression of the RelE toxin using the same pBAD system led to significant growth arrest. The result suggests that RelB interacts and neutralizes RelE toxicity via its C-terminal region. The exact binding domain should be therefore located in the last 28 residues of RelB.
We showed evidence that (i) RelB possesses a high content of α-helical and flexible regions and exhibits a conformationally induced fit upon toxin binding, as many proteins featuring disordered regions do, (ii) RelE is a well-folded protein, displaying a high content of antiparallel β-sheets and β-turns, (iii) RelB, RelE, and the RelBE complex display considerably different thermodynamic stabilities that most likely serve as an important functional basis that regulates the activity of the system under different conditions, (iv) the C-terminal part of RelB is responsible for RelB−RelE interaction, and (iv) the C-terminal part of RelB is likely to be unfolded due to high sensitivity to protease activity and this part interacts with RelE to become more resistant to degradation.
The RelE and RelB proteins constitute the RNA interferase (toxin) and its cognate inhibitor (antitoxin) components of the Escherichia coli relBE toxin−antitoxin system.

A 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N,13C-labeled RelBC alone displays poor dispersion of NH resonance (7.9-8.5 ppm), indicating that this C-terminal region of RelB is largely unstructured in its free state (Fig. 2B).
Titration of labeled RelBC with unlabeled RelER81A/R83A shows dramatic chemical shift changes in a similar slow exchange regime (Fig. 2, B and D). The well dispersed spectrum of RelBC in the bound state suggests that RelER81A/R83A binding induces the folding of RelBC.
The chemical shift index analysis (30) of RelBC peptide in both free and bound states revealed a disordered-to-ordered conformation change upon the complex formation (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B).

The chemical shift index analysis (30) of RelBC peptide in both free and bound states revealed a disordered-to-ordered conformation change upon the complex formation (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B).
The residual activity of RelER81A/R83A is completely abolished by the addition of the C-terminal domain of RelB antitoxin, RelBC (residues Lys47 to Leu79) (Fig. 1, A-C).
Our structures indicate that RelB counteracts the toxic activity of RelE by displacing alpha4 helix from the catalytically competent position found in the free RelE structure.
The apparent melting temperature of RelBC was estimated to be below 10 °C (Fig. 1b). In summary, antitoxin RelB possesses a well-folded core domain (Met1–Glu42) at its N-terminus followed by a flexible region (Arg43–Leu79) at its C-terminus, a modular pattern typical of many other antitoxins.
Firstly, size-exclusion analysis of RelB (9.38 kDa) yielded an apparent molecular mass (66.9 kDa) that is significantly larger than that of a dimer (as exhibited by many other antitoxin dimers) and closer to that of a septamer. Since the determination of molecular mass by SEC is related to the shape of the molecule, it is less accurate with nonglobular proteins. It is likely that the SEC method overestimates the size of RelB because the unstructured C-terminal region does not fold into a compact globular conformation.
Analysis of chemical shifts and steady state heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) patterns indicated that melittin is unstructured without TFE, but assumes stable helical conformation above a certain TFE concentration threshold.
The 15N-HSQC spectrum of melittin in aqueous solution at pH 7.0 without TFE (Figure 2B) showed a limited chemical shift dispersion along the 1H dimension indicative of an unstructured form.
It is known that melittin is unstructured at low concentrations in aqueous solutions, and more structured when bound to lipids, cell-surface GAGs, and proteins.
At 30% TFE (Figure 4B), there is an overall reduction in flexibility manifested by the higher positive heteronuclear NOEs. In general, the trans conformer was less flexible than the cis, and the difference is more pronounced for residues 15-17, and 19-21. The trans conformer has large positive heteronuclear NOEs (0.57 - 0.94 for residues 4-24) throughout the chain, and this is consistent with the formation of stable helices.
We identified the amino acids in melittinimportant for binding to HAA by saturation-transfer difference (STD) nuclearmagnetic resonance (NMR) experiments, and analysis of NMR line broadening upon titration of melittin with HAA. Our results suggest that hydrophobic resi-dues Ile17 and Ile20 on the C-terminal region of melittin are in close contactwith HAA in the melittin-HAA complex.
The melittin residues that showed the highest signal broadening upon addition of HAA were Ile17, and Ile20, with above 60% decrease in peak intensity (Figure 2). Next to these are Leu13, Ala15, Leu16, Ser18, and Trp19, which showed at least 50% decrease in peak amplitude. It is important to note that most of these residues have hydrophobic side chains, thus suggesting that hydrophobic interaction between HAA and melittin drives the binding event, consistent with our ITC findings.
We characterized the thermodynamic parameters of the binding process between melittin and HAA through isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and found the binding tobe endothermic and entropy-driven.
To assess the functional role of the positive (K21RKR24) sequence in the C-terminus of melittin, we designed a negatively charged melittin peptide (D21EDE24-melittin). These negative residues were predicted to disrupt the binding of melittin with the plasma membrane.
These data demonstrate that residues required for melittin activity include those residing in the C-terminal α-helix, comprising several key positively charged residues necessary for interaction with the plasma membrane.

Honeybee venom and melittin suppress the activation of EGFR and HER2 by interfering with the phosphorylation of these receptors in the plasma membrane of breast carcinoma cells.
Honeybee venom and melittin suppress the phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2.
Here, we show that honeybee venom and melittin suppress the ligand-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2, dynamically modulating downstream signaling pathways in breast cancer cells.
The N-terminal BRCT domain of BP1 contains a unique large insertion of 29 residues (1741-1769) rich in polar and charged residues between b1 and a1 that are not found in BRCA1 or other BRCTs. In our structure, this region is very disordered, probably indicating that it is highly fexible. However, in the first copy of BP1, some broken electron density is interpretable for residues 1741-1750 and there is good indication from model
building that these residues form an a-helical structure (a-I) that extends from the surface of the N-terminal BRCT domain into the solvent (Figure 1).
An N-terminal fragment (residues 1702–1713) and the region between β1A and α1A (residues 1741–1769) do not have interpretable electron density, and we presume are disordered. Residues 1741–1769 correspond to a 29 amino acid insertion that is not found in other BRCT repeats and is rich in polar and charged residues.

The residues invisible in electron density are indicated by gray shading
The residues Met1 to Leu16 and Tyr124 to Pro147 in HIba1, and Met1 to Leu16 and Asn128 to Pro147 inMIba1 were invisible in the final electron density map, as indicated by gray in Figure1
The mass spectrum of purified samples showed that there are truncated proteins with molecular masses of 13,234 Da for H-Iba1 (VM=1.82 Å3/Da) and 14,486 Da for M-Iba1 (VM=1.92 Å3/Da), respectively, suggesting that from eight to 13 amino acid residues are possibly disorderd in crystals

Two regions are dynamically disordered as evidenced by 1H and 13C chemical shifts and {15N}-1H NOEs: residues 1–9 of the amino terminus and residues 69-93 of the C-terminal extension.
A steady decline is seen in the heteronuclear NOE values for the unstructured residues approaching the ends of the N- and C-termini with negative NOE values observed for residues near each terminus; these values are consistent with large-amplitude motions on the picosecond to nanosecond time scale and a complete lack of stable secondary or tertiary structure.
No long-range NOEs were observed for the 9 N-terminal and 26 C-terminal residues.
Residues 1–8 and 69–93 are highly disordered.
Residues comprising the unique C-terminal sequence of hLtn are entirely disordered in solution (Figures 4 and 5), but residues 9–68 adopt the conserved fold observed for all other chemokines (Figure 6).
The IDR characterized in the publication and spanning residues 69-93 corresponds to region 90-114 of the amino acid sequence, since the natural precursor form of the protein contains a signal peptide (1-21) that is cleaved in the mature secreted protein.

The C-terminal α-helix observed at 10 °C and 200 mM NaCl, which is conserved in other chemokines, is absent at 45 °C and no salt, and the last 38 residues of the protein are completely disordered, as indicated by heteronuclear 15N-1H NOEs. 
Under these conditions, hLtn adopted the conserved chemokine fold consisting of three antiparallel β-strands and a C-terminal α-helix with unstructured N- (1–9) and C-terminal (69–93) residues.
The IDR characterized in the publication and spanning residues 76-93 corresponds to region 97-114  of the amino acid sequence, since the the Ltn expression construct described in the paper lacks the N-terminal Val-1 residue and the resulting protein therefore corresponds to Ltn (2–93). In addition the natural precursor form of the protein contains a signal peptide (1-21) that is cleaved in the mature secreted protein.
Completely disordered residues 76–93 were not included in water refinement calculations, thus the ensemble of CC3 NMR structures deposited in the PDB contains only residues 1–75.
Backbone r.m.s.d. (Figure 3B) and 15N-1H heteronuclear NOE (Figure 3C) values confirm that residues 1–10 and 69–93 are dynamically disordered in solution, as observed with the Ltn10 structure (4). 
The IDR characterized in the publication and spanning residues 61-93 corresponds to region 82-114 of the amino acid sequence, since the natural precursor form of the protein contains a signal peptide (1-21) that is cleaved in the mature secreted protein.
Disordered N- and C-terminal residues (residues 1–7 and 53–93) are not shown.
Completely disordered residues 61–93 were not included in water refinement calculations, thus the ensemble of Ltn40 NMR structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank contains only residues 1–60. NMR structure refinement statistics are provided in Table S1.
Only residues 7–490 could be traced; 5 amino acids at the N terminus, the 13C-terminal residues, and the polyhistidine tag are not visible in the electron density map because of structural flexibility.
Fitting of the RbcL8 core from the crystal structure showed that density accommodating the ∼60 C-terminal residues (residues 413–475) of the RbcL subunits was missing in the cryo-EM density map (Fig. 3c, d), indicating that this segment is disordered.
Residues 413 and 475 correspond to residues 410 and 472 (respectively) in the Uniprot and PDB associated sequences.
On RbcX2 binding, the previously ‘free’ C-terminal segment of RbcL seems to be pulled back towards the main body of the subunit and becomes tethered via the interaction of the ultimate C terminus with the central crevice of RbcX2. This RbcX2-mediated ordering of the RbcL C termini may also provide a platform for RbcS docking.

These interactions with RbcX2 may exert a stabilizing effect on the N-terminal domain, as indicated by the partial protease protection of the N-terminal ∼60 residues of RbcL by RbcX2 (data not shown).
Raf1 fulfills a role similar to that of the assembly chaperone RbcX, thus suggesting that functionally redundant factors ensure efficient Rubisco biogenesis.
The resulting tentative model for the RbcL8–Raf14 complex (Fig. 5g,h) is consistent with a role of Raf1 in stabilizing RbcL2 and allowing its assembly into the RbcL8 core complex.
 Thus, it seems plausible that the C-terminal residues of RbcL are also ordered in the complex with Raf1
To elucidate how Raf1 mediates Rubisco assembly, we obtained a higher-resolution structure of the Syn7942 RbcL-Raf1 supercomplex expressed in Escherichia coli using cryo-EM (SI Appendix, Fig. S2).
"This movement could in turn destabilize the interaction of the RbcL C terminus with RbcX2, thus triggering RbcX2 release and final maturation of the Rubisco holoenzyme."

Binding of Syn6301-RbcX2(FLAG), AnaCA-RbcX2(FLAG) and Syn7002-RbcX2 to an array of dodecapeptides, with a 10 residue overlap, covering the sequence of the last 40 amino-acids of Syn7002-RbcL, Syn6301-RbcL and Ana7120-RbcL (shown on top)
The consensus motif for RbcX2 binding inferred by this analysis corresponds to residues 461 to 466 (EIKFEF).

The consensus motif for RbcX2 binding inferred by this analysis corresponds to residues 461 to 466 (EIKFEF).
Isothermal titration calorimetry confirmed that Syn6301-RbcX2 bound the C-terminal sequence of RbcL (KEIKFEFETMD) with low affinity (Kd ∼105 µM) (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b).
Isothermal titration calorimetry confirmed that Syn6301-RbcX2 bound the C-terminal sequence of RbcL (KEIKFEFETMD) with low affinity (Kd ∼105 µM) (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b).
The C-terminal 12 residues were disordered in all
crystal lattices.
The Dmax of the full-length AtRaf1.2 dimer was ∼208 Å, and the radius of gyration (Rg) was 52 Å; we obtained similar values for Syn7942-Raf1. This suggested that the highly charged, flexible linker allows dynamic movements of the Raf1α domains relative to the β-domain dimer, as supported by an ensemble model of the AtRaf1.2 structure (Supplementary Fig. 3e).
The limits of the disordered region were further verified from the structural data on the domain limits and supported by MS analysis.
Missing electron density in the nucleotide-free state and in the VPS9a mutant (D185N) GDP-bound form.
Switch I of ARA7 (residues 32-44) in ARA7-GDP/VPS9a(D185N) is disordered and indicated as transparent green dots.

The far-UV CD spectra showed a strong negative absorbance at 200 nm for His6-HvNAC005(173–355), His6-HvNAC013(177–346), and HvNAC013(177–346) with little ellipticity around 220 nm indicating lack of a significant amount of secondary structure and highly characteristic of unstructured proteins (Figs. 6, A and B, and ​77B).
HvNAC005 correspond to Hordeum vulgare NAC domain-containing protein.
When adenine was added to the plates, both full-length HvNAC005, HvNAC005(1–355), and the HvNAC005 C-terminus, HvNAC005(172–355), were able to activate transcription of the reporter gene HIS3, as measured by the ability of transformed yeast to grow in the absence of histidine (Fig. 3B). By contrast and, as expected, the NAC domain, HvNAC005(1–172) alone was unable to activate transcription.
HvNAC005 correspond to Hordeum vulgare NAC domain-containing protein.
Removal of the SC- and the KR-motifs from both full-length and C-terminal HvNAC005 did not affect the ability to activate transcription (Fig. 3B). By contrast, removal of the LL-motif abolished activity in both cases. 
The region 172-250 corresponds to the shorter construct retaining the activator function.
The far-UV CD spectra showed a strong negative absorbance at 200 nm for His6-HvNAC005(173–355), His6-HvNAC013(177–346), and HvNAC013(177–346) with little ellipticity around 220 nm indicating lack of a significant amount of secondary structure and highly characteristic of unstructured proteins (Figs. 6, A and B, and ​77B).
HvNAC013 correspond to Hordeum vulgare NAC transcription factor.
This aspect of HvNAC013(177–346) was analyzed using size exclusion chromatography. The calculated molecular mass of HvNAC013(177–346) is 18.0 kDa, corresponding to a Stokes radius of 20.5 Å for a globular protein. However, HvNAC013(177–346) eluted in a volume corresponding to a molecular mass of 41.5 kDa and a Stokes radius of 28.01 Å (Fig. 6C). This suggested that HvNAC013(177–346) exists in a pre-molten globule-like state (Fig. 6C).
HvNAC013 correspond to Hordeum vulgare NAC transcription factor.
NMR experiments using 15N-labeled HvNAC013(177–346) were also performed to examine for both the secondary structure and oligomeric state of HvNAC013(177–346). The HSQC spectrum showed a clustering of signals with low dispersion in the proton dimension (Fig. 6D) suggesting that HvNAC013(177–346) is highly unfolded.
HvNAC013 correspond to Hordeum vulgare NAC transcription factor.
A directed yeast two-hybrid assay using full-length HvNAC013 and HvRCD1 as bait and prey, respectively, suggested that the proteins interacted (Fig. 8B). Similar results were obtained when HvRCD1 acted as bait and HvNAC013 as prey (Fig. 8C). Analysis of the ability of the isolated domains of HvNAC013 to interact with HvRCD1 showed that the interaction was mediated by the TRD of HvNAC013 (Fig. 8D). 
HvNAC013 correspond to Hordeum vulgare NAC transcription factor.
Recombinant versions of the HvNAC013 TRD and HvRCD1 RST domains, His6-HvNAC013(177–346) and GST-HvRCD1(485–579), were produced and used for in vitro pulldown assays (Fig. 8E). Western blot analysis showed that His6-HvNAC013(177–346) bound to immobilized GST-HvRCD1(485–579), but not to GST.
HvNAC013 correspond to Hordeum vulgare NAC transcription factor.
In contrast to full-length HvNAC013 and its TRD, HvNAC013(1–250), lacking the 96 C-terminal amino acid residues of HvNAC013, did not interact with HvRCD1. In contrast, mutation of the conserved aspartate (D217A) and leucine (L212A) of the LP motif had no effect on the interaction. In conclusion, the ability of the HvNAC013 TRD to interact with RCD1 resides within the 96 C-terminal amino acid residues of HvNAC013, and no interaction was detected between the LP motif
HvNAC013 correspond to Hordeum vulgare NAC transcription factor.
HvNAC013 interacted with barley radical-induced cell death 1 (RCD1) via the very C-terminal part of its TRD, outside of the region containing the LP motif. 
In conclusion, the ability of the HvNAC013 TRD to interact with RCD1 resides within the 96 C-terminal amino acid residues of HvNAC013.
The indispensability of the 96 C-terminal amino acid residues of HvNAC013 for the interaction with HvRCD1 together with the predicted structure for the last 24 residues of HvNAC013 (Fig. 4) may suggest that a MoRF is present in this part of HvNAC013 (6, 7).
HvNAC013 correspond to Hordeum vulgare NAC transcription factor.
Coding regions of HvNAC005 and HvNAC013 were fused to yeast GAL4 DBD (Fig. 5A) and analyzed for their ability to activate transcription and promote yeast growth in the absence of histidine and adenine. Murine tumor suppressor p53 (pVA3-1) and SV40 large antigen (pTD1-1) were included as positive controls for transformation and activity dependent selective growth (38). Full-length HvNAC013 was able to activate transcription, and the activation potential resided in the C terminus (residues 177–346), whereas the N-terminal NAC domain (residues 1–176) was unable to activate reporter genes (Fig. 5C).
HvNAC013 correspond to Hordeum vulgare NAC transcription factor.
The CD spectrum of interacting HvNAC013(177–346) and His6-HvRCD1(485–579) seemed to be dominated by the HvNAC013 structure (Fig. 9D). A change in absorbance at both 222 and 208 nm was observed for mixed compared with individual proteins suggesting a shift toward a more unfolded state or more extended structure within the complex (Fig. 9D). This is a strong indication that HvNAC013 and HvRCD1 do not interact through a coupled binding and folding mechanism, but rather through a slight reorientation of the conformational ensemble of either or both proteins, possibly involving extended structure formation.

Spectra of individual proteins and mixed HvNAC013(177–346) and His6-HvRCD1(485–579) were recorded (Fig. 9, A and B). The sum of the spectra of individual proteins was used as reference for noninteracting proteins. Δλmax was calculated and a minor change of 4.5 and 3.0 nm in fluorescence λmax upon mixing of the two proteins was observed from the excitation wavelengths. This suggested that the environment around the aromatic residues changed to more hydrophobic upon interaction (Fig. 9B).

The two linker regions on both sides of PHD finger that are connected to the BAH domain (residues 156–161 and 216–234) are disordered and were not built into the final model (Figure 1D).

Residues 115 to 134 were not resolved in any of the RbcX peptide chains.
Indeed, limited proteolysis of RbcX resulted in the removal of the poorly conserved 25 C-terminal residues (Figure S3), leaving a stable core domain of residues 1–109 (RbcX(ΔC25)) which was active in Rubisco assembly (Figure S4).

The PH domain is interconnected between α3S and α4S of the stalk by two disordered loops, L1SP and L2SP, and shows only minor deviations from the isolated PH domain of dynamin 1 (refs 14, 15; r.m.s.d. of 0.8 Å for 102 Cα atoms).
The IDR spanning residues 500-517 is a flexible linker connecting the Stalk in the middle domain (MD) and the PH domain as shown in Fig 1.

Based on our crystal structure, CCM2PTB comprises residues Ser60–Tyr221 with a 32-residue flexible loop (loop β6/β7) inserted between strands β6 and β7 (residues Asp160–Glu191), for which we do not observe density in any of the four copies of CCM2PTB
The long loop (residues 377–420) connecting CCM2cts and CCM2-chelix, and the remaining residues beyond α6, are omitted in the final model due to the lack of interpretable electron density, indicative of their high intrinsic flexibility.
In the AtKAT2inactive structure, this loop is largely disordered, with Met173–Lys184 not seen in the structure and residues Met168–Pro172 extending out toward where α-helix H1 in the L-domain is positioned in AtKAT2active. 
The enzyme consists of 462 residues and continuous density is observed for the main chain from residues 39 to 172 and from 185 to 440 in subunit A, and residues 39–176 and 184–441 in subunit B.
These are as follows: first, a short loop between α5 and β7 (residues 147–149), which is also poorly ordered in Steap3 (residues 157–162); second, the N-terminal 18 residues are also disordered.
The crystal asymmetric unit contains three A2 molecules that are essentially identical and comprise residues 1,478–1,674; we do not observe interpretable density for amino-terminal residues 1,478–1,493, most likely because of flexibility.
A large part of the N-terminus, including residues 196–221, is completely disordered, which was also observed in the homologous structure 1IO0
The first N-terminal 19 residues, Gly160–Pro178, do not give any clear electron density, and these are likely to be flexible and disordered.
Gly160 and Pro178 in this construct correspond to Gly146 and Pro164 in Tropomodulin real sequence.
In accordance with solution studies of E. coli DnaK [16] and the crystal structure of rat Hsc70 [14], the final 26 C terminal residues were found to be disordered

The domain was shown to be comprised of a rigid structure consisting of four helices and a flexible C-terminal subdomain of approximately 33 amino acids. The mobility of the flexible region is maintained in the context of the full-length protein and does not appear to be modulated by the nucleotide state.
In addition, the last 33 amino acids constitute a highly flexible subdomain of the molecule.
In contrast to the apparently rigid structure of the helical portion of the molecule, the carboxy-terminal 33 residues are highly flexible.
The remaining residues of the four molecules, A621–A646, B619–B646, C622–C646, and D615–D646, could not be traced due to their poor electron density maps.
The numbering of the IDR refers to chain C
The N terminus of the protein begins with 31 unobserved and presumably disordered residues, followed by a small subdomain that contains two helices
The final model includes residues 32–265 and residues 296–426 for subunit A, residues 40–265 and residues 296–426 for subunit B, one calcium ion for each subunit, and a total of 342 water molecules. Residues not included in the model are Caenorhabditis elegans: cloning, expression, purification, and those that are not visible and assumed to be disordered.
In addition, strands 10 and 11 are connected by a long stretch of sequence (residues 265– 296) that appears to extend away from the core structure. Since there is no electron density observed for this sequence, it is assumed to be disordered
The final model includes residues 32–265 and residues 296–426 for subunit A, residues 40–265 and residues 296–426 for subunit B, one calcium ion for each subunit, and a total of 342 water molecules. Residues not included in the model are Caenorhabditis elegans: cloning, expression, purification, and those that are not visible and assumed to be disordered.
The final model includes all of the HER-1GM sequence except 11 C-terminal residues (165–175) for which electron density was not interpretable.
Residues M1 to I105 and N621 to K733, which constitute most of the amino terminus and the distal C terminus beyond the CNBD, respectively, were not modelled because their densities were weak or missing.
The density of residues 1–105 was missing in the map
Residues M1 to I105 and N621 to K733, which constitute most of the amino terminus and the distal C terminus beyond the CNBD, respectively, were not modelled because their densities were weak or missing.
Residues 621–733 were not visible in the density map. There was weak density under the C-linker/CNBD region. This density could represent the coiled coil region, but it was too weak for model building.
Residues M1 to V103 (N terminus), G162 to L164, and D620 to K733 (distal C terminus) were not modeled because of weak or missing densities.
Residues M1 to V103 (N terminus), G162 to L164, and D620 to K733 (distal C terminus) were not modeled because of weak or missing densities.
The final crystallographic model encompasses residues 691–729 and 758–820, whereas a long insert (730–757) that is only found in Caenorhabditis LIN-41 protein sequences could not be built due to high flexibility.
The disordered sequence stretch 730–757 which is not included in the model is displayed as grey dots.
The C-terminal 25 residues are missing from all four molecules and are presumably disordered. Residues 120–129 have poor electron densities and are built in only one molecule

The N-terminus (1-29)
on both the subunits was not resolved in electron density
maps even after several rounds of refinement. 
Unexpectedly, although the N-terminus is disordered in previous DPOR L-protein structures (residues 1-29 in 3FWY and
residues 1-27 in 2YNM), we observe electron
density at the N-terminus of chain C in our
nucleotide-free structure, which we were able
to model as residues 16 to 29 (Supplemental
Fig. 1b).
Interestingly, in chain C, we observe
the flexible N-terminus bound across the
[4Fe-4S] cluster (Fig. 2a, dark blue) covering
a surface that is normally used to interface
with BchNB (Fig. 2c, purple).
The position and specific interactions of the N-terminal residues in our
nucleotide-free structure suggests a possible
auto-inhibitory role by forming a barrier to
docking and shielding the [4Fe-4S] cluster of
BchL.
The masking of the [4Fe-4S] cluster by the flexible N-terminal region and the
associated inhibition of activity is a novel
mechanism of regulation in metalloproteins.
Hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry shows that ATPbinding to BchL produces specific conformational changes leading to release of the flexible N-terminus from the docking interface. 
The HDX data suggest a direct path
of communication between the N-terminal
flexible region and the ATP binding pocket.
Perturbations in the N-terminal flexible region allosterically modulates changes in the
ATP-binding pocket (and vice versa).
We show that amino acid
substitutions within this flexible N-terminal
region enhance the kinetics of Pchlide reduction, pointing to a functionally auto-inhibitory role.
 Both BchLS17A and
BchL4A are active for Pchlide reduction and
show Chlide formation rates ~2 fold higher
than that of wild type BchL (kobs= 0.026 ±
0.002, 0.041 ± 0.008, and 0.045 ± 0.007 min1
for BchL, BchLS17A and BchL4A, respectively; Fig. 3b). 
The HDX data suggest a direct path of communication between the N-terminal flexible region and the ATP binding pocket. Perturbations in the N-terminal flexible region allosterically modulates changes in the ATP-binding pocket (and vice versa).
The HDX-MS data support an elegant
allosteric mechanism for the ATP-binding
driven release of autoinhibition, as helix 8
physically connects the DFD patch and the
flexible N-terminal region (Supplemental
Fig. 6b-c).
The map obtained showed clear electron density for most of the protein residues and the ABA–bound molecule, whereas no models were built for 12 N‐terminal and 5 C‐terminal residues, which were not observed in the electron density map.
Six regions of the polypeptide chain (residues 1–172, 186–190, 263–269, 297–306,

No density was visible for the rest of the linker and the MIT domain, consistent with their flexibility as previously shown (Zehr et al., 2017)." 
A disordered region outside the AAA core anchors katanin to the microtubule while the AAA motor exerts the forces that extract tubulin dimers and sever the microtubule
Thus, our structural and functional work reveals how tubulin tails template the assembly and ATPase activation of the katanin hexamer, and shows how katanin uses complex multivalent interactions with the microtubule through flexible and intrinsically disordered elements to generate the forces needed to extract tubulin subunits out of the microtubule
Our structural and functional work shows that katanin, unlike other AAA ATPases characterized so far, uses a double-spiral system to coordinate the tubulin tail through the central pore and multivalent contacts through a low complexity disordered region outside the ordered AAA core to anchor the enzyme to the microtubule
A Positively Charged Disordered Linker Region Is Critical for Severing
Mutation of the equivalent Ser to a phosphomimetic residue (Ser135Glu) in C. elegans katanin causes a ∼50% decrease in ATPase (Figure 5A) as well as microtubule severing and nanodamage activity (Figures 5B, 5D, 5E, and S7A). Thus, the introduction of negative charges in this linker region inhibits katanin
Our results indicate that both microtubule binding and mechanochemical coupling are impaired when positively charged residues are mutated in the linker, with K119 and K120 having the most drastic effect. Thus, elements outside the structured AAA and MIT domains are critical for severing
Our functional work reveals that clusters of positively charged residues in the disordered linker connecting the AAA and MIT domains are required for katanin microtubule binding and severing
High-affinity microtubule binding requires the disordered linker (Eckert et al., 2012, Jiang et al., 2017), consistent with our finding that positively charged linker residues are critical for katanin severing
in the electron density map, two regions near the N terminus (residues 1–8 and 26–37) are not resolved. Both of these disordered segments are located on the periphery of the structure, whereas the inner core of the protein is reasonably well ordered.
The N-terminus (amino acids 1–39), C-terminus (amino acids 239–275), and a short cytoplasmic loop (amino acids 175–180) are either not observed or weakly resolved in the density map, presumably due to conformational differences between particles or because they are disordered.

The 3a N-terminus is involved in subcellular localization
These results are consistent with the N-terminal region of 3a being a determinant of its subcellular localization without influencing channel properties.
The N-terminal ~41 residues of each chain constitute the majority of the extracellularly or lumenally exposed 3a protein and thus could be involved in retention of 3a to internal membranes in cultured cells. To test this, we generated an N-terminal deletion construct lacking the first 41 amino acids (3aΔN) and compared its localization to wild-type 3a in HEK cells. Indeed, 3aΔN-EGFP shows reduced localization to internal membranes and bright foci and increased plasma membrane expression (Fig. 4A, S12). While we were unable to model the N-terminal 39 residues of 3a, we note an unassigned density feature in the cryo-EM maps that stretches between subunits just above the extracellular entrance to the pore that could correspond to a portion of these unmodeled N-terminal residues (Fig. 4B). We speculated that if the N-terminal region was stably positioned above the mouth of the pore it could influence channel properties.
Definition of a TRAF binding domain in ORF3a required for activation of NF-κB and IL-1β secretion.
A TRAF-binding motif, PLQAS, consistent with the consensus sequence PxQx(T/S/D) in which x could be any residue, was located at aa 36–40 of ORF3a. To define their necessity for the NF-κB- and inflammasome-activating activity of ORF3a, 3 point mutants designated M-T, M-I, and M-C were created to disrupt the TRAF binding, ion channel, and caveolin binding domains, respectively (Fig. 4A). In M-T, 3 conserved residues (P, Q, and S) in the TRAF-binding motif were changed into A. In M-I, 3 conserved C residues required for ion channel activity (14, 24) were changed into S. Finally, 3 conserved Y residues in the caveolin-binding motif were changed into A in M-C.
Interestingly, the M-C and M-I mutants were fully competent in the activation of NF-κB and the NLRP3 inflammasome (Fig. 4B, bars 5–8 vs. 3 and 4; Fig. 4C, lanes 2 and 3 vs. 1). In sharp contrast, the M-T mutant lost its ability to activate either IL-8–Luc or IL-1β secretion (Fig. 4B, bars 9 and 10 vs. 3 and 4; Fig. 4C, lane 4 vs. 1). In other words, TRAF binding was essential for NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation by ORF3a. Surprisingly, neither caveolin binding nor the ion channel was required for this activity.
When we immunoprecipitated TRAF2, 3, and 6 with an anti-FLAG antibody, ORF3a but not its M-T mutant was detected in the precipitate (Fig. 5A, lanes 1, 3, and 5 vs. 2, 4, and 6). These results indicated that ORF3a was capable of interacting with TRAF2, 3, and 6, but this ability was abrogated in the M-T mutant.
The TRAF binding domain is required for the association of ORF3a with TRAF2, 3, and 6 and ASC.

Although full-length Dcytb (residues 1–286) was used for crystallization, the atomic model includes only residues 6–230 because the electron density map for the five N-terminal residues and the 56 C-terminal residues was disordered.
In both molecules, and in spite of different packing contacts, 19 amino acids from the N–terminus and 24 from the C– terminus could not be traced, presumably due to conformational flexibility.

The region with missing residues in the PDB structure has a different numbering in UniProt and the publication, the region defined here follows the UniProt numbering.
The extended loop between helices α6 and α8 (Met160mCRY1 to Gly213mCRY1) is partly disordered in mCRY1 (missing residues 167 to 177 and 203/204), and the region between Cys178mCRY1 and α8 significantly differs from dCRY (Figure 3A). 
The full-length mCRY1 protein was spontaneously proteolysed to a mCRY1[1-497] fragment corresponding to the photolyase homology region (PHR).
The hydrodynamic (Stokes) radii determined by AUC analyses (Table 1) suggest that the mCRY and mBMAL1 proteins have somewhat elongated shapes and might be at least partially unstructured.
To quantify the contributions of the two mBMAL1 binding epitopes of mCRY1 and to find out which epitope is responsible for the different binding affinities of mCRY1 to mBMAL1-(577–625), mBMAL1-(490–625), and mBMAL1-(490–625)K537Q, we have synthesized peptides comprising mCRY1 residues Asn-472 to Ser-505 corresponding to the predicted coiled coil region (peptide P1) as well as residues Ser-564 to Glu-591 within the mCRY1 tail region (peptide P2). CD spectroscopy showed that peptide P1 has a high α-helical content (as predicted), whereas peptide P2 is mostly disordered (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S3B). 
To determine which mCRY residues are most critical for the mBMAL1 interaction, we have SPOT-synthesized peptides including the conserved mCRY coiled coil epitope (mCRY1 sequence 473HAEASRLNIERMKQIYQQLSRYRGLGLLASVP504) and the major part of the mCRY1 tail epitope (565QQTHSLKQGRSSAGTGLSSGKRPSQEEDAQS595). We have exchanged each amino acid in the mCRY peptides to alanine and measured the binding of the modified peptides to Cy3.5 fluorescently labeled mBMAL1-(577–625) (Fig. 4D). his experiment showed that single alanine mutations of the negatively charged residues Glu-590, Glu-591, or Asp-592 in the mCRY1 tail peptide raise its affinity to mBMAL1 drastically, whereas the exchange of any single lysine or arginine to alanine lowers it.

Peptide P2, however, binds to mBMAL1-(577–625) and to the mBMAL1-(490–625)K537Q mutant fragment with an affinity of ∼3 μm but to the wild-type mBMAL1-(490–625) fragment with a lower affinity of ∼8 μm (Table 3 and Fig. 5, B–D). In contrast to all other mCRY-mBMAL1 interactions that we have analyzed by ITC, the interaction of peptide P2 with mBMAL1-(490–625)K537Q is exothermic and enthalpically as well as entropically favored (Fig. 5D, Table 3). This indicates that the P2-mBMAL1-(490–625)K537Q complex involves a larger number of polar contacts (e.g. hydrogen bonds) than the other mCRY-BMAL1 interactions, which are entropically but not enthalpically favored (30).

We then determined the role of each LIR motif in degradation of CRY1 by expressing FLAG-tagged WT-CRY1 plasmid and each CRY1 mutant LIR plasmid (mLIR1, mLIR2, mLIR3, and mLIR4 as in Figure 5B) in liver via tail vein injections using the jet-PEI in vivo transfection system (Chang et al., 2014) (Figure S5A).
Strikingly, mLIR1-CRY1 and mLIR4-CRY1 accumulated significantly more than mLIR2-CRY1 and mLIR3-CRY1 or WT-CRY1. Levels of mLIR2 and mLIR3 CRY1 were moderately higher than WT-CRY1, but differences between these groups remained statistically insignificant (Figure 5C). These results indicate that LIR1 (271DLYKKV276) and LIR4 (492SRYRGL497) are required for degradation of CRY1
by autophagy. Accumulation of mLIR1-CRY1 and mLIR4-CRY1 did not occur from reduced autophagy per se, indicated by equivalent LC3-II flux in livers injected with WT or mLIR-CRY1 plasmids (Figure 5D), or from changes in transfection
determined by qPCR showing equivalent Cry1 expression in
livers injected with WT and mLIR-CRY1 plasmids (Figure S5E).
CoIP in 293T cells confirmed that interactions of mLIR1-CRY1
and mLIR4-CRY1 with GFP-tagged LC3 were remarkably
reduced compared with WT-CRY1, mLIR2-CRY1, or mLIR3-
CRY1 (Figure S5F). These results are consistent with significant
accumulation of mLIR1-CRY1 and mLIR4-CRY1 and moderate
accumulation of mLIR2 and mLIR3 CRY1 in liver compared
with WT-CRY1 (Figure 5C). Consistent with our observation that accumulation of CRY1 in Atg7KO mice associates with
decreased BMAL1 levels (Figure 2J), accumulation of mLIR1-
CRY1 or mLIR4-CRY1 each associated with reduced BMAL1
levels (Figure 5E), indicating that expressing autophagy-resistant
forms of CRY1 is sufficient to disrupt the liver clock.

LIR Motifs Link CRY1 Degradation to Regulation of Gluconeogenesis
Since increases in hepatocellular CRY1 protein inhibit gluconeo￾genesis, we next tested whether accumulation of mLIR1-CRY1 or mLIR4-CRY1 was sufficient to suppress hepatic glucose production/blood glucose levels. Indeed, mice injected with mLIR1-CRY1 or mLIR4-CRY1, but not mLIR2-CRY1 and mLIR3-CRY1 constructs, displayed reduced G6P protein levels (Figure 5F) and decreased blood glucose levels at 7 p.m. (Figures 5G–5J). Furthermore, mLIR1-CRY1- or mLIR4-CRY1-injected mice, and not the mLIR2-CRY1- and mLIR3-CRY1-injected mice, exhibited less glucose production when subjected to PTTs (Figure 5K), indicating that LIR motifs 271DLYKKV276 and 492SRYRGL497 link CRY1 turnover by autophagy to regulation
of gluconeogenesis. Most surprisingly, CRY1 LIR2 (285SLYGQL290) and LIR4 (492SRYRGL497) are also required for degradation of SCF components Skp1 and FBXL3 by autophagy, since livers injected with mLIR2-CRY1, mLIR3-CRY1, and
mLIR4-CRY1 each showed accumulation of these proteins compared with WT-CRY1 or mLIR1-CRY1 (Figure S5G). These data suggest that SCF components Skp1 and Fbxl3 are likely tar￾geted for autophagic degradation via their association with CRY1 (Xing et al., 2013), which, in turn, binds to LC3 via its LIR motifs.
In the article, the functional LIR motif YRGL in positions 494-497 corresponds to LIR4.

These data suggest that SCF components Skp1 and Fbxl3 are likely tar￾geted for autophagic degradation via their association with CRY1 (Xing et al., 2013), which, in turn, binds to LC3 via its LIR motifs.
In the article, the functional LIR motif YRGL in positions 494-497 corresponds to LIR4.
The non-functional LIR motif YQQL in positions 488-491, and the functional LIR motif YRGL in positions 494-497, are both incorporated inside the disordered region fragment in positions 471-606.

LIR motifs link CRY1 degradation to regulation of glucose homeostasis
LIR motifs on CRY1 determine their degradation and regulation of gluconeogenesis
Since increases in hepatocellular CRY1 protein inhibit gluconeogenesis, we next tested whether accumulation of mLIR1-CRY1 or mLIR4-CRY1 was sufficient to suppress hepatic glucose production/blood glucose levels. Indeed, mice injected with mLIR1-CRY1 or mLIR4-CRY1, but not mLIR2-CRY1 and mLIR3-CRY1 constructs, displayed reduced G6P protein levels (Fig. 5F) and decreased blood glucose levels at 7pm (Fig. 5G–5J). Furthermore, mLIR1-CRY1 or mLIR4-CRY1-injected mice, and not the mLIR2-CRY1 and mLIR3-CRY1-injected mice, exhibited less glucose production when subjected to PTTs (Fig. 5K) – indicating that LIR motifs 271DLYKKV276 and 492SRYRGL497 link CRY1 turnover by autophagy to regulation of gluconeogenesis.
The non-functional LIR motif YQQL in positions 488-491, and the functional LIR motif YRGL in positions 494-497, are both incorporated inside the disordered region fragment in positions 471-606.
The CCCH zinc-finger motif (297–334) was totally disordered in our structure of NCD-ZF, although SDS–PAGE analysis confirmed that the CCCH zinc finger was not degraded in the crystal.
The N-terminal 22 residues (i.e. 112–133) and residues 216–222 are missing in the final model due to the absence of interpretable electron density.
"Residues 574-584 are not observed and must be disordered"
Residues 888– 898, which run antiparallel to helix 9, are disordered.
Based on the statement "USP8 Catalytic Domain—At the carboxyl terminus of the
molecule, a 376-residue fragment containing the catalytic
domain of USP8 was crystallized (Fig. 4)." and the missing electron density for this region this segment can considered as disordered.
Similarly, PP1Cα residues 300–330 that are disordered in the crystal probably do not contribute to binding GM
To test this, we reconstituted a PP1 complex containing PP1Cα (7–300) and the human GL residues 31–105 [referred to as GL (31–105) hereafter] and crystallized it.   
The final model containing PP1Cα residues 7–299 and GL residues 59–77 (Figs. 3B) was refined to a resolution of 3.32 Å, and agrees well with the diffraction data and expected geometric values (Table 2)
Statement in the paper only describes that after crystallization of the N-terminal 31-105 residues, residues 59-77 are present. To assign this IDR region I considered that the original publication 
I) also crystallized the homologous N-terminal of Q16821 (PDB: 5ZQV), where 1-60 and 78-98 residues were described as disordered (see DP03014 - Statement: SDS/PAGE analysis of the crystal revealed no obvious degradation of GM (Fig. 1E), therefore GM residues 1–60 and 82–99 included in the crystalized complex but not observed in the electron density map are most likely disordered) AND II) Missing X-ray coordinates (PDB: 5ZT0) indeed support this region is disordered

The α4–α5 loop of the Bcr-Abl DH domain is very dynamic and does not adopt a preferred conformation (Fig. 2a).
No electron density was observed for the extended flexible α4–α5
loop region seen in the NMR structure, so this loop was not
included in the crystallographic model.
Residues 1-11 of BinA and residues 1-34 of BinB were disordered in the electron density map and therefore not included in the model (crystallization at pH 7.0)
The loop region Asp205-Thr214 is disordered and not modeled in both structures. Loop Glu249-Ile262 disordered and hence not modeled in form I is ordered in the form II crystal. The C-terminal residues (Val422- Lys439) are not modeled due to poor electron density in both structures. The absence of the C-terminal residues and the disordered region (Glu249-Ile262) is not due to autolysis as shown by SDS-PAGE analysis on crystals of both forms (data not shown) (24, 25).”

The N-terminal 38 residues (18–56) of the crystallized construct of CdtA are not visible in the electron density, nor are residues 183–185 of CdtB (internal loop). 

It is probable, therefore, that residues 18–67 are normally disordered in the complex, but a fortuitous crystal-packing arrangement allowed for the region between 56 and 67 to become ordered
The structural model contains CdiA-CTo11 EC869 residues Val85 – Lys297 (numbered from Val1 of the VENN motif) and Ala2 – Arg164 of CdiIo11 EC869
In contrast, the CdiA-CT N-terminal regions are not fully resolved in the structures and their functional significance remains unclear. The N-terminal regions are exceptionally labile to proteolysis, suggesting these domains are flexible and perhaps partially disordered. Intrinsically flexible domains are critical for colicin toxin import (23, 24), so perhaps the N-terminal region mediates CdiA-CT transport across the target cell envelope
Residue V85 mentioned by the authors, refers to residue V165 of the UNIPROT sequence and residue K297 corresponds to residue K377 of the UNIPROT sequence
The structural model contains CdiA-CTII Bp1026b residues Gly163 – Pro294 and residues Ala2 – Arg101 of CdiIII Bp1026b
The CdiA-CTo11 EC869/CdiIo11 EC869 complex was stable; however, the N-terminus of the CdiA-CTII Bp1026b showed significant degradation after purification, suggesting that this region is sensitive to proteolysis

However, the A2 linkers share only 38% sequence identity between LT-IIa and LT-IIb and have only 21% sequence
identity with LT-I [10,11].”

In addition, the C-terminal residues 231–243 of the A2 chain could not be traced. However, substantial yet uninterpretable electron density in the pore persists in Fo–Fc maps contoured at the 2s level, indicating a partially disordered conformation for these terminal residues
The residues referred to by the authors as 231-243 correspond to UNIPROT entry residues 251-263
The lower part of the pore holds the remaining 13 C-terminal residues, for which some electron density is present. Since the last interpretable residue (Asn230) is already two-thirds of the way down the 30 Å long pore (Fig. 8), it seems likely that not all 13 remaining residues will fit inside the lower part of the pore. The four C-terminal residues lysine, aspartate, glutamate, leucine (KDEL) in the A2 fragment of LT-IIb, being an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal [48], will thus most likely extend outside the pore, similar to the arginine, aspartate, glutamate, leucine (RDEL) terminus in LT-I [3,4].

In LT-IIb, residue 230 is not part of the helix and residues 231–243 could not be fit in the uninterpretable electron density present in the lower half of the pore. The interactions between A2 and the B pentamer in the upper part of the pore are entirely hydrophobic in nature by means of Phe220, Thr221, Leu222, Met223, Thr224, Leu225, Leu226, and Ile228 of A2 interacting with Met69, Ala70, Leu73 and the Cb of Ser74 of each of the B subunits. In fact, upon A2–B5 association, a surface of 1127 Å2 is buried, of which 869 Å2 is hydrophobic.

The involvement of the ER retention signal in LT intoxication has been postulated. However, recent studies have reached different conclusions concerning the role of RDEL/KDEL-dependent retrograde transport through the Golgi-ER during intoxication by CT and LT-I [49,50]
Our structure further demonstrates the remarkable plasticity of the substrate binding cleft of the BoNT/

Our structure further demonstrates the remarkable plasticity of the substrate binding cleft of the BoNT/
A LC protease and provides a paradigm for iterative structure-based design and development of BoNT/A LC inhibitors

Electron density for the 250 loop of the BoNT/A LC is only observed for structures of the LC complexed with PLMs containing either no side chain (i.e. a Gly component) or an Ala in the P29 position (Figure 7C). In contrast, no electron density is observed for various residues within this loop for either the unbound form of the BoNT/A LC, or when bound to arginine hydroxamate (ArgHX) (residues 245–256), I1 (residues 250–253), or JTH-NB72-39 (residues 247–255) (Figure 7C). In all BoNT/A LC:inhibitor complexes described
Residues 1–413 were clearly defined, however no electron density was observed for the N-terminal tag and the C-terminal end (414–439), all in solvent-accessible areas
In the WT domain, dynamic flexibility occurs at the N-terminus and the first α-helix that connects the HlyIIC domain to the HlyII-core structure. In the destabilizing P405M mutant, increased flexibility is evident throughout the first subdomain

As shown in Fig. 4A, most residues in the regular secondary structure HlyIIC have S 2 order parameters in the rigid limit. Low S2 order parameters indicative of dynamic flexibility occur for the N-terminal segment that connects HlyIIC to the rest of the HlyII protein, the N-terminal α-helix (αA), and the loops between secondary structure units - in particular the loop between helix αB and strand β5 that includes the site of the P405M mutation. The dynamic nature of the N-terminal linker segment corresponding to the first 11 amino acids of HlyIIC appears to be conserved in the full-length HlyII toxin, in as much as HlyIIC can be proteolytically cleaved from HlyII
The non-zero R2ex terms are due to conformational exchange on the µs-ms timescale. The majority of residues that experience R2ex contributions are in the two helices αA and αB
Figure 1 legend: The first 11 residues at the disordered N-terminus are not shown.
The region is a linker between two ordered domains, and the BMRB code attached is for the P405M mutant, for which the 3D structure was calculated and the relaxation data was measured.
In the WT domain, dynamic flexibility occurs at the N-terminus and the first α-helix that connects the HlyIIC domain to the HlyII-core structure. In the destabilizing P405M mutant, increased flexibility is evident throughout the first subdomain

Backbone amide proton protection factors in WT-HlyIIC are uniformly large for residues in regular secondary structure. The exception is helix αA, where only a single residue shows weak protection (Fig. 5B,D). In the P405M mutant (Fig. 5C), the largest protection factors are reduced about 2.5-fold compared to WT, consistent with the lower stability of the mutant to unfolding (Fig. 3B). A much more dramatic change is seen when the structure distribution of protection factors in the P405M mutant is considered. The amide protons from subdomain 2 in the second half of the molecule are protected but only two amide protons from subdomain 1 show measurable protection, at the beginning of strand β2 (Fig. 5C,E)

The dynamic nature of the N-terminal linker segment corresponding to the first 11 amino acids of HlyIIC appears to be conserved in the full-length HlyII toxin, in as much as HlyIIC can be proteolytically cleaved from HlyII
In the monomer model (Fig. 6A), the HlyIIC domain extends from the toxin core at an edge of the β-sandwich structure opposite that of the stem loop, so that an interaction between the two segments is highly unlikely. Fig. 6B and C show the homology model of the heptameric membrane-spanning pore complex. Even with a fully extended linker, the domain appears to be too far away to interact with the pore component of the structure (Fig. 6B and C), in agreement with experimental results that indicate HlyIIC does not obstruct the toxin pore in voltage gating experiments
The linker segment between the N-terminus of HlyIIC domain and the C-terminus of the HlyII core is highly flexible and can be proteolytically cleaved
Limited proteolysis of the oligomers formed by HlyII and HlyII(ΔCT) on red cell membranes showed that the C‐terminal extension is sensitive to digestion, while HlyII(ΔCT) is protease resistant and migrates with an electrophoretic mobility similar to that of digested HlyII

multiple proteolytic fragments at low protease concentrations (5 μg mL−1; Fig. 3, lane 2). In contrast, the oligomeric form of HlyII(ΔCT), like the αHL heptamer, was protease resistant. At the highest concentration of proteinase K (500 μg mL−1), a protease‐resistant, SDS‐stable form of oligomeric HlyII was formed, which migrated in SDS gels with a similar mobility to oligomers formed from the genetically truncated HlyII(ΔCT) (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the C‐terminal extension either has a structure with pronounced sensitivity to proteolytic cleavage, or that the extension is connected to the rest of the protein through a readily accessible linker. The former is favored because the C terminus (TL, see below) expressed as a separate domain is protease sensitive (data not shown)

The N terminal domain is defined between residues 1-288 in this paper, which corresponds to residues 31 to 318 of the Uniprot entry, and the C terminal domain is defined in this paper as residues 289-382, which corresponds to residues 319-412 of the Uniprot entry. This is consistent with the presence of the signal peptide in the Uniprot entry and the fact that this is a secreted protein.
While the PEST-like sequence (aa 39–51) is well resolved (Fig. 2), the preceding residues 25–38 are, due to their flexibility, not visible in the structure.
We have determined the crystal structure of JHP933 at 2.17 A ̊resolution. The refined model contains 452 residues from two monomers of the recombinant JHP933 and 257 water molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. It encompasses the residues 12–232 ofJHP933 and four (or six) residues of the C-terminal tag in chain A (or B). 
We show that, contrary to expectation, YdaS behaves as a monomer and contains an intrinsically disordered region at its C-terminus. This makes it the representative of a fourth yet uncharacterized class of HigA proteins.
Predicted from the backbone chemical shifts using the chemical  shift  index  (CSI)  function  and  the  DANGLE  module (Cheung et al. 2010) in CCPNMR, the secondary structure of YdaS consists of five short α-helices, followed by a tail that contains several isolated residues with a high propensity for β-strand. There is, however, only a single such stretch (residues 80–90) that contains three residues, which indicates that likely no real β-sheet is formed and that the C-terminal tail lacks regular secondary structure (Fig. 3).
It is likely that the two missing regions, residues 1–26 in p33 domain and 300–334 between p33 and p55 domains, in our current map are highly flexible.
Authors mention region 300-334. Although these boundaries are true for the protein chain without signal peptide, they correspond to region 333-367 in the UniProt sequence. The 1-26 short hydrophobic region was told to be inserted into the membrane in the native protein, so it cannot be considered as disordered, this is why it was not annotated separately.
Partial proteolytic digestion of the mature secreted 88-kDa VacA toxin yields two fragments that are ∼33 and 55 kDa in mass (p33 and p55, respectively) (see Fig. 1A). This proteolytic cleavage occurs primarily between amino acids 311 and 312 of the mature secreted toxin from H. pylori strain 60190 (and possibly several adjacent sites) (27), which are predicted to comprise a hydrophilic surface-exposed loop of VacA.
The authors do not define the precise length of the digested region but mention that several neighboring residues might also be affected, therefore I have added 5 residues on each side of the two residues named as the primary cleavage site. Authors mention residues 311-312, but those correspond to residues 344-345 in the UniProt sequence due to the presence of a 33 residues long signal peptide in the latter.

For refinement and statistical calculations, regions with unassigned backbone trace were eliminated from the model when at termini or in loops larger than five residues: RAP74: B2-4, B63-72, B154-172, D2-6, D64-72, D169-172, F2-4, F63-72, H2-6, H63-72, H154-172 (101 residues).
The electron density for amino acid residues 64-72, including the evolutionarily conserved E70, is not observed in the map. Flexibility in the arm domain is indicated by the high average root-mean-square deviation of 2.4 Å for 30 Cα-positions for all pair-wise comparisons of the four copies of the arm.

A long acidic insert (residues 702–725) between AR6 and AR7 is disordered.
Residues 162 to 175 were disordered and therefore not included in the final model.
The results of structural calculation revealed that the
N-terminal residues 9–18 form an a-helix (N-helix), as
predicted previously (Stutz et al. 2000). The helical structure is supported by the chemical shift index (Wishart and
Sykes 1994), strong sequential HN-HN NOE contacts, and
several weak NOEs between residue side chains (Fig. 3A,B). One side of the N-helix is formed by hydrophobic residues,
and the opposite side is polar. The N-helix is likely to be
transient, as the values of heteronuclear 15N[1
H] NOEs for
this region were significantly reduced compared with those
for the RRM (Fig. 6B, see below), and the intensities of Ha/
Hb(i) to HN(i+3/i+4) NOE cross-peaks were smaller than
expected for stable a-helices. The remainder of the N domain appears largely unstructured, although some regions
have restricted mobility (see below).
The absence of long-range proton–proton NOEs and
reduced 15N[1
H] NOEs indicates that the N domain is
flexible (Fig. 6B, see below) yet has restricted mobility in
the following regions: amino acids 6–23, 30–34, and 46–62,
mapping to the N-helix, and Arg- and aromatic-rich
regions, respectively (Fig. 1). This suggests that regions of
the N domain may have the propensity to form local structure and/or interact with other parts of REF2-I.
The RNA binding activity of NM was investigated here
using NMR chemical shift and dynamic mapping. In 50 mM
L-Arg, L-Glu a number of residues from the N domain of
NM displayed signal shifts on addition of a 15-mer RNA
oligonucleotide (Fig. 6A, left panel, B) with changes for
amino acids 7–24 and 29–47 being most pronounced, consistent with EMSA data (Rodrigues et al. 2001; Zenklusen et al. 2001.)
To investigate further which residues participate in RNA
binding we measured the changes in heteronuclear 15N[1
H]
NOEs that provide a quantitative parameter for mobility of
polypeptide chain. Residues 15–58 show significantly increased heteronuclear 15N[1
H] NOEs upon addition of
RNA, indicating reduced mobility and direct involvement
in RNA binding (Fig. 6B), even in high-salt buffer, yet the
heteronuclear 15N[1
H] NOEs for amino acids 7–14 were
virtually unchanged, implying these residues are not directly involved in RNA binding, despite the changes in their
amide signal positions.
We investigated
the changes in the HSQC spectra on
addition of nonlabeled DDX39 to
15N,2
H-labeled NM. A significant number of NM signals in the NM:DDX39
disappear from the spectra due to line
broadening, suggesting that both the
N and RRM domains are involved in
complex formation (Fig. 8A,C).
In the N
domain, signals disappear within amino acids 5–16, which
includes a major part of the N-helix, and additionally within
amino acids 29–41 from the Arg-rich region. Together the
biochemical and NMR data indicate that NM presents an
extended binding interface for DDX39 involving both the N
and RRM domains.
Analysis of HSQC spectra of 15N,2
H-NM upon addition
of TAP-p15 revealed that signals from amino acids 8, 9, 17
(N-helix), and 23–48 (Arg-rich) of the N domain are broadened and disappear from the spectra (Fig. 8B,C). In
contrast to the complex of NM with DDX39, no signals
belonging to the RRM disappear completely nor are shifted
significantly in the NM:TAP-p15 spectra.
We assessed the contribution of the N and RRM domains to the DDX39 interaction using GST pull-down assays (Fig. 8D). The
D53 construct was used in these assays, since further
truncation of the protein leads to extensive perturbation of the HSQC spectrum for the RRM (Fig. 4C).
Whereas NM showed a strong interaction with DDX39, the D53 construct encompassing the RRM showed a weak
interaction.
This is consistent with the GST pull-down data,
which show that TAP interacts weakly with the RRM and
more strongly with NM (Fig. 8D).
The NMR experiments therefore all indicate that ALYREF
partially displaces the viral RNA initially bound specifically to
ORF57, but retains it within the complex. In the ternary complex
ORF57 aa106–120 directly interacts with the ALYREF RRM,
whereas flexible flanking regions of ALYREF (aa24–48) and
ORF57 (aa81–92), and to lesser extent, parts of helix 2 of the
ALYREF RRM, jointly keep hold of the viral RNA molecule.
Interestingly, amide signals from flexible protein regions which
become involved in direct contacts with RNA (as evidenced by
RNA-protein saturation transfer), are only partially broadened in
the complex. They had intensities higher than signals from the
folded regions, but lower than signals from the unfolded noninteracting regions (examples of this behavior can be seen in Fig. 5
and Fig. S5). This suggests that the interaction with RNA in these
conditions was somewhat transient and did not lead to the
formation of a rigid 3D structure.
CED-4b exhibits a similar structure, except that its CARD domain is flexible and disordered in the crystals.
However, the CARD domain of CED-4a adopts a rigid conformation through interactions with thea/b-fold of CED-4b and CED-9, whereas the CARD domain of CED-4b is disordered in the crystals.
The CD spectra of
the ICP27 N-terminal 160 amino acids (Fig. 5A) were consistent with a protein in a random-coil conformation due to the
shape of the CD curve (31).

H-15N HSQC spectra
for the ICP27 N-terminal protein alone showed peaks that
were not well dispersed in the proton dimension and that
resonated between 7.5 and 9.0 ppm (Fig. 5B). Proton HSQC
chemical shifts in this range are typical of shifts found in
proteins with a random-coil conformation (42). Each HSQC
signal represents one N-H group in the protein, and there
should be at least 1 peak per amino acid of the protein. Approximately 70 clearly defined HSQC peaks were observed in
the ICP27 N-terminal HSQC spectra, which is less than half of
the expected 160 HSQC peaks. There was also a high degree of
signal overlap in the region between 8.0 and 9.0 ppm in the
proton dimension and in the region between 120 and 124 ppm
in the nitrogen dimension, which prevents the resolution of all
160 HSQC peaks. The lack of peak dispersion and the high
degree of peak overlap in the ICP27 N-terminal HSQC spectrum suggests that the protein is not in a single conformation,
nor is it rigidly folded.
HET-NOE spectrum of the ICP27 N-terminal 160 amino
acids reveals a flexible yet compact conformation.
The gC oligonucleotide
gC 1-30 was shifted well by the wild-type ICP27 N-terminal
protein (Fig. 1B). The substitution of lysine for arginine at
residue 148 (R148K) or at residues 138 and 150 (R138,150K)
did not affect the ability of the ICP27 N terminus to shift the
gC 1-30 sequence. An arginine-to-lysine substitution at residue
138 or 150 also did not affect the ability of the ICP27 N
terminus to shift gC 1-30 (data not shown). However, triple
arginine-to-lysine substitutions at residues 138, 148, and 150
showed reduced binding because the mutant protein did not
efficiently shift gC 1-30. 
The R138,148,150K mutant binds poorly to GC-rich sequences bound by wild-type (WT) ICP27.
These results suggest that three arginines at
positions 138, 148, and 150 within the RGG box motif are all
required to efficiently shift gC sequences.
To determine if arginine residues 138, 148,
and 150 within the RGG box were also required for efficient
RNA export by ICP27 during infection, we looked at the localization of poly(A) RNA at 8 h after infection, when viral
transcription is much more active than cellular transcription
(40). Cells were infected with wild-type HSV-1 KOS and the
RGG, R138,150K, and R138,148,150K mutants (Fig. 2).
Poly(A) was visualized by hybridization with an oligo(dT)
probe. ICP27 is actively shuttling at 8 h after infection and was
seen to be predominantly cytoplasmic in both wild-type and
mutant infections (Fig. 2). Poly(A) was seen to be distributed
in the cytoplasm of KOS-infected cells, as expected, whereas
poly(A) RNA was confined to the nucleus in RGG-infected
cells, as seen previously. Poly(A) RNA was seen to be present
in the cytoplasm of cells infected with the R138,150K mutant,
but in contrast, poly(A) RNA was nuclear in cells infected
with the R138,148,150K mutant (Fig. 2).

The GDP moiety bound to the SMG9 G domain is shown in stick representation. Disordered loops are highlighted with dotted lines.
First, there is a conserved proline residue (Pro153SMG9, disordered in the present structure) at the position of switch 2 typically occupied by a glycine (Fig. 2B,C).
At the corresponding position of Asp218Atlastin, SMG9 features a conserved lysine residue (Lys241SMG9) that stacks with its aliphatic portion on top of the guanine base. With the caveat that motif  G5 is largely  disordered, none of the interactions in the current structure engage guanine-specific moieties. 
The G domains of SMG8c and SMG9c face each other and interact with part of their convex surfaces (Fig. 1B).
GDP binds SMG9c at a similar position as in Atlastin and GBP1, in particular with similarities at the phosphatebinding loops, e.g., at the motifs G1 (P loop), G2 (switch 1), and G3 (switch 2) (Fig. 2B,C). In SMG9c, the P loop residues Lys99SMG9 and Ser100SMG9 coordinate the phosphates of GDP. Although parts of the switch regions are disordered in our GDP-bound structure, the switch 2 residue Asp150SMG9 is at the position expected for coordinating the magnesium ion, while the switch 1 residue Thr135SMG9 is 10 Å away from the position expected upon γ -phosphate binding.

Securin, which forms an extended structure that interacts mainly with the  periphery of separase, was well resolved around the substrate-binding site but less well defined elsewhere (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Table 1).

The  αsolenoid domain accommodates two disordered insertions. Insert-1 includes the site of  regulatory CDK-phosphorylation of human separase 17, 28, whereas Insert-2 incorporates the auto-cleavage sites 2 ,29 ,30 and cyclin B1 (refs 15, 18  ) and PP2A   31   binding sites of  vertebrate separase (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 4).

In its free form the Nterminal region aa8–120 of ORF57 is flexible and mainly
unstructured, apart from the short a-helix aa108–118 which we
named R-b helix.
Our experimental NMR data,
namely dihedral angles derived from TALOS+ [42], 15N[1
H] NOE
experiments, and presence of characteristic i to i+3 NOEs for a
shorter peptide ORF57103–120 (see Fig. S2), also all demonstrate that
the ORF578–120 site aa107–118 exists in a-helical conformation;
therefore this region was named ‘‘R-b helix’’.
In contrast, the ORF57-specific oligos caused substantial signal broadening in
all signals corresponding to the region aa64–120 (Fig. 1A).
Signal perturbation mapping therefore suggested a specific
RNA binding site encompassing aa64–120 within ORF578–120,
whilst also showing the ALYREF-binding region aa103–120
located within this site is not sufficient for the recognition of
specific viral RNA.
Based on the results of saturation transfer
mapping, which are also in line with signal perturbation mapping,
we conclude that ORF578–120 contacts the specific RNA motifs
directly using primarily its regions aa107–120 and aa81–92, with
additional contribution from residues within aa94–105 and aa64–
79.

ORF57 aa106–120 directly interacts with the ALYREF RRM,

The results of NMR mapping of RNA binding regions of
ORF578–120 were confirmed by UV cross-linking using purified
protein and radio-labeled RNA oligonucleotide, performed as
previously described [10]. The ORF57 mutants Y81A+R82A,
R88A+F89A and W108A+R111A+V112A all significantly reduced the efficiency of cross-linking with RNA 14merS (Fig. 7A).
To independently confirm the NMR observations in regard to
RNA oligonucleotide binding with ORF578–120, ALYREF1–155
and their complex, we performed in vitro reconstitution assays
followed by UV cross-linking experiments. ORF578–120 showed a
strong RNA-binding activity for 7merS and 14merS in sharp
contrast to GST-ALYREF which bound weakly with both RNAs
(Fig. 7B,C). When ORF578–120 was incubated with RNA prior to
mixing with GST-ALYREF, followed by GST affinity purification
of the resulting complexes and UV cross-linking, there was a
drastic reduction of the RNA cross-linked to ORF578–120 and a
concomitant increase in the RNA cross-linked onto GSTALYREF. Therefore the RNA-binding activity of ORF578–120 is
severely reduced upon interaction with ALYREF, whereas the
amount of RNA in contact with ALYREF increases in the ternary
complex. This independent data obtained at a molecular (i.e,
macroscopic) level concurs fully with the NMR data obtained at a
residue-specific level of detail. 
In this study we used solution state NMR to reveal molecular
details of the ternary complex assembly of functional fragments of
HVS ORF57, HVS RNA and ALYREF, and suggest a model for
the mechanism of RNA transfer between protein molecules in this
system.
The NMR experiments therefore all indicate that ALYREF
partially displaces the viral RNA initially bound specifically to
ORF57, but retains it within the complex. In the ternary complex
ORF57 aa106–120 directly interacts with the ALYREF RRM,
whereas flexible flanking regions of ALYREF (aa24–48) and
ORF57 (aa81–92), and to lesser extent, parts of helix 2 of the
ALYREF RRM, jointly keep hold of the viral RNA molecule.
Interestingly, amide signals from flexible protein regions which
become involved in direct contacts with RNA (as evidenced by
RNA-protein saturation transfer), are only partially broadened in
the complex. They had intensities higher than signals from the
folded regions, but lower than signals from the unfolded noninteracting regions (examples of this behavior can be seen in Fig. 5
and Fig. S5). This suggests that the interaction with RNA in these
conditions was somewhat transient and did not lead to the
formation of a rigid 3D structure.
The experimental fluorescence equilibrium binding data thus
reveal the overall cooperativity in the ternary complex formation
when the components are present at or near stoichiometric
amounts, and support a role of ORF57 as an adaptor introducing
RNA to ALYREF.

As the measured Kd values
for the formation of binary complexes are significantly higher than
for the ternary complexes (e.g., Kd
O+R= 7.57 mM.
Kd
OA+R= 1.55 mM), the assembly shows clear-cut cooperative behavior [44].
Because no long range NOEs were observed for residues 91–120, and 15N-1H heteronuclear NOEvalues (Fig. 2A) confirmed that those C-terminal residues are dynamically disordered on the picosecond to nanosecond timescale (23), the final structure calculations included only CoB residues 1–90. 
Values for residues 91–120 (not shown) ranged from -0.4 to +0.2 consistent with an absence of defined tertiary structure beyond the extent of the β-grasp domain.
Disordered C-terminal residues of the construct used in this analysis may serve as a flexible linker between the N-terminal Ubl domain and the C-terminal CAP-Gly domain (12) of CoB.
Most of BRD3-L outside of the core ET domain appears to be disordered.
15N HSQC spectra of BRD3-L and
BRD3-ET are shown in Fig. 3A. The majority of peaks in the
spectrum of BRD3-L (Fig. 3A, black) appear as intense, overlapping signals with amide proton shifts in the 8.0– 8.6 ppm region
of the spectrum, a pattern characteristic of the disordered polypeptide. A number of weaker and more dispersed signals are
also observed. In contrast, peaks in the 15N HSQC of BRD3-ET
(Fig. 3A, red) are well-dispersed, as expected of a small, folded
protein domain. An overlay of the two 15N HSQC spectra
reveals that almost all signals in the BRD3-ET spectrum are
essentially unchanged in the BRD3-L spectrum, indicating that
the folded ET domain takes up the same conformation in the
context of the longer polypeptide.

  The overall fold of the apo
structure is similar to that of the E. coli TruB–RNA complex (14)
but with one striking difference: a 29-aa segment (residues 124–152) of the apoprotein corresponding to the thumb-loop
region is disordered in the crystals and was not observed in the
electron density map.
A 29-amino acid segment containing residues
124–152 was not observed in the electron density.
 The most prominent
change is that a 29-aa segment (residues 124–152) of the protein
corresponding to the thumb-loop region, which is totally disordered in the apoprotein, becomes ordered on RNA binding. It
is possible that the thumb loop is unstructured in the RNA-free
state, or it oscillates between free and bound forms, and the
RNA binding shifts the equilibrium to the bound form.
The structure of the second molecule (Mol-B), which is illustrated in Figure 3b, is essentially the same except that the looping-out region (referred to as the BLM-insertion) is disordered.
Structure of Mol-A. Secondary-structure elements (five α-helices and two β-strands) are labeled. The BLM-insertion (a.a. 1093–1106) and C-term extended loop (a.a. 1183–1194) are colored red
The long and flexible loop between α1 and α2 (α1–α2 loop, from H1091 to T1100), which has several missed N–H peaks in the 1H–15N HSQC (R1098, N1099, S1106 and G1107), is not well converged.
According to Fig2, PDB and UniProt sequence data, T1100 referred in the text has wrong numbering. The correct end boundary is the disordered regions is T1110.
All of the residues of BLM are present in the final model with the exception of the first three residues at the N-terminus and eight at the C-terminus, and two loops spanning residues 1004–1016 and 1093–1106 which are disordered.

The wild-type protein bound to HJ in the micromolar range, while the loopΔ10 mutation resulted in a severe loss of binding (~50% loss at 5 μM). This loss is consistent with the present HJ-binding model in which the BLM-insertion interacts with a duplex arm of HJ

In the full-length protein, the C-term extended loop is followed by the 13 amino acids 1195SSSVKKQKALVAK1207, which tether the C-terminal HRDC domain (Figure 5d). Interestingly, this linker is considerably shorter than that of WRN (77 residues)

Accordingly, residues 86–97 have been omitted from our model owing to a lack of interpretable electron density.
The crystallographic model included amino-acid residues 3–85, 98–299 and 320–336. Atoms with little or no electron density were deemed to be disordered and were omitted from the final model.
Residues 301–320 in the hLN40 QTK loop are disordered; however, we can infer from MutL structures (Ban et al., 1999 ▸) that Lys311 within the PTK motif should act as the conserved basic, γ-phosphate-sensing residue

The comparison between the [1
H,15N]-TROSY spectrum of a deuterated GB1-dsRBM12 and the [1
H,15N]-HSQC spectra
of both isolated dsRBM1 and dsRBM2 (Figure S1; see
the Supplemental Data available with this article online)
shows that the dsRBM resonances are identical in both
contexts, except for a few N- and C-terminal residues.
In addition, this comparison indicates that the interdomain linker is flexible, as the chemical shifts of the
linker residues have random coil values (Stefl et al.,
2005b).
These results indicate that the ADAR2
dsRBMs are independent domains separated by a flexible linker,similar to the two dsRBMs of PKR(Nanduriet al.,
1998).
This strategy could be used considering (1) the distinct RNA binding location for each dsRBMs, with no mutual interactions (Stefl et al., 2006), (2) the flexible unstructured linker connecting dsRBM1 and dsRBM2 in the complex (Stefl et al., 2006) and (3) an overlap in the RNA sequence of the joint region of the subcomplexes (Figure 1).

Residues of the N-terminus (1–3, 52–54), the linker region (666– 715) and the C-terminus (1307–1321) were not visible in the electron density map and were  not included in the final structure.

This flexible linker connects nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1)  and transmembrane domain 2 (TMD) of protein P-gp.
All experimental conditions we assayed
yielded samples that provide NMR data in agreement with
the absence of tertiary structure (Supplementary Figure
S1). Only ∼80% of the signals corresponding to the RBS1 domain were defined in the spectrum, precluding the unambiguous assignment of all resonances. Still, we have assigned
some fragments of the sequence using standard backbone
triple resonance experiments. Based on these assignments
and on the dispersion of the NMR signals shown in the
spectrum, we conclude that the RBS1 construct has a short
helical conformation surrounded by unstructured regions,
yielding the ensemble of flexible conformations observed
in 2D and 3D NOESY (Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy) experiments.
Therefore,
we conclude that a bipartite RNA-binding site, comprising
residues 1297–1412 (RBS1) and 1383–1508 (RBS2), within
the C-terminal region of Gemin5 enables a direct interaction with the IRES element with RBS1 being more intense
than RBS2 in UV-crosslinking experiments.
SM3' was disordered and was not visible in either a2NC1 homo or a4NC1 homo (Fig. 3)
Overall, a comparison of noncanonical and canonical oligomers (Figs. 3a and 3b) revealed that the SM1, SM1’ and SM2 flexible regions are key determinants in protomer formation, while the loops connecting these motifs, Lb7b8 (motif ClA), Lb70b80 and SM3’, are needed to establish the protomer–protomer interactions that generate the hexamer.
Proposed model for canonical hexamer assembly. Individual monomers (a) start to nucleate a protomer via

b-sheets I/I0 (b). Next, the SM1/1’ and SM2/SM2’ flexible regions from b-sheets II/II0 are stabilized in the nascent protomer, resulting in favoured additional intersubunit interactions within the protomer (c). Final stabilization is attained with the proper folding of SM3’ and of the ClA and ClB motifs that allow the binding of chloride ions (green spheres) (d). The two protomers in the hexamer are now ready to be joined by sulfilimine bonds (red lines).
Our findings of noncanonical assemblies for a2NC1 and a4NC1 homo-oligomers and the structural changes observed in the chains forming these noncanonical protomers in comparison to a2NC1_121 and to the chains in a1NC1homo, a3NC1homo and a5NC1homo could imply that chain folding is closely related to protomer assembly. It is unlikely that a2NC1homo and a4NC1homo could represent stable physiological assemblies, but the structures of the individual chains in these noncanonical oligomers might provide a frozen glimpse of transient conformational states in the process of NC1 folding and hexamer building.
The rms deviation between the common Ca atoms of both models (1-17, 31-63, 71-145 and 160-171) is 0.42 AÊ, and thus only slightly higher than expected from the coordinate errors. The largest deviations occur in the loop regions and smaller ones in turns T1 through to T3, and they correlate with the chain mobilities (Figure 2).
Loops L1, L2 and L4 have no density, indicating that they are extremely mobile.
Please, notice that residue numbering in the author statements refer to a construct lacking the N-terminal signal peptide. This entry refers to extracellular loop L1. Extracellular loop L2 is not listed due to its short length (<10 AAs).
The membrane domain of OmpA consists of an eight-stranded all-next-neighbor antiparallel beta-barrel with short turns at the periplasmic barrel end and long flexible loops at the external end. The structure analysis has been extended from medium resolution to 1.65 A (1 A=0.1 nm), and the molecular model has been refined anisotropically to show oriented mobilities of the structural elements.
The analysis indicates that the beta-barrel constitutes a solid scaffold such that the long external loops need not contribute to stability. These loops are highly mobile and thus cause a major problem during the crystallization process.

The final OmpG model includes ∼90% of the residues of the mature protein; the residues 20–27 in loop L1, 59-60 in L2, 220–231 in L6 and 261–266 in L7 are not visible in the electron density maps, presumably because they are disordered.

Furthermore, a C-terminal segment containing two essential cysteine residues (Cys-Gly-Cys), which is disordered in the IscA structure, is clearly visible in one molecule (the a1 subunit) of the SufA homodimer. Although this segment is disordered in the other molecule (the a2 subunit), computer modeling of this segment based on the well-defined conformation of a1 subunit suggests that the four cysteine residues (Cys114 and Cys116 in each subunit) in the Cys-Gly-Cys motif are positioned in close proximity at the dimer interface. 
The model contains 114 of 122 residues for the a1 subunit, and 102 residues for the a2 subunit, together with 37 water molecules. Residues 1–8 in subunit a1, and residues 1–4, 48–51, and 111–122 in a2 subunit were omitted due to poor electron density. The difference of the visible region between a1 and a2 subunits may arise mainly from the crystal packing; the C-terminal region of a1 subunit interacts with the N-terminal region of the neighboring a2 subunit related by the crystallographic symmetry.
The three invariant cysteines at positions 50, 114, and 116 were clearly identified in the a1 subunit on the molecular surface, whereas those in the a2 subunit are disordered.
The corresponding cysteines are disordered in the a2 subunit, but a fragmentary electron density was observed in the Fo–Fc map near the C-terminal segment of the a1 subunit (data not shown). Hence, we have performed modeling to visualize the disordered segments, assuming that the main-chain conformation is identical between the two subunits. 
There is conflicting evidence on the structural state of this segment for the (identical) chains comprising the dimer. According to the authors this could be a crystalization artifact.
Only residues 1 – 143 were clearly modelled into the experimental map (Figure 3) with a final R-factor of 19.5% and good stereochemistry (Table 1), while we could find a suitable space for about 20 residues from 144–163 in the electron density map. We concluded, therefore, that removal of the 12  residues from the original was essential for crystallization and that the 20 remaining C-terminal residues of the fragment in the crystal are disordered.
The IDR characterized in the publication and spanning residues 56-67 in the experimental construct corresponds to region 74-85 of the amino acid sequence.
Adjacent to the C-terminal ends of their ordered parts, both fibril reconstructions show diffuse density (Supplementary Figure 5), indicating that C-terminal tails of the fibril proteins, corresponding to residues 70–83 in the murine and 56–67 in the human fibril proteins, are structurally disordered.

A segment of the RING domain (amino acids 40–54) that includes most of the central helix is disordered in the crystal and is shown in the figure as a grey backbone trace modeled using the NMR structure of the human TRIM5α RING.
Interestingly, the flexible N- and C-terminal regions of Sip1 are resolved to a large extent in the equatorial monomers with only 7 C- and 17 N-terminal residues missing, respectively (Figures 4C and 4D). 
In this study, the C-terminal thirteen amino acid residues of SecB were shown to be highly mobile.
The 1H NMR resonances of these thirteen C-terminal amino acid residues (Q143QAGEGTEEHQDA155) had narrow linewidths, and appeared at positions corresponding to random chemical shift values (Wuthrich, 1986). Therefore, these amino acid residues represent a mobile C-terminal tail of SecB.
In this study, it was demonstrated that SecB contains a highly mobile C-terminal region and that deletion of the C-terminal tail produced a stable truncated protein that was defective in its function under certain conditions. The 1H NMR spectrum of wild type SecB contained narrow resonances most of which could be assigned to the C-terminal thirteen amino acid residues of SecB.
In this study, we demonstrate that the C-terminal 13 residues of SecB were highly mobile using 1H NMR spectroscopy.
A protein lacking the C-terminal 13 amino acids of wild-type SecB was found to retain the ability to bind unfolded maltose-binding protein (MBP) in vitro but to interfere with the normal kinetics of pre-MBP export when overexpressed in vivo.
Deletion of the C-terminal mobile region of SecB was found to alter the function of SecB when the mutant protein was overproduced and overproduction of SecA reversed this defect.
When SecB142 lacking the C-terminal mobile region was expressed at high levels, a kinetic defect in the export of pre-MBP was observed, demonstrating that removal of the mobile region altered the function of SecB. Despite the truncation, SecB142 was capable of binding pre-MBP as demonstrated by its ability to block the refolding of unfolded MBP.
In vitro experiments (intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence), monitoring MBP(Y283D) refolding in the presence of SecB (wt or SecB142). Results displayed in Figure 2.
Deletion of the C-terminal mobile region of SecB was found to alter the function of SecB when the mutant protein was overproduced and overproduction of SecA reversed this defect.
As shown in Fig. 3A, pre-MBP export was severely defective in secB- strains containing vector only. In contrast, export was rapid in the same strain transformed with wild type secB on the overproducing plasmid. When the strain was transformed with the plasmid containing the secB142op mutation, a moderate export defect was observed. Pre-MBP export in the psecB142op containing strain exhibited the kinetics typically seen for other secB missense mutations (36, 37).
In Fig. 3B, the same set of plasmids were transformed into a strain containing a chromosomal secB+ allele. As expected, export was rapid in the strains containing wild type secB and a mild defect was evident in the strain containing secB+ on the overproducing plasmid. When the plasmid containing the secB142op mutation was transformed into the secB+ strain, a dominant negative export defect was observed. 
As seen in Fig. 3C, when SecA was overexpressed in a secB1- strain both the mild export defect due to wild type SecB overproduction, and the moderate defect of the secB142op mutation were suppressed. This result suggests that SecA levels were limiting in the presence of excess SecB and that this effect was more pronounced with the secB142op mutation.
In vivo experiments to determine whether SecB142 was functional: "pre- maltose binding protein (pre-MBP) export was analyzed by pulse-chase labeling of cells with Tran[35S]- label (ICN), extraction and immunoprecipitation with anti-MBP anti-serum. MBP species were analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography."
The model is not complete, as 8N-terminal residues and 11 C-terminal residues are not visible in the electron density maps. 
Notably, residues 661–702 of WWP2 were not built in the model owing to a lack of electron density, which might be the result of intrinsic flexibility
The electron density for the region between residues 45 and 58 was not observed and therefore not modeled.
Electron density between residues 45 and 58, comprising the BB‐loop and αB‐helix, was not observed and therefore not modeled. 
 Incidentally, the electron density corresponding to the BB‐loop residues of AtTIR was not visible, probably because of the intrinsic flexibility of this particular sequence.
In Deg5 (S266A), residues 111–125 from loop LA, 155–159 from loop LB and 287–295 from loop L2 cannot be traced in the electron-density map. These loops, together with loop L3 (241–251), which has significantly high B-factor values, are flexible in the crystal.
A few additional residues are invisible in the electron density map

Inspection of the electron densitymap and several rounds of refinement revealed that the first 24 N-terminal residues of the protein are disordered in four of the six DAP epimerase molecules in the asymmetric unit (chains A–C and E). However, this region is partially ordered in the remaining two molecules (chains D and F) with residues 15–22 forming an additional helix (α1) at the N-terminus.
The IDR characterized in the PDB and spanning residues 91-109 corresponds to region 107-125 of the amino acid sequence, since the natural precursor form of the protein contains a signal peptide (1-16) that is missing in the mature protein.

Although the C-terminal tail (residues 613–678) is part of the crystallized construct, it was  not visible in the structure; in particular, the extra  α helix (“helix C”) found just after the  arm repeats in crystals of full-length zebrafish  β-catenin (Xing et al., 2008) and in  plakoglobin (Choi et al., 2009) is absent.
To test whether the tails of HMP-2 affect the  affinity for pHMR-1  cyto80  , ITC experiments were performed using HMP-2  13end   and  HMP-2  54end  . The presence of the C-terminal tail of HMP-2 weakens the affinity  approximately 7-fold (23 nM vs. 3.1 nM), whereas the presence of the N-terminal tail did  not significantly affect binding to phosphorylated HMR-1 (Figs. 1A, S2, Table S2).

A long flexible α-helix protrudes from the structure at the C-terminal end.
In the crystallographic asymmetric unit of Form-1 crystal, there were two SiRs, designated as molecules A and B, aligned face-to-face; the structures of the polypeptide chain and two prosthetic groups were clearly revealed except for those of a flexible loop (Ser240 and Ala241 for molecule A and Gly236 to Ala241 for molecule B) and the terminal regions (the N-terminal ten residues and the C-terminal nine residues).
The construct's C-terminal residues correspond to annotated 53-62 region.

Finally, comparing behavior of full-length and N-terminally truncated GCH1 we conclude that the disordered GCH1 Nterminus does not have impact on complex formation and enzymatic activity.
Finally, we analyzed the effect of the disordered N-terminal 42 amino acids of GCH1 on GFRP complex formation and enzymatic activity to resolve contradicting literature data.
All attempts to purify this protein yielded mixtures of partially proteolyzed polypeptides as shown by SDS/PAGE. N-terminal sequencing showed that different subunits had been proteolyzed at any one of eight Arg residues in the N-terminal stretch of 41 residues, affording a variety of cleavage products.
Residues 149–180 and 82–88, corresponding to the disordered regions defined by HDX-MS of intact CTC (Fig. 1A) and encompassing the proteolyzed 161–167 segment, have little visible electron density in our maps and were not modeled (Fig. 1B).
IDR region boundaries were modified according to alignment of the PDB and UniProt sequences
The paper does not state this region is IDR, however atomic coordinates are missing from the PDB file. 3 Met residues present in this region were not included in the PDB protein construct.
 Surfactant protein C proprotein (proSP-C) contains four regions; a short N-terminal segment (residues 1–23) facing the cytosol and important for intracellular trafficking, a transmembrane (TM) region constituting the main part of mature SP-C (residues 24–58) eventually secreted with phospholipids into the alveoli, a linker region (residues 59–89), and a BRICHOS domain (residues 90–197), defined from the structure presented here and localized to the ER lumen (1) (Fig. 1A)
Psf1 has only an α-domain (residues 1–145), whereas all of its C-terminal 51 residues are disordered.
Possibly not IDR? "Kamada et al. (13) reported that their GINS complex crystallized only when a Psf1 mutant lacking the C-terminal 47 residues (14) was used, suggesting that the presence of this β-domain inhibited crystal packing of the GINS complex. Kamada et al. (13) proposed that the deleted region of Psf1 folds into a β-domain structure and that the correct positioning of this domain on the surface of the GINS complex is critical for function."
The last visible C-terminal residue of Psf1 (S145) before the disordered C-terminal domain is adjacent to the disordered fragment of Sld5 (residue 65–71) and to the disordered C-terminal residues of Psf3 (residues 194–216); these disordered regions are shown as spheres in Fig. 3d. The colocalization of these disordered parts of three different subunits on the GINS surface suggests that this site may bind partner proteins in the replication complex.

15N-labelled PY12 (containing both PPxY motifs; aa 361–567) was titrated against unlabeled WW12 (containing both WW domains; aa 163–266). The HSQCs of the free and bound PY12 were compared to observe changes in the peaks. The HSQC of free PY12 shows that the protein is unstructured, as most of the peaks are clustered together around the 1H chemical shift 8 ppm (Figure 6A green).
As observed in the structures of CSK kinase (c-SRC-specific tyrosine kinase) bound to staurosporine (27) and the SRC family kinase HCK (human Cyclin-dependent kinase) bound to AMP-PNP (25), a part of the Aurora-2 activation loop (defined as residues 273–292) is disordered. Only residues 273–278 and 289–292 were clearly visible and have been included in the final model. Residue Thr-288, which is phosphorylated during activation of Aurora-2, belongs to part of the disordered region and was not visible in electron density maps
In the refined crystal structure, a number of residues located at the N and C termini of the kinase domain (residues 107–127 and 389–403, respectively) exhibited poor electron density, and these residues could not be placed in electron density
Accordingly, an expression construct comprising residues 107–403 was used for crystallographic studies. The disordered nature of residues 107–126 in the final crystal structure suggests that this spanning polypeptide linker is particularly long and flexible in Aurora-2

The hydrodynamic (Stokes) radii determined by AUC analyses (Table 1) suggest that the mCRY and mBMAL1 proteins have somewhat elongated shapes and might be at least partially unstructured.

The shorter mBMAL1-(577–625) fragment bound to both mCRYCCtail fragments with a roughly 10 μm affinity (Fig. 2A).
Region 577–625 discussed in the article corresponds to 584-632 in UniProt entry.
In contrast, the longer mBMAL1-(490–625) fragment bound to mCRY1 with an ∼40 μm affinity and to mCRY2 with an ∼10 μm affinity (Fig. 2B).
Region 490–625 discussed in the article corresponds to 497-632 in UniProt entry.
In good agreement with the fluorescence polarization data, mCRY1 and mCRY2 bind to the mBMAL1-(577–625) fragment with a roughly 10 μm affinity (Fig. 3A and Table 3).
Region 577–625 discussed in the article corresponds to 584-632 in UniProt entry.

The 11 initial residues (G38–P48) are invisible due to disorder
Whereas most of the activation loop is disordered in the wild-type and K82R structures (D193–C210), the T208A/S212A mutant reveals five more residues at the end of the activation loop (L206–C210).
The catalytic domain shows the typical features expected for an inactive kinase with a disordered activation loop. 
Like other kinases, MARK family members can be activated by phosphorylation in the “activation loop” which controls the access of the substrate to the catalytic center
Activation of MARK is achieved by phosphorylation of a single residue, T208, by MARKK. It requires S212 to be present, but not phosphorylated, because this phosphorylation is inhibitory.
The overall protein structure is very similar to what has been previously reported (S. Panneerselvam, A. Marx, E.M. Mandelkow, E. Mandelkow
Structure, 14 (2006), p. 173)
The crystallographic structure of the catalytic domain of human MARK2 is very similar to the crystallographic structure of the catalytic domain of rat MARK2 and they both present a disordered activation loop in the inactive state
The crystallographic structure of the catalytic domain of human MARK2 is very similar to the crystallographic structure of the catalytic domain of rat MARK2 and they both present a disordered activation loop in their inactive state
The second major difference is in the activation loop of the kinase, which adopts an ordered and activated structure in the presence of CagA
The LKB1 complex phosphorylates AMPK-related kinases at the activation loop
The 30-residue protein linker between the KH3 and KH4 domains is highly disordered (Fig. 3a), such that in free FBP3/4 the two domains reorient essentially independently of each other (unpublished data), as in the case of other modular proteins connected by long linkers
In the paper the authors included residues 278–447 of human FBP and renumbered them as 5–174
Interdomain motion observed in the FBP3/4–M29 ssDNA complex in which the linkers, both protein and ssDNA, possess intrinsic flexibility, is likely to be an essential component of FBP function. This property can readily accommodate changes in the direction of the DNA.
Whereas clear electron density was observed for LDLR-A1 residues 53–89 and LDLR-A2 residues 129-171, no density was observed for the EGF-like domain (residues 90–128).
The EGF-like domain of CD320 is not visible in our electron density maps despite chemically being present, suggesting positional disorder in the crystal. 
From the statement „Moreover, electron density for the Ca2+ binding residue Glu86 as well as Glu87 and disulfide forming Cys88 (equivalent to Cys89 in wild type) was missing". Besides this small region, the electron density map is missing also for the 90-128 region (as it was observed in the wild type as well (PDB: 4ZRP)).
The linker between the POUS and POUH domains (amino acids 186−229) of HNF1β contains the nuclear localization signal (NLS; 229KKMRRNRFK237) and is even longer than that of HNF1α (by 26 residues) (Figure 1). The majority of the linker is disordered, as also seen in the HNF1α structure.
The N-terminal segment (residues 20–52) of AtLURE1.2 is completely disordered, whereas its C-terminal portion (residues 53–89) adopts a typical structure of plant defensin peptides characterized by cysteine-stabilized αβ-motif (CSαβ)
Therefore, whether and how the N-terminal (residues 21–52) disordered in our structure contributes to AtLURE1.2-induced signaling remain unknown.
The model was extended to a total of 746 residues (residues 1 and 418–460 were not observed in the electronic density) by manual building using the O molecular modeling package.
Residues 448-460 are missing from the PDBs structures
Residues 25–198 of KAP were visible in the electron density map; however, the N-terminal PEST sequence of ~23 residues was disordered.
Residues 23–200 were visible in the electron density maps, and the structure has been refined to final Rwork and Rfree of 20.2% and 25.4%, respectively (Table 2).

As a result, a protein model could not be built for the following disordered regions: residues 2326–2328 (loop I, chain B only), 2344–2360 (loop II, both chains), 2450–2460 (loop III, both chains) and residues 2200–2220 and 2502–2510 on the N and C termini, respectively.

Most of the entire TE domain structure could be fitted into the electron density, except for the three segments and a glycine residue shown in Figs. ​Figs.1,1, ​,2,2, ​,3,3, with missing or weak density, indicating their high mobility. All of the disordered segments are in solvent-exposed regions and nowhere close to being involved in crystal contacts.
The majority of the structure is well defined, with the exception of the disordered activation loop (residues 565–583) and a short loop connecting β2 and β3 (residues 445–446) in the N-terminal domain
The αC helix is rotated away from the C-terminal lobe, and the activation loop is disordered, consistent with a lack of phosphorylation Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4.

Most of the structure is well defined, with the exception of residues 596–603 and 734–738 (the loop connecting β2 and β3) and the activation loop residues 760–883.
The lobes of EphA2 are in the open conformation, and the activation loop is disordered (Figure 2C).

Using the helical numbering of the S. pombe structure, we did not observe electron density corresponding to the hNatA α33 and α34 helices, which are presumably disordered, and the loop-α40-loop segment of the hNaa15 C-terminus is only resolved in one of the protomer subunits due to stabilization by crystal packing.

TRAX also contains several extra loop sequences, of which the N-terminal 30 amino acids and amino acids 157–176 are disordered in the structure.

Upon visual inspection of the crystal structure we identified this region as intrinsically disordered, as described in 21552258
Despite an additional 25 residues in the WT and A123V CtBP1(28–378), only four additional residues are evident in the electron density maps and modeled in our final structures (Fig. 5). These results are consistent with findings on rat CtBP that the C terminus is largely disordered (31).
The P3-1 structure contains a dimer in the asymmetric unit and resolves ∼80% of the amino acids due to a number of disordered loops.
First, loop-1 (L1), which to our knowledge is visible in every C3 and C7 structure solved to date, is disordered in the structure of P3. This includes disorder of Arg64, one of the primary residues responsible for binding the P1 aspartate in caspase substrates.
The P3-1 structure contains a dimer in the asymmetric unit and resolves ∼80% of the amino acids due to a number of disordered loops.
Loop-3 (L3), or the “activation loop,” which forms the primary substrate binding groove in the active enzyme, is pulled out of the active site in both P3 monomers, although one is partially disordered whereas the other is fully resolved (Fig. 1 A and B). This could be caused in part by asymmetric crystal packing contacts that appear to stabilize the single L3 resolved in our structure, although the existing structures of P7 (PDB ID codes 1K88 and 1GQF) also reveal a variety of ordered and disordered L3s, suggesting that this loop samples a large number of conformations in P3 and P7 (8, 9).
The P3-1 structure contains a dimer in the asymmetric unit and resolves ∼80% of the amino acids due to a number of disordered loops.
Residues belonging to loop 2 are not resolved.
The N-terminal His-tag and Steap3 residues 1–28 are not observed in the crystal structure. However, Western blot analyses of the crystallized
material, using anti-His6 antibodies, indicate that these N-terminal residues are indeed present and are therefore disordered in the crystal.
The DExH helicase core of Ski2-ΔN could be built and refined almost in its entirety (with the exception of a disordered region between residues 542 and 606) and included electron density for an AMPPNP molecule.
 With the exception of the exposed and hence mobile reactive centre loop (residues 408-425), the overall results show the complete fold of the human molecule including the full amino-terminal extension with the renin cleavage site (Fig 1a).
The disorder region boundaries differ from the ones mentioned in the article as there is a signal peptide of 33 amino acids not accounted for.
The mouse structures were determined at higher resolution (2.3, 2.1, 2.95Å) but the general features are preserved in the 3.15Å rat and 3.3Å human structures (as shown separately and with statistics in Figure 2 and Table 1 of the Supplementary information).
Although the disordered region in not explicitly mentioned, it is shown in the deposited PDB structure.
The segment from Glu20 to Pro29 (dashed, pale green) is disordered in the structure and modeled for illustration. 
The correct disordered region boundaries also account for angiotensinogen's signal peptide.
The serpin template is in gray, and helix A (hA) is in marine with the A-sheet (sA) in light blue and the disordered RCL in red dashes. 
The disordered region boundaries for the Reactive Center Loop (RCL) are not mentioned but were deposited in PDB.
Subsequently, we prepared spent AGT, where the N-terminal 10-residue angiotensin I peptide was removed from the AGT-N14 expression construct and loop- cleaved AGT, where AGT-N14 was cleaved between Gln412 and Leu413 by thermolysin treatment.
Removal of the N-terminal decapeptide augments the disordered region (evidence in PDB entry)
The fragments without clear electron density are shown with dashed lines for illustration.

The lack of electron density for the not modelled N-terminal 32 residues of the native sequence and two loop regions is very likely due to structural disorder.
As intended, Cys299 does indeed form a disulfide bond in the crystal structure, however, not an intermolecular bond with Cys299 from another subunit, but an intramolecular bond with Cys128 (Figure 4, S8). Both cysteines are located in active- site entrance loops that were found disordered in the “corner subunits” flanking the DmβUP octamer.
Mutation of Thr299 to cysteine, a rather conservative exchange intended to promote formation of an intersubunit disulfide bridge, renders the enzyme incapable of forming higher oligomers.
Our results show that this is synonymous with enzyme inactivation, which is in agreement with our hypothesis that ordering of flexible loops at the active site entrance, triggered by substrate binding, inserts Glu207 into the active site and induces oligomerization, which in turn stabilizes the catalytically active conformation of the interacting subunits by burying these loops between them.

The sequence-divergent
N terminus (M1–N111) comprises a disordered N-terminal extension (M1–V32) and a more domain-like region (Y33–L95).
Iterative rounds of model building with O, refinement with Refmac (Murshudov et al., 1997), and addition of ordered solvent clarified the trace except the N-terminal region, which is not visible in the electron density maps and therefore must be disordered. 
In  the  1.4Å structure,  clear electron density was seen for all residues from Pro6to Lys241,while  in  the  second  form,  residues  Leu148–Arg165 are  disordered.
The long loop between helices h5 and h6 at the foot of CLIC1(Pro147–Gln164) is a distinctive feature of the CLICs. It is highlynegatively charged with seven acidic residues between Pro149and  Glu160in  CLIC1  giving  a  net  charge  of7(cf.a  netnegative  charge  of  6  in  CLIC4  and  p64,  5  in  CLIC2,  5  inparchorin, and 3 in CLIC3). This loop is spatially adjacent tothe loop linking the two domains, and it may be important inprotein-protein interactions.
In the dimer there is no electron density for the first 22 residues (β-strand 1 in monomer), and helix 2 is extended by an extra 2turns   to   include   residues   starting   at   Thr-44   (originally β-strand 2; Fig. 2E).

 The electron density of residues 55–69 could not be observed at the contour level of 1.0 sigma due to the flexibility of this region.
The observed structure consists of residues 16–163 and 173–257 with the break in density corresponding to the flexible foot loop between helix 5 and helix 6 (Fig. 1A, bottom left), which is not ordered in the CLIC4(ext) structure. 
The backbone structures overlay well except for the region around helix 2 (including connecting loops, Leu59 to His74) and the flexible foot loop (Leu159 to Thr175).

The main differences occur in loop regions where the temperature factors are high (e.g. the β3-αC loop and the A-loop)
There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystals and one of these shows a novel A-loop conformation, while the A-loop is not visible in the other owing to disorder.
Superposition of the various structures reported here and one recently reported structure (Levinson et al., 2006; PDB code 2g1t) shows that there are four main regions of conformational flexibility in the Abl kinase domain: the A-loop, the P-loop, the C-helix and the relative position of the N-terminal lobe with respect to the C-terminal lobe
A-loop comprises residues 381-401 but region is defined on the basis of missing residues 385-401 in 2HZ0_B.
There are two molecules in the asymmetric unit of the crystals and one of these shows a novel A-loop conformation, while the A-loop is not visible in the other owing to disorder. The novel
A-loop conformation lies in an intermediate position between the active conformation and the imatinib-bound conformation. The path of this segment departs from the latter conformation at Leu383, superimposes again at Lys400, has Tyr393 exposed at the surface and shows some weak resemblance to the intermediate conformation observed in partially phosphorylated Igf1r kinase (Pautsch et al., 2001). However, this conformation is stabilized by crystal contacts in the Abl structure, so it is not clear if this is really a natural inactive state of the A-loop of Abl kinase.
A-loop comprises residues 381-401 but region is defined on the basis of missing residues 385-401 in 2HZ0_B
In this conformational assay, a strong Val525 NMR signal thus indicates a flexible and unbent helix_I, while average NMR signals indicate an ordered and bent helix_I. Intermediate intensities can result from various degrees of helix I bending and represent the time-averaged percentage of helix_I being in a linear or bent conformation.
Figure 2 displays NMR HSQC spectra of 15N-Val-labeled Abl/imatinib with an unliganded myristate pocket (b), bound to a myristoylated peptide derived from the Abl N-terminus (c), and bound to 1, which has a KD of 6 μM but no inhibitory activity up to 100 μM (d). The flexibility of Val525 in the linear conformation of helix_I (b) or in presence of a fragment that does not allow helix_I bending (d) can clearly be seen in Figure 2. In contrast, the reduction in flexibility upon helix_I bending induced by complexation with the Myr-peptide is shown in Figure 2c. 
Author numbering is based on human c-Abl 1b isoform, which only difers in 3 positions. Since this piece of evidence involves helix_I which is not defined in the publication, for this annotation it is taken as positions 501-512, corresponding to 520-531 in human c-Abl 1b.

We determined the three-dimensional (3D) solution structure of the FABD (corresponding to residues 1026–1149 of human c-Abl spliceform 1b) by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy (Figures 1B and 1C and Table 1). This domain also includes the previously proposed NES (residues 1109–1118) (Taagepera et al., 1998). The ordered region of the FABD, which encompasses residues 1047–1149, is a monomer in solution
15N relaxation data shows that the αIII-αIV loop displays high internal mobility and that the 20 N-terminal residues of the expression construct are unstructured
{1H}-15N heteronuclear NOE, longitudinal and transverse 15N relaxation data of the Bcr-Abl/c-Abl FABD demonstrate significant conformational flexibility for the N-terminal region and the loop between helices αIII and αIV
R-DPH binds to c-Abl in the myristoyl binding site and straightens the αI’ helix to elongate the αI helix (Figure 5A). In chain A, the αI helix extends to residue 519 and in Chain B, the αI helix extends to residue 529. The remaining C-terminal residues of the respective molecules in the asymmetric unit are disordered. In contrast, the autoinhibited c-Abl has αI helix ending at residue 515, with a loop between residues 515–521 and with αI’ helix defined by residues 521–529 (Figure 1). The elongated αI helix of Chain B with R-DPH shows significant crystal packing and is an artifact of crystallization. However, the C terminus of Chain A with R-DPH shows no crystal packing and will be the focus of subsequent discussion.
Residues 520-531 in PDB 3PYY chain A correspond to region 501-512 in the UniProt amino acid sequence of canonical isoform 1A of P00519..
The crystal form has two copies of the KD in the asymmetric unit, however only one SH2 domain could be localized in the electron density map, presumably due to a high degree of disorder in the second SH2 domain. Since the conformation of both KDs is very similar, we focus our interpretation on the molecule for which the SH2 domain could be built. The structure shows the SH2 and KD in an extended conformation (Figure 4A), as was observed previously for the SH3–SH2–KD construct bound to PD166326 (PDB ID: 1OPL) [2]. The previous crystal form, however contained two different conformational states of the SH3–SH2–KD construct, (i) the compact auto-inhibited conformation, in which the SH2 domain docks on to the C-lobe of the KD and (ii) the extended conformation, for which only the SH2 and KDs could be modelled and which was characterized by very high temperature factors.
Missing electron density correspond to crystallography experiment for PDB 4XEY chain B.
In molecule A, the surface loops 671–678, 723–723, 841–857, and 893–899 are disordered, while, in molecule B, residues 672–679, 719–727, 759–766, 894–901, 929–934, and 956 lacked electron density.
The extreme N-terminus of both chains is disordered (residues
85–87), as is the C-terminus of chain A (395–420) and chain B (399–420).
Due to a lack of electron-density, the first 15 residues of hUPP1 and the N-terminal cloning artifact residues 'MRGSHHHHHHGSPGLQEF' were not built.
Another feature is the disordered loop between residues 248–263, which starts after the superposition of the PPT C-terminal domain and AcpS ends, suggesting that this may act as a flexible linker.
The disordered N-terminus of APAF contains the caspase recruitment domain (CARD).
The seven CARDs exhibit no EM density, likely reflecting their dynamic locations.
The disordered N-terminus of APAF contains the caspase recruitment domain (CARD).
We surmise that the three excluded Apaf-1 CARDs are disordered since they are not visible, but they may contribute to the propensity of the particles to aggregate.
The N-terminal module of mPRMT2 (residues 1-106)
partially folded in a SH3 domain is missing in the electron density although present in the crystal.
We reveal that the N-terminal containing SH3 module is
disordered in the full-length crystal structures, and highlight idiosyncratic features of the PRMT2
active site.
Therefore, unlike zPRMT2, the absence of residues 1–106 in the electron density map was not the result of proteolysis before or during the crystallization process, but could be explained by a high flexibility of the N-terminal region within the crystals.
 The electron density map revealed the absence of residues 1-71 corresponding to
the N-terminus part containing the SH3 domain.
We have determined the three-dimensional structure of p23fyp, the TCTP from S. pombe, by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy using a total of 2,254 experimentally determined restraints. Excluding the region Gly 40–Gly 61, which is highly mobile and disordered10, the structure is well defined (Fig. 2a; Table 1). 
N-terminal ectodomain is 54 residues long (excl. N-terminal tag) and is disordered.
The unstructured nature of both N- and C-terminal juxta-membrane regions is supported by the lack of long-range NOEs and analysis of chemical shifts in TALOS-N software (see Figure 2B).
The cytoplasmic domain consists of two parts: an intrinsically disordered juxta-membrane region and a globular C-terminal death domain. The unstructured nature of both N- and C-terminal juxta-membrane regions is supported by the lack of long-range NOEs and analysis of chemical shifts in TALOS-N software (see Figure 2B).
The ordered structure extends from residues Leu-1790 to Glu-1868 and is composed of
four α-helices separated by two short anti-parallel -strands; a less well defined helical region extends from residue Ser-1869 to Arg-1882, and a disordered N-terminal region encompasses residues 1777–1789.
The cis conformation is evidenced by stronger X-Pro Hα-Hα than X-Pro Hα-Hδ NOE contacts and differences of Cβ-Cγ chemical shifts of 9.4 and 8.5 ppm, respectively (59, 60).
Medium range 1 H-1 H NOEs, steady-state {1H}-15N NOE, and 13Cα secondary chemical shifts for NaV1.2 indicate that the CTD forms a well folded domain between residues Leu-1790
and Glu-1868, with a less well ordered region between residues Ser-1869 and Arg-1882 and a disordered N-terminal region between residues Gly-1777 and Pro-1789 (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1).
For Nav1.2, the N-terminal 116 residues, extracellular loop (residues 285-313), intracellular I-II linker (residues 442-739), II-III linker (residues 988-1190), and C-terminal sequences after Ser1786 were not modelled due to the lack of corresponding densities.

The final model contains the NaV1.2 amino acids 1788-1929, FGF13U amino acids 11-158, and the CaM amino acids 7-149. The model was refined to Rwork/Rfree of 21.5/24.6 % (Table 1). 
The PDB evidence shows this region lacks electron density, indicating it is disordered.
(A) Sequence alignment of the NaV1.2 and NaV1.5 CTDs, with structural motifs and the IQ domain indicated. The interaction sites for the CaM N- and C-lobes and the CaM interlobular linker are also indicated.

(D) Overlay of the NaV1.2/Ca2+ and the NaV1.5/Ca2+ structures aligned to the IQ motifs. (E) Overlay of the NaV1.2/Ca2+ structure; the NaV1.5/Ca2+ structure; and the NaV1.5/-Ca2+ structure (Protein Data Bank accession code 4DCK), all aligned to the globular domain of the respective CTDs. For clarity, their respective CaM structures were omitted. This arrangement emphasizes the different angles between the globular domains and the IQ motifs among the three structures.
This newly discovered interaction between the CaM N-lobe and the distal C-terminal portion of the IQ domain is driven mainly through van der Waals forces (Fig. 2E), burying NaV1.2 hydrophobic side chains (Leu1920, Leu1921, Val1925, and Val1928) and has functional and disease-related implications. 
The FHF binds to the CTD globular domain and CaM binds to the IQ domain.
Second, to test the proposed role of Arg1902 in the relayed interactions in NaV1.2 CTD/apoCaM, we measured the affinity of apoCaM for the wild type and Arg1902Cys mutant NaV1.2 CTDs by ITC. Consistent with our hypothesis, the Arg1902Cys mutation reduced affinity of apoCaM for the NaV1.2 CTD significantly (Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4C).
The ITC experiment with the CaM34 mutant showed a reduced affinity for the Arg1902Cys mutant compared to the wild CTD in the presence of Ca2+ (Table 3 and Supplementary Fig. 4E).
All three FHFs bound to the C-terminal regions of Nav1.1, Nav1.2, Nav1.5, Nav1.6, and Nav1.9 (Fig. 3, supplemental Fig. 2, and data not shown).
FIGURE 3. FHFs bind to the C-terminal domain of multiple Nav α subunits. Representative SPR sensorgrams illustrating binding of FHF2A53–245, FHF3A55–225, and FHF4B64 –252 to Nav 1.1CT, Na v 1.2CT, and Nav 1.5CT and binding of FHF2A53–245 and FHF3A55–225 to Nav 1.9CT .
Our data demonstrate that all FHFs, regardless of N-terminal isoform variability, interact directly with the C-terminal domain of multiple Nav α subunits, suggesting that FHFs share a common channel binding site. 
Importantly, the disordered portions of Slu7 (residues 1–61, 197–264, and 372–586) are highly enriched by positively charged amino acids: 62 Arg and Lys residues in total. 
The fine quality of the EM density map allows identification of two large segments of Slu7: residues 62–196 and 265–371 (Table S2).

Untagged collagen X NC1 domain produced in an in vitro expression system is stabilized significantly by the N-terminal segment. The most obvious interpretation of this observation is that a defined structure of the N-terminal segment contributes to NC1 trimer formation, yet this is not observed in our crystals.
Residues 549–680 have clear and continuous electron density; the N-terminal 28 residues and the His6 tag are not visible and are presumed to be disordered.
The EXO domain in GEN1 has a 78 amino acid insertion (residues 245–322), of which only helix α12b (residues 308–322) is ordered in the structure (Figure 1A, gray and Figure 2).
Other sections were less precisely determined; in particular, residues -1 to 9, 65 to 70, 127 to 136, and 173 to 174 did not have convincing density.
This gave a noticeable improvement in the map quality; however, it was still not possible to locate the missing residues, which remain undefined even after refinement.
The asymmetric unit of the structure contains two LOC79017 monomers and 141 water molecules. Several N‐ and C‐terminal residues (residues 1–13 and 183–188 for chain A; residues 1–14 and 184–188 for chain B) were not included in the model due to insufficient electron density. 
The starting Met is missing and the first residue  in the PDB is just a cloning artifact.
The structure comprises a dimer with continuous electron density observable for residues 14–182 in monomer A and residues 15–183 in monomer B as well as 34 water molecules. No electron density is apparent for the NH2-terminal 13 (monomer A) or 14 (monomer B) residues.
No electron density was detected for the residues in the N-terminal segment before Ala10 (Fig. 1A). This region must thus be disordered in structure.

The final model contains residues 24–474 and 492–532 in chain A and residues 24–387, 391–473, and 492–535 in chain B (sup-plemental Fig. S1). Mass spectroscopic analysis of the protein used for crystallization suggests that the missing regions are disordered and not proteolyzed. The missing residues from positions 474/475 to 491 in each chain correspond to the so-called “nucleotide gate” region of the kinase domain (45), which was similarly disordered in structures of GRK2


Despite the statement in the publication that residues 1- 23 are disordered, reviewing of the PDB structure (https://ftp.wwpdb.org/pub/pdb/validation_reports/ac/2acx/2acx_full_validation.pdf.gz) shows three visible residues (14 - 16) in the aforementioned region.

 In the both structures, two loops comprised of residues 155–161 and 176–185 (termed Loops 1 and 2, respectively) of ERGIC-53, which were disordered in the Ca2+-free form.

Due to the poor quality of the MANF electron density maps in the C-terminus region, residues 99–137 were modelled as polyalanine, except for the disulphide bridge between C127 and C130, which was modelled based on density in a sulphur-anomalous map (Fig. 1B). Residues 138–158 are not visible at all.
The region 138-158 in the publication corresponds to region 162-182 because residues 1-24 are not in the crystal.
The N-terminal region (residues 36-53) and the loop connecting helices αAB and αB (residues 97-118) in p31comet could not be located in the final electron density map and are likely disordered.

The construct differs from the canonical sequence as Met108 is a modified residue, i.e. a selenomethionine.
No direct statement on Intrinsic Disorder is given either in the paper or the supplementary information. However, (i) there exists such information within the PDB file (REMARK 465 MISSING RESIDUES) and (ii) the authors clearly state within the manuscript that the N-terminal signal peptide (AAs 1-36) was removed for protein production.
We modeled 1082 of 1204 residues of Exp-5. Several loop regions in the 20 HEAT repeats and 55 residues at the C terminus could not be modeled (details in fig. S1), and 13 residues at the C terminus were modeled as a polyalanine a helix.
The N-terminal residue 1, residues 474-490 in the loop of HEAT12, residues 705-706 in the loop of HEAT14, residues 938-951 in the loop of HEAT17 and residues 980-1069 in the loop between HEAT17 and HEAT18 are disordered in the crystal. Out of 68 C-terminal residues, 55 residues were not modeled because of disordered structure, and 13 residues were built as a poly-alanine α-helix because of high temperature factor.
This feature corresponds to the IDR in the loop of HEAT10 as shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. The respective author statement, taken from the legend of Fig. S1, erroneously refers to the loop for HEAT12. See Supplementary Fig. S1 for more details.

The last 25 C-terminal residues (residues 1,180–1,204) could not be traced in all three Exp-5 structures (Figure 1E).
Figure 1E. The secondary structure of the C-terminal area of Exp-5 alone and Exp-5 complexes. C-terminal 1,180–1,204 residues (light gray) are not shown in all Exp-5 structures.
On the other hand, the last 25 ‘‘C-terminal end’’ (residues 1,180–1,204) might not be keenly involved in the stabilization of the protein based on X-ray structures because C-terminal end residues showed no electron density for Exp-5 structures at three states: Exp-5 alone, the binary complex, and the ternary complex. Interestingly, the C-terminal end has shown important biological functions involved in the binding and/or recognition of pre-miRNAs as cargo substrate (Melo et al., 2010).

The interaction site of the C-terminal anchor with HEATs 4–9 in Exp-5 alone overlaps with the RanGTP binding site at the N-terminal HEATs of Exp-5 of the binary complex. The interaction between the C-terminal anchor and the N-terminal HEATs of Exp-5 is likely to be important in stabilizing the closed conformation of Exp-5 alone.
The 'C-terminal anchor' segment is ordered in the monomeric form of Exp-5 (5YU7), while it is disordered in the oligomeric forms Exp-5:RanGTP (5YU7), Exp-5:RanGTP:pre-miRNA (PDB:3A6P, PMID:19965479).

To accommodate RanGTP, intramolecular interaction between the C-terminal anchor and HEATs 4–9 of Exp-5 should be removed (Figure 3). For this motion, a notable key region is in the last 24 amino acids at the C-terminal end of Exp-5.

Them4 and Them5 proteins contain a highly variable sequence stretch (ca. residues 83 to 109 and ca. residues 91 to 114 for Them4 and Them5, respectively) that is partially disordered in both crystal structures.
PDB structure (https://files.rcsb.org/pub/pdb/validation_reports/ae/4ae7/4ae7_full_validation.pdf) shows that region 102-111 is disordered.
Twenty-five amino acids from the N-terminus in the crystal structure, which was interpretable and used to build a structural model of residues L26 to Y172, were not modeled because of high flexibility. 
However, it was not possible to model the first 13 residues of the N-terminal extension of βB2-N, nor linker residues 85 to 88, in either molecule of βB2-N, suggesting a disordered conformation for the N-terminal extension and residues 85 to 88.
Due to a disorder, residues 1–10 and 133–143 are not modeled in the final structure.
Additionally, due to a lack of the interpretable electron density peaks, residues 1–10 and 133–143 of ATF and 108–111, 134–138, and 248–251 of suPAR 2345 are not included in the final model.
The disordered region described in the publication comprises residues 1-10 which maps to region 21-30 of the UniProt amino acid sequence, since the latter includes a natural signal peptide (1-20) that is cleaved in the mature protein.

The N-terminal region (residues 1–34) and three loops comprising residues 124–140, 761–768, and 928–935 in the structure of ZmPEPC show little or no electron density (Figure 1E). Since there was no significant cleavage, as judged by SDS-PAGE [17], it is apparent that the three loops exist in multiple conformations, whereas only the N-terminal region is partially truncated.
Although we used the OPTN CC2-UBAN region for crystallization experiments, the electron density for the majority of the CC2 region in all OPTN molecules was very weak and thus we modelled only the UBAN motif with some extensions on both sides (residues 445–505 for the longest chain).
The final refined model contains residues 58–196, 211–303 for chain A and 57–196, 211–304 for chain B.
The refined model of Csp7 contains a complete catalytic unit comprising two p20–p10 heterodimers. The p20 and p10 polypeptide chains are composed of residues 57–196 and 212–302, respectively. 
The final atomic model contains residues 55–196 and 211–303 from the first caspase-7 protomer, residues 58–196 and 211–303 from the second caspase-7 protomer, and residues 134–150 for both bound XIAP linkers.
The narrow signal linewidth and small
chemical shift dispersion observed in the 1
H-15N-correlated
(HSQC) NMR spectrum reveal that the C-terminal argininerich region, required for TAP binding (Figure 1A and below),
is unstructured and highly flexible.
A similar analysis was undertaken with 9G8 and it was
shown that a short arginine-rich peptide (aa 81–98), which
lies between the RRM and the zinc-knuckle, was sufficient
for interaction with TAP-p15 (Figure 4D–F). Within this
sequence, the arginine dipeptides at positions 87, 88 and
97, 98 were required for the interaction, whereas Arg 90, 93
were not. These data indicate that 9G8 and SRp20 harbor
a TAP-binding motif, which consists of an arginine-rich
peptide, which from the NMR analysis, appears flexible and
is tightly juxtaposed with their RRMs.
This poly-E region is inferred by the curator to be disordered, based on MobiDB-Lite and according to experimental evidence demonstrating that poly-E repeats display random-coil-like conformation (PMID:16949547)

The construct of hSuv3 used for crystallization contained

fragments of the N- and C-termini (residues 46–57 and 690–

 Residues 257-268 in Izumo122-268 are disordered suggesting that the linker region between the Ig-like domain and the transmembrane domain is highly flexible.
The Izumo122-268 structure superimposes well with Izumo122-254 (rmsd 1.0-Å over all atoms) (Supplementary Fig. 4). However, no electron density was observed after residue 256, suggesting that the linker region following the Ig-like domain is flexible.
Moreover, DXMS experiments performed
on Izumo1 alone indicated a high level of exchange in the hinge region, thus suggesting
dynamic flexible motion within this region. Upon Juno binding, deuterium exchange of
residues 127-140 in the hinge region was reduced by >50%, which is more than the
reduction seen by residues at the Izumo1-Juno interface (Fig. 4). The strong level of H/D
protection is due to the formation of 10 additional main chain hydrogen bonds within
residues 127-140 of the hinge region. This suggests that the Izumo1 hinge region is
stabilized in a “locked” upright position in the presence of Juno
A disordered loop between the β1 and β2 strands of the Juno20-228 is shown with a black dashed line. 
The region corresponding to residues 111-122 corresponds to a missing residues region in the 5F4Q PDB structure
The human JUNO L2 region, which corresponds to the inhibitory loop in FRs11, is disordered (Fig. 2b), possibly due to a 6–7 amino acid insertion not present in other species (Extended Data Figs 1 and 2)

NMR titrations showed that the unmodified SR-peptide strongly interacts with polyU
SRPK1-phosphorylation resulted in two species, a single phosphorylation at S188 (Fig. 4b, middle) and a di-phosphorylated state, which is heterogeneously phosphorylated at four different serines (Fig. 4b, bottom; Supplementary Fig. 7). NMR titrations showed that the unmodified SR-peptide strongly interacts with polyU, but not when it is phosphorylated at S188 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 4b). LLPS experiments further demonstrated that phosphorylation of full-length NSARS-CoV-2 by SRPK1 changes its RNA-induced phase separation behavior (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 8). The maximum of RNA- induced turbidity was shifted to lower polyU-concentrations for SRPK1-phosphorylated NSARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4c). In addition, fluorescently labeled RNA was less recruited to droplets formed by SRPK1-phosphorylated NSARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4d). In agreement with an attenuated interaction of NSARS-CoV-2 with RNA upon SRPK1-phosphorylation, we also observed a more rapid diffusion of SRPK1-phosphorylated NSARS-CoV-2 inside of polyU-induced droplets when compared to the unmodified protein (Fig. 4e). On the other hand, SRPK1-phosphorylated NSARS-CoV-2 still co-localized with stress granules (Fig. 4d).
The evidence refers to phosphorylated serine pS188.

The two globular domains of the protein (NTD and CTD) have been investigated while no high-resolution information is available yet for the flexible regions of the protein. We focus here on the 1-248 construct which comprises two disordered fragments (IDR1 and IDR2) in addition to the N-terminal globular domain (NTD) and report the sequence-specific assignment of the two disordered regions, a step forward towards the complete characterization of the whole protein.
In this frame, we provide here the backbone assignment of the two disordered regions flanking the NTD, the N-terminal IDR1 and the serine-rich disordered region IDR2, in the 1–248 residue construct (IDR1-NTD-IDR2).
The 2D HN spectrum recorded on the IDR1-NTD-IDR2 (1–248) construct of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein N is shown in Fig. 2. The 2D HN spectrum clearly shows a set of well-resolved NMR signals deriving from the globular NTD domain, as one can verify by superimposing the available sequence-specific assignment (BMRB 34511, Dinesh et al. 2020). In addition, a set of signals, with smaller dispersion and higher intensity, are observed. These are expected to originate from the flexible and disordered fragments of the protein (black contours in Fig. 2).
This region corresponds to IDR1.

This region corresponds to IDR2 and links the NTD and CTD domains.
This corresponds to values of persistence length (see SI) equal to 4.5 ± 0.4 and 4.3 ± 0.4 Å for the Gaussian and SAW distribution, respectively, which are similar to values reported for another unfolded protein under native conditions44–46,50. Overall, these results confirm the NTD is disordered, as predicted by sequence analysis.
We next turned to the linker (LINK FL) construct to investigate how the disordered region modulates the interaction and dynamics between the two folded domains.
This reconfiguration time is compatible with high internal friction effects, as observed for other unstructured proteins44,45, but may also account for the drag of the surrounding domains.
The RNA-binding domain (RBD) and dimerization domains are interconnected by a flexible disordered linker (LINK).
Finally, we again applied single-molecule FRET (Fig. 4A) and ns-FCS (Fig. 4B) to understand the conformational behavior of the CTD FL construct. Single-molecule FRET experiments again reveal a single population with a mean transfer efficiency of 0.59 ± 0.03 (Fig. 4A) and the denaturant dependence follows the expected trend for a disordered region, with a shift of the transfer efficiency toward lower values (Figs. 4C, S6 and S8), from 0.59 to 0.35.
Similar to deletion of the folded CTD, deletion of the linkerIDR dramatically reduces formation of droplets and turbidity associated with LLPS in both conditions (Fig 5A–C).
In summary, these data suggest that in the presence of RNA, the NIDR, the linkerIDR, and the folded CTD form protein–protein and/or protein–RNA contacts important for the multivalent interactions stabilizing in vitro LLPS of N.

Regarding the disordered regions, we found that deletion of the NIDR modestly enhanced droplet formation and turbidity in the absence of RNA (Fig 5A and B), while, in the presence of RNA, phase separation is strongly decreased (Fig 5A and C).

Nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 associates with stress granules.
a. Alexa Fluor 488 labeled N(SARS-CoV-2) (green) colocalizes with the stress granule marker G3BP1 (red) in arsenite-treated digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells.
FRAP of SG-associated N(SARS-CoV-2) suggested the presence of three N(SARS-CoV-2) populations (Fig. 2b): a very mobile with rapid fluorescence recovery, a slower diffusing component, and an immobile fraction, which does not recover its fluorescence after photobleaching (Fig. 2c). Because SGs consists of a rigid core and a dynamic shell, we attribute the different N(SARS-CoV-2) diffusion properties to the localization of N(SARS-CoV-2) to different sub-structures of SGs.
The RNA-binding domain (RBD) and dimerization domains are interconnected by a flexible disordered linker (LINK).
N is a 419 amino acid multidomain protein, comprising two folded, RNA-binding and dimerization domains spanning residues 45-175 and 264-365 respectively. The remaining 164 amino acids are predicted to be intrinsically disordered, but there is currently no atomic resolution information describing their behaviour. Here we assign the backbone resonances of the first two intrinsically disordered domains (N1, spanning residues 1-44 and N3, spanning residues 176-263).

We then determined the crystal structure of six HLA-A*02:01-SARS-CoV-2 complexes, providing the first description of CD8+ T cell SARS-CoV-2 epitopes at an atomic level. Interestingly, three of our selected peptides have since been shown to be immunogenic (N219-227 (Isabel Schulien et al., 2021), N222-230 (Ferretti et al., 2020; Isabel Schulien et al., 2021), and N316-324 (Habel et al., 2020; Isabel Schulien et al., 2021)) in COVID-19 recovered individuals. As expected, these immunogenic peptides were able to form a stable complex with the HLA-A*02:01 molecule.
Overall, we demonstrate that not all selected peptides were able to form stable complexes with HLA-A*02:01, which was a consequence of unfavourable P2 and/or PΩ residues and an important factor for immunogenicity. In addition, we saw limited pre-existing CD8+ T cell response for these peptides in unexposed donors, whereas peptides that have subsequently been shown to be immunogenic in COVID-19 recovered patients were stable and adopted a canonical conformation in the cleft of HLA-A*02:01. Altogether, our data provide molecular insight into CD8+ T cell epitopes from SARS-CoV-2.

Two peptides, N138-146 and N159-167, were not immunogenic in COVID-19-recovered individuals (Isabel Schulien et al., 2021), whereas three peptides, namely N219-227 (Isabel Schulien et al., 2021), N222-230 (Isabel Schulien et al., 2021), and N316-324 (Isabel Schulien et al., 2021; Habel et al., 2020), were immunogenic in COVID-19 recovered individuals, further highlighting the importance of further investigation into these epitopes.
The most stable pHLA complexes were the one with the N222-230 (Tm of 55°C) and N316-324 (Tm of 49°C) peptides, followed by the one with N219-227, N226-234, and N351-359 peptides with a Tm of ~40°C (Table 1, Figure S1). Surprisingly, the Tm was ~35°C for complexes with the NTD-derived peptides N138-146 and N159-167, an extremely low Tm value for pHLA-A*02:01 complexes (Valkenburg et al., 2016; Blaha et al., 2019; Khan et al., 2000).
The three peptides that resulted in a pHLA complex with a Tm above 40°C were recently described as immunogenic in COVID-19-recovered patients (N219-227 (Isabel Schulien et al., 2021), N222-230 (Ferretti et al., 2020; Isabel Schulien et al., 2021), and N316-324 (Habel et al., 2020; Isabel Schulien et al., 2021)), whereas the two peptides leading to a pHLA with a Tm below 40°C were described as non-immunogenic (N138-146 and N159-167 (Isabel Schulien et al., 2021)) (Table 1). This suggests that indeed pHLA complex stability may play a role in peptide immunogenicity.

SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells exhibited functional characteristics comparable to influenza-specific CD8+ T cells and were detectable in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals who were seronegative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies targeting spike (S) and nucleoprotein (N). These results define cross-reactive and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses as potentially important determinants of immune protection in mild SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Based on Figure 1d, region 222-230 is an immunogenic peptide toward HLA-A-.
We characterized the interactions between sdAbs and N‐protein using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). We first tested their binding to the FLN. Four out of six sdAbs showed clear binding. The Kd values of positive sdAb‐N2, sdAb‐N3, sdAb‐N5, and sdAb‐N6 are 1.75 µm, 4.37 µm, 3.97 µm, and 3.53 µm, respectively (Fig. 2). Next, we tested the binding of these four sdAbs with NLC protein. Only sdAb‐N2 and sdAb‐N3 showed positive results with Kd values of 2.24 µm and 1.09 µm, respectively (Fig. 3), indicating that the binding of sdAbs‐N5 and sdAb‐N6 requires the presence of the N‐arm or C‐tail of N‐protein.

Removal of the Narm and Carm (NNTD-LKR-CTD) results in two major species that are similar to NWT. However, both NNTD-LKR-CTD populations display reduced polydispersity (narrower peak width, Figure S2A), suggesting that both Narm and Carm contribute to N oligomerization.

Furthermore, the Narm and Carm may contribute more to slRNA binding than ssRNA because the impact on N binding is more pronounced after removal of the Narm or Carm (Figure S3C).

Truncation of the Narm results in an increase of the RNA-free peak (p3), suggesting that N truncations can alter the structure of N and correspondingly impact RNA binding and oligomerization. When both Narm and Carm were removed, we observed an even greater shift to p3, suggesting that both arms contribute to RNA-binding interactions.

When both Narm and Carm were removed, we observed an even greater shift to p3, suggesting that both arms contribute to RNA-binding interactions.
To determine if N regions that impact RNA binding also impact liquid droplet formation, we next examined the role of Narm and Carm. NNTD-LKR-CTD-Carm behaves similarly to NWT, having loose coils in p1 (Figure 4B, middle left) and forming spherical liquid droplets in p2 (Figure 4B, middle right). However, examination of p2 from NNTD-LKR-CTD (Figure 4B, bottom right) revealed a much smaller population of liquid droplets (red arrow) and mostly crystal-like needle aggregates, suggesting that the Carm is important for droplet formation. A transition from spherical liquids to needle-like solids is consistent with the liquid-to-solid transitions observed for other proteins that undergo phase separation (Patel et al., 2015).
N-terminal Segment of RcsF Is Disordered
The protein that was used for crystallization was expressed as a soluble protein containing a C-terminal His tag and lacking the first 16 residues corresponding to the signal peptide and the lipobox (remember that RcsF is a lipoprotein whose lipid moiety is anchored in the outer membrane). However, the observed electron density begins at residue Pro48, suggesting that about 30 residues in the N-terminal part of the protein are completely disordered. The integrity of the sequence of the purified protein was confirmed using mass spectrometry to rule out any nonspecific proteolytic cleavage of the protein during expression and purification. The measured average mass was 13,609  2 Da, which is in good agreement with a theoretical average mass of 13,612 Da taking into account the complete processing of the N-terminal methionine.
Therefore, we decided to study the ability of a truncated version of the protein (RcsFtrunc), corresponding to residues Pro48 to Lys134, to induce the Rcs phosphorelay when expressed in the periplasm, using strain mucoidity as a read-out. As explained in the Introduction, induction of the Rcs system leads to colanic acid production, which results in a distinctive mucoid phenotype. As indicated in Table 2, we observed that expression of RcsFtrunc leads to a mucoid phenotype comparable with that observed when wild-type RcsF is expressed unanchored in the periplasm (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, we can conclude from this experiment that the fraction of the polypeptide chain that is disordered in the crystal is not required for signaling, at least when RcsF is expressed as a soluble protein in the periplasm.

The N-terminal region of PRKRIP1 is disordered, as referenced in Table S2 and confirmed upon visual inspection of the structure.
The C-terminal region of PRKRIP1 is disordered, as referenced in Table S2 and confirmed upon visual inspection of the structure.

Theexperimental map was of sufficient quality to build from residues 13 tothe carboxyl terminus of each non-identical, 440 amino acid polypeptidewith 23 residues missing from the Fhit domain of one molecule and 30residues  missing  from  the  other.
These 23 amino acids corresponds to the protein region comprised between residues 404 and 422, approximately, as indicated in PDB:1EMS and disorder predictors as MobiDB
The Met1 to Gly6 residues at the
N-terminal end, Ile52 and Gly53 following TM1, and Glu370 to
the C-terminal end were not assigned due to the disorder of
the structure.
Approximately 20 residues at the C-terminal end are missing and
may possibly account for the cytoplasmic bobble found in
INX-6dN.
Dashed lines indicate unassigned residues due to disorder.
Dashed lines in figure 2 are located at the end of TM1, and at the C- and N-terminus end region.
The antiparallel E2 beta sheets mostly disappeared, and the hairpin loop was disordered from R252 to D261
The E1 outer lobe contained relaxed and disordered residues from D87 to V100, which
prevent the E1 outer lobe from interfacing with the opposed hemichannel
Lower thermostability may be partially due to increased flexibility of N- and C-terminal segments. In fact, the N-terminus could not be localized in the 3D structure, and for one monomer, the C-terminus was also missing from the density maps.
Sulfolobus SSB lacks the zinc finger motif found in the eucaryal and euryarchaeal proteins, possessing instead a flexible C-terminal tail, sensitive to trypsin digestion, that is not required for DNA binding.
This allowed the unambiguous identification of the site of cleavage by trypsin as Arg-119, the first arginine present in the Gly/Pro-rich C-terminal region, suggesting that the C-terminal 30 amino acids of Sulfolobus SSB exist in a flexible conformation.
Figure 1b shows the assigned 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the 15N, 13C labelled trappin-2. As expected, the dispersion of the resonances shows that the elafin domain (A39-Q95) is well folded whereas the cementoin domain (A1-K38) shows a narrow profile with chemical shift values close to random coil values which is typical for an intrinsically disordered domain.
Our results strongly suggest that the cementoin domain is disordered in the context of the full length protein (not just as the isolated form) under our experimental conditions.
In the Upf1-RNA-ADP:AlF4 complex, there is no ordered electron density for the 13-residue linker that would connect the last residue of the CH domain (Thr212y) to the first residue of the stalk (Ile225y). The two ordered ends of the CH and helicase regions are located on the same side of the molecule at a distance of 30 A˚ from each other, which can be spanned by the disordered and flexible linker.
The linker with no ordered electron density consists of 12 residues.

The final model of Ca2+-bound S100A4 exhibits good stereochemistry and consists of 176 amino acids (dimer in the asymmetric unit), 51 water molecules and four calcium ions.
In S100A4, the C-terminal loop is long and very basic and makes it unique in comparison to other S100 proteins; however, in the Ca2+-bound S100A4 crystal structure the C-terminal loop (Phe89-Lys101) was disordered in the electron density maps.
Region 91-101 is disordered in the structure.
The first 13 residues, including the O-glycosylation site, Thr5, are disordered in the crystal. Although the first N-terminal residue of our model (Cysl4) is well defined in electron density (Figure 1), no electron density is present for the adjacent N terminal residues.
Although at this temperature thermal disorder should be minimal, no density corresponding to the missing amino acids was observed. This indicates that residues 1-13 are statically disordered in the crystal.
HLIT and the C-type lectins differ at two levels: the extreme conformational flexibility of the N-terminal segment of HLIT (residues 1-13) and the lack of both calcium- and carbohydrate-binding sites.
The IDR characterized in the publication and spanning residues 1-13 corresponds to region 23-35 of the amino acid sequence, since the natural precursor form of the protein contains a signal peptide (1-22).
The N-terminal domain is a 13-residue peptide chain that stretches out of the heart shape of the C-type lectin domain. Three residues (positions 9–11) are involved in a helix turn motif that represented the only secondary element of this domain. As a result, the N-terminal domain was much more agitated in the crystal (averaged B-factor of 36 Å2) than the rest of the protein (averaged B-factor of 22 Å2).
The IDR characterized in the publication and spanning residues 1-13 corresponds to region 23-35 of the amino acid sequence, since the natural precursor form of the protein contains a signal peptide (1-22).
During structure refinement, we observed a large electron density around Thr5, clearly indicating the presence of O-linked sugars to the Thr5 side chain.
The O-glycosylation site (Thr5) characterized in the publication corresponds to Thr27 in the amino acid sequence, since the natural precursor form of the protein contains a signal peptide (1-22).
The CD spectrum (Fig. 2) was typical of a random coil structure (28) and strengthened our x-ray data. The negative band near 200 nm had an intensity in the range of those observed with model peptides with no steric constraints or internal hydrogen bonds. Random coil CD spectra were characterized by an intense negative band at 200 nm due to π-π* transition and low intensity bands near 210 nm due to n- π* transitions (28). No typical secondary structures could be deduced from this spectrum. Similar results were obtained in trifluoroethanol or SDS (data not shown). Both x-ray and CD experiments therefore suggest that pE1R11 is a highly flexible molecule that can display many configurations depending on the environment.
The authors also used a synthetic peptide which is almost identical to the first 11 residues (the 1. residue is different). The peptide sequence corresponds to region 23-33 of the amino acid sequence, since the natural precursor form of the protein contains a signal peptide (1-22).
The glycosylated aminoterminal undecapeptide generated by limited trypsin hydrolysis inhibited CaCO, crystal growth with a Kd = 3.0x10e6 mol/L, similar to that of lithostathine. On the contrary, the carboxy-terminal polypeptide was inactive. A synthetic undecapeptide identical to the N-terminal end but not glycosylated was equally active. The activity disappeared upon digestion of the undecapeptide with V8 protease. The N-terminal undecapeptide of lithostathine is therefore essential to the inhibitory activity of the protein on CaCO, crystal growth.
As shown on Figure 2A, the rate of disappearance of calcium from the solution containing seed crystals was decreased in the presence of lithostathine. The N-terminal undecapeptide of lithostathine and its synthetic analogue showed similar activity (Figures 2B and 3).
We studied in vitro the inhibitory properties of human lithostathine on CaCO, precipitation. The inhibitory activity was localized to the amino-terminal undecapeptide of the molecule.
On the contrary, the undecapeptide had retained the inhibitory properties of lithostathine, with a similar Kd for CaCO, crystals (3.0 x 10-6 mol/L). Abolition of inhibition after treating the peptide with protease V8, which generates three fragments, suggested that the glycan chain was not responsible by itself for the inhibition. Actually, it might not be involved at all, because a synthetic peptide with the sequence of the undecapeptide but without glycan was equally active, with a Kd of 4.1 X 10-6 mol/L (Figure 3B).
The authors used two undecapeptides (one of them was glycosylated), which are almost identical to the first 11 residues (the 1. residue is different) of the mature protein. The peptide sequence corresponds to region 23-33 of the amino acid sequence, since the natural precursor form of the protein contains a signal peptide (1-22).
The structures were solved by molecular replacement using the RRM1-2·poly(A)11 crystal structure (PDB code 1cvj). The C-termini of both structures are disordered. The final model of the orthorhombic crystal form includes residues G99-S175. The final model of the trigonal crystal form includes residues G99-E178.
Overlay of the ternary complex with the free RRM2 domain shows the absence of the C-terminal helix α3 in the unliganded forms (Figure S3B). Residues 179 to 199 are disordered in both crystal forms in the absence of RNA but form an α-helix in the ternary complex.
Our NMR and crystallography studies (Figure S3) have suggested that the linkers connecting the RRM domains are flexible in the absence of RNA. As the result of this flexibility, the RRM domains are free to adopt different orientations.
The final PABP RRM1/2–RNA model consists of 53 water molecules and 8 protein–nucleic acid complexes: complex A, PABP residues 11–179 plus nucleotides Ade-1- to Ade-8;…
As suggested for the domain linker between RRM1 and RRM2, we believe that the RRM2/3 and RRM3/4 domain linkers are disordered in the absence of RNA.
Our NMR and crystallography studies (Figure S3) have suggested that the linkers connecting the RRM domains are flexible in the absence of RNA. As the result of this flexibility, the RRM domains are free to adopt different orientations.
According to Figure 1, the RRM2/3 linker includes residues 176-190. Linker residues 179-190 are disordered in the structures (PDB: 4F25 and 4F26).
Helices following RRM1 (residues 92–96) and RRM2 (residues 176–183) contribute to RNA binding. R94 makes hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl oxygen (O20) of the ribose moieties rA5 and rA6 while R179 forms hydrogen bonds with the phosphate oxygens of rA2.
In the α helices, key arginine residues, Arg94 in the first helix and Arg179 in the second, contribute to poly(A) binding by forming hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl oxygen (O2) of the ribose moieties of rA5 and rA6 and the backbone phosphate oxygen of rA2 (Figures 3D and 3E). 
Linker residues 179-190 are disordered in the structures (PDB: 4F25 and 4F26) and residues 179-183 contribute to RNA binding (PDB: 4F02).
The importance of this second helix, which was not observed in the binary complex, was quantified by measuring the RNA binding affinity of a fragment (RRM1-2ΔR) that lacks the 13 C-terminal residues. ITC measurements revealed a 2.7-fold loss of affinity of RRM1-2ΔR (1.6 mM) relative to the larger crystallized fragment (Kd 0.6 mM; Figure S1B).
Linker residues 179-190 are disordered in the structures (PDB: 4F25 and 4F26).
Analysis of the scattering profiles using the program GNOM (Svergun, 1992) shows that the radius of gyration (Rg) of RRM1-2-3 is significantly larger for the poly(A)- bound form than without RNA (Table S2). The ab initio models of RRM1 2-3 generated by the software DAMMIF (Volkov and Svergun, 2003) show that the poly(A)-bound form of RRM1-2-3 in solution is more extended with a longer maximum dimension (Dmax) than the unbound RRM1-2-3 (Figures 5A and 5B and Table S2). Our NMR and crystallography studies (Figure S3) have suggested that the linkers connecting the RRM domains are flexible in the absence of RNA. As the result of this flexibility, the RRM domains are free to adopt different orientations. Our SAXS data show that this leads to a more compact conformation. In contrast, upon binding to poly(A), the linkers between the RRMs fold into a helices (Figure S3), leading to a more extended conformation (Figures 5A and 5B).
According to Figure 1, the RRM2/3 linker includes residues 176-190. Linker residues 179-190 are disordered in the structures (PDB: 4F25 and 4F26).
Comparison of solution and crystal conformations of RRM1-2 reveals the structural basis for the cooperativity. Poly(A) RNA enhances the interaction of PABP and eIF4G through interdomain allostery. This allostery arises from the flexible linkers that connect the RRM domains of PABP. In the absence of RNA, the linkers are flexible and the RRM domains adopt a compact conformation in solution, stabilized by interdomain interactions. This conformation has low affinity for eIF4G. In the presence of RNA, the linkers form a helices, which stabilize the open conformation of PABP and increase the affinity for eIF4G.
According to Figure 1, the RRM2/3 linker includes residues 176-190. Linker residues 179-190 are disordered in the structures (PDB: 4F25 and 4F26).
The final PABP RRM1/2–RNA model consists of 53 water molecules and 8 protein–nucleic acid complexes: complex A, PABP residues 11–179 plus nucleotides Ade-1- to Ade-8;…
Residues 1-10 are completely missing in all chains and are presumably disordered.
Dashed lines indicate regions not observed in the electron density map.
The current model contains two Vav1 CADPZ monomers (labeled A and B,respectively) in the asymmetric unit with backbone root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) of 0.13 A ̊for residues 2–129, 142–150, 156–180, 189–417,419–456, 463–478, 482–564.

A long loop between SN4 and SN5 domains (residues 635–644) was disordered without visible electron density.

The conserved loop L9 (residues 219–224) is poorly ordered in all structures, although it is in the vicinity of the long linker connecting the two interacting regions of UPF2.
However, the first part of this linker (1130–1145) has certain conserved features and is partially visible in the electron density in the vicinity of residues 219–224 of UPF1 loop L9, suggesting that both these regions may be involved in additional interactions at some stage during complex assembly.
Residues 219–228 are disordered in the unbound structure and become partially ordered in the UPF2-bound form (PDB 2WJV). The sequence in the PDB corresponds to isoform 2 of protein UPF1.

Residues 25–693 and 23–693 have been modeled for subunits A and B, respectively (Fig. 1a), with the exception of some flexible regions with no electron density in chain A (35–36, 79–85, 121–127, 312–321) and in chain B (123–125, 312–321).
For Gαq, we were only able to build a model for residues 217–359 due to the weaker cryoEM map density in the N-terminal region compared to Gαi1.
The majority of the Ras-like domain residues of both Gαi1 (residues 32–54 and 193–354) and Gαq (residues 217–359) were also unambiguously modeled in these maps.
As expected, the secondary structure elements are highly conserved between the two structures, and most of the changes occur in flexible loops connecting them (Fig. 2a, b, and d). Closer inspection of MALT1 and comparison with caspases reveal that the enzyme, albeit in its dimeric form and without the requirement of further processing to be active, has crystallized in an inactive state: loop L2 (residues 463–485), which carries the active-site cysteine C464 and forms the linker between the large and small subunits in caspases, appears flexible in MALT1 with residues 467–480 completely disordered in the electron density.
Binding of the covalent peptidic inhibitor induces the active conformation of MALT1. This transition involves structural changes especially in the loops L2, L3, and, to a lesser extent, L4, which delineate the active site but propagate throughout the molecule (Fig. 2a and d). Most prominently, loop L2, which is disordered in the inactive state of ligand-free MALT1, can be fully traced in the electron density of the inhibitor-bound structures.
PDB:3V55 and PDB:3V4O corresponds to the crystal structures of human MALT1(334-719) in its ligand free form and of of human MALT1 (caspase domain) in complex with an irreversible peptidic inhibitor, respectively.

The intervening loop between the paracaspase domain and Ig domain, which extends from strand β6 of the caspase-like fold to helix α1 of the Ig fold, is likely flexible in solution as it is partially disordered in the crystal structure (Fig. 1B).
The intervening peptide sequences between the paracaspase domain and the Ig fold are disordered and are represented here as gray dotted lines.

Residues 313–316, 468–470 and 498–553 for ASPL-C and residues 1–20, 428–432 and 462–472 for p97-ND1 were disordered and therefore not visible in the electron density.

"Gray lines, framed by slanted lines, indicated sections of ceClp1 that are not included in  the crystal structure."
The N-terminal 20 residues of ClpS are not visible in the crystal structures; the removal of the first 17 residues produces ClpSΔN, which binds to the ClpA N-domain but no longer inhibits ClpA activity.
In the trigonal crystal, 87 out of 106 residues in ClpS can be seen in the two NCS-related heterodimers; the missing residues are from the N terminus.
The N-terminal residues from 21 to 26 extend out of the top of the cone, but residues 1–20 were not all visible.
The N-terminal chain of ClpS extends along the N-domain parallel to helix H3 until the density disappears; this configuration would probably place the missing residues near the C terminus of the N-domain and away from the acidic loop connecting the two halves (Fig. 2A).
The N-terminal 20 residues of ClpS are not visible in the crystal structures; the removal of the first 17 residues produces ClpSΔN, which binds to the ClpA N-domain but no longer inhibits ClpA activity.
When the N-terminal 17 amino acids of ClpS were removed by lysylendopeptidase C treatment, the resulting ClpSΔN could still bind to ClpA and the isolated N-domain of ClpA (Fig. 1, A and B); however, ClpSΔN was no longer able to inhibit proteolytic activity of ClpAP. Table III shows that both casein and green fluorescent protein-SsrA degradation were unaffected by ClpSΔN.
The structure of the complex crystallized in tetragonal space group was solved by molecular replacement using the refined model of the orthorhombic space group. Although this structure could be refined at 2.3 Å resolution to a crystallographic R-factor of 25.2 (Rfree = 29.4%), several residues were not visible, namely the N-terminal residues of ClpS (1–22) and three residues in the N-domain of ClpA (73–75).
In the final structure, five residues of ClpS (16–20) and three residues in ClpA161 (73–75) were replaced with Ala because they showed only main chain density. The final structure consists of 146 of the 161 residues from ClpA161, 91 of 106 residues from ClpS and 49 ordered solvent molecules.
The N-terminal region of ClpS is poorly defined; the first 15 residues are not visible in the electron density maps, and the next 13 residues (16–28), although present, form an extended coiled protein chain.
There are several disordered regions in the ClpA structure; all of them are loops connecting secondary structure elements or between domains (Fig. 1b).
The electron density for the 25 residues connecting the N-domain and D1 was not visible, but we were able to identify the cognate N-domain based on three criteria: the distance between the C-terminal residues of the N-domains and the first determined residue of D1, the surface area buried by each N-domain-D1D2 contact, and the location of contact interface.
There are several disordered regions in the ClpA structure; all of them are loops connecting secondary structure elements or between domains (Fig. 1b).
Other regions for which density was not well defined included residues 252–255, residues 295–300, and notably residues 611–625 (Fig. 1b).
The “ClpP loop,” containing the sequence IGL, which has been implicated in activation of ClpP activity by ClpA (25, 26), was not visible in the crystal. However, residues 611 and 624, which flank the loop, are located on the distal surface of D2 at about 30–35 Å from the center (Fig. 5, b and d).
Residues 611-623 are not visible in the electron density map.
ClpA consists of three functional domains: an N-terminal domain and two ATPase domains, D1 and D2. The N-domain is attached to D1 by a mobile linker and is made up of two tightly bound, identically folded a-helical bundles related by a pseudo 2-fold symmetry.
Residues 142-168 are not visible in the electron density map.
There are several disordered regions in the ClpA structure; all of them are loops connecting secondary structure elements or between domains (Fig. 1b).
The full length ClpA subunit consists of five tandemly linked structural domains (Fig. 1a) corresponding to three functional groups: an N-domain and two AAA ATPase modules. The N-domain has 142 residues; the first AAA ATPase module (D1) has 270 residues and the second ATPase module (D2) contains 319 residues, each consisting of a large and a small sub-domain (Fig. 1b).
The electron density for the 25 residues connecting the N-domain and D1 was not visible, but we were able to identify the cognate N-domain based on three criteria: the distance between the C-terminal residues of the N-domains and the first determined residue of D1, the surface area buried by each N-domain-D1D2 contact, and the location of contact interface.
In the structure, no additional unfilled density is observed next to eS28 and eIF3d (Supplementary Figure S7B), indicating that the eIF4B BD is rather flexible.

Scarcity of NOEs observed for residues C-terminal to Gly430, poor chemical shift dispersion on the 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum, and fast hydrogen-deuterium exchange of the main chain amide protons collectively suggested that residues 430–471 were not involved in a stable fold
Nineteen residues, including Cys19 through Leu37, define the structured core of the BR3 ECD, while the rest of the N- and C-terminal residues are highly flexible (Figure 1)

The final model included residues 37 to 238, that is, the N-terminal amphipathic helix was disordered in both subunits
The question arose whether the presence of the C-terminal α-tubulin tail that interacts with the positively charged groove of V2c might interfere in vitro with the effect of the 4A mutations at the high V2:tubulin ratios used in our experiments. To test this possibility, we performed limited proteolysis experiments with subtilisin that removes the disordered C-terminal tails of both α- and β-tubulin39. As shown in Fig. 5h, cleavage of the tubulin tails significantly reduced the binding of V2 4A–SVBP to microtubules, compared to wild-type and V2 C158A–SVBP, which bound intact and cleaved microtubules similarly.

 Superimposition of the structures of V2c–SVBP (colored as in Fig. 1a) and V2–SVBP (colored in wheat) in cartoon representation. The rmsd of the two superimposed structures is 0.29 Å. The comparison reveals that the structures of V2c and full-length V2 are almost the same, and that the N- and C-terminal flanking regions of V2 are disordered.

Movement of the  lower domain  relative to the  upper domain of the central  segment of the heavy chain in the MgADPAIF4S1Dc complex is coupled to a structural change in the COOH-terminal domains.
The structures of the beryllium and aluminum fluoride complexes suggest that movements in the myosin heavy chain associated with the lower domain of the central 50 kDa segment coupled to movements  in  the  COOH-terminal  segment are the primary source of this conformational change.

The C-terminal peptide of TIMP-2 is proposed to exist as an exposed "tail" responsible for binding to progelatinase A and for increasing the rate of inhibition of active gelatinase A through electrostatic interactions with the C-terminal domain of the enzyme. The C-terminal domains of both TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 participate in low-affinity interactions with the C-terminal domain of gelatinase A which increase the rate of association by a factor of about 100 in both cases.
The work concentrates on a kinetic analysis of factors affecting the rate of association of the inhibitors with gelatinase A and demonstrates that the C-terminal domains of both proteins play an important role in controlling the rate of reaction with active enzyme. C-Terminal domain interactions are also responsible for the binding of TIMP-2 to progelatinase A.
The C-terminal nine amino acid peptide of TIMP-2 appears to make an important contribution to the rate of reaction because when this is removed the rate constant decreases approximately 4-fold to resemble that of TIMP-1. The marked decrease in the rate of inhibition by TIMP-2 with increasing ionic strength confirms the importance of ionic interactions to its mechanism. The effect is considerably decreased with the forms of TIMP-2 that lack the C-terminal peptide and is insignificant in the case of TIMP-1. Thus, the C-terminus of TIMP-2 is primarily, although not completely, responsible for the ionic interactions with gelatinase A.

The COOH-terminal hemopexin-like domain of MMPs is linked to the catalytic domain by a hinge peptide, and it may determine the substrate specificity of MMPs.
In the structure described here, the first 12 residues of the prodomain (Phe1-Val12) are not visible in the electron density and are probably flexible.
Except for the prodomain residues 27–38 and 80–87 the main chains can be traced in continuous electron density.
Twelve residues (Asn27-Ser38) of loop 1 are not visible in the electron density, suggesting that this region is flexible in solution. The flexible part of loop 1 contains the EKRRN sequence of the “bait” region. This EKRRN peptide would be positioned distal to the catalytic domain and is expected to be fully exposed to the solvent, which would provide maximum accessibility for activating proteases such as plasmin, plasma kallikrein, and trypsin (29).
The residues of loop 1 that contain the proteinase susceptible “bait” region are missing and therefore presumed flexible.
The IDR described here and not visible in DPB:1SU3 corresponds to residues 46-57 of the corresponding UniProt sequence.
Since the Thr64-Leu65 bond is unlikely to be cleaved by these serine proteinases, we postulated that these enzymes initially cleave peptide bonds closer to the NH2 terminus in the propeptide to produce initial intermediates which, in turn, cleave the Thr64-Leu65 bond. To confirm this, procollagenase was incubated with plasma kallikrein (2 ug/mL) or plasmin (10 ug/mL) at 0C for 16 h to minimize the proteolytic action of collagenase intermediates. SDS/PAGE analyses of these products showed intermediates with Mr = 46000 (Figure 8). Sequence analysis of the intermediate generated by plasma kallikrein demonstrated that the Arg35-Arg36 and Arg36-Asn37 bonds were initially attacked by this enzyme. The results agree with the specificity of plasma kallikrein. It is therefore concluded that the formation of the 43 000-Mr species by serine proteinases is a two-step process (Figure 9B).
Asn37 corresponds to Asn56 of the EKRRN sequence in UniProt numbering
Among these, a very flexible surface loop comprising residues Gly72 to Gly87 is not visible in the electron density of ligand-free LH3 structures. This loop contains several residues highly conserved among LH isoforms (Supplementary Fig. 9), which are not found in other glycosyltransferases.
Residues 590–610 constitute a flexible loop capping the LH catalytic site.
Structurally related glycosyltransferases also often bear tyrosine residues stacking with the UDP moiety, but these residues are located far in sequence from the canonical DxD motif40,41 responsible for metal ion coordination. Site-directed mutagenesis on Trp75 or Tyr114 into alanine residues yielded folded, but almost completely inactive LH3 variants (Fig. 2c, Supplementary fig. 11). Binding data using SPR on synthetic collagen peptides showed very limited differences between wild-type and mutant LH3 (Supplementary Fig. 11D). Together, these results highlight the distinguishing roles of Trp75 and Tyr114 in donor substrate binding and stabilization.
Trp75 stabilizes the UDP binding
Nonetheless, binding of these donor substrates induced dramatic conformational changes in the enzyme’s catalytic site, with full stabilization of the flexible Gly72-Gly87 loop in a “closed” conformation (Fig. 2b). The UDP pyrophosphate group is stabilized by interactions with Mn2+ and hydrogen bonding with Lys259 and backbone nitrogen of Gly256; both residues are positioned in a uniquely shaped α-helix located at the C-terminus of the domain.
Flexible loop 72–87 becomes well defined only in donor substrate-bound structures
The uracil moiety is sandwiched through π-π stacking interactions between Trp75 and Tyr114, and is stabilized by hydrogen bonding with Thr46 (Fig. 2a, b, Supplementary Fig. 10). Of note, these two residues highlight an unprecedented arrangement of UDP binding residues in glycosyltransferases: Trp75 belongs to the distinctive LH3 flexible loop covering residues Gly72-Gly87, that becomes fully stabilized upon substrate binding (Fig. 2b); Tyr114 is part of a non-canonical DxxD motif (Supplementary fig. 9), where Asp112, and Asp115 are responsible for Mn2+ coordination.

Nearly all residues surrounding the UDP moiety and shaping the LH3 glycosyltransferase catalytic site are conserved, including those involved in the unprecedented mode of UDP-substrate stabilization characterized by dual π-π stacking with Trp75 and Tyr114.

Analysis of electron density maps allowed the identification of a second Fe2+ in the LH domain, coordinated by residues His595, Asp597, Asp611 and His613 (Fig. 3b). Metal ion coordination stabilizes the flexible capping loop 590–610 into a conformation that completely plugs the LH catalytic site, in proximity to the dimer interface (Supplementary Fig. 16A). We could observe a very similar arrangement, although slightly more flexible, by replacing Fe2+ with Mn2+ in crystallization experiments (Supplementary Fig. 16B).
Co-crystallizations with Fe2+ allow identification of a second metal ion bound near the LH catalytic site that stabilizes the flexible capping loop 590–610 (shown in pink)
Four residues coordinate the binding of the second Fe2+ in metal ion-inhibited structures: His595, Asp597, Asp611 and His613. Two of them, His595 and His597, are localized in the flexible capping loop of the protein. This annotation describes His595.

Analysis of electron density maps allowed the identification of a second Fe2+ in the LH domain, coordinated by residues His595, Asp597, Asp611 and His613 (Fig. 3b). Metal ion coordination stabilizes the flexible capping loop 590–610 into a conformation that completely plugs the LH catalytic site, in proximity to the dimer interface (Supplementary Fig. 16A).

The crystals of the full-length enzyme contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit and in both molecules the N-terminal domain is disordered.
Density for the N-terminal 35 amino acids of RluE was not visible in electron density maps calculated for either truncated or full-length RluE. A large single crystal of fulllength RluE was carefully washed in protein-free mother liquor, dissolved in water and run on an SDS-PAGE gel in order to find out if full-length RluE had undergone proteolysis during crystallization. The gel showed a single protein band with the molecular mass of full-length RluE. Therefore, the N-terminal 35 residues of RluE must be disordered in the crystal.
The disordered N-terminal residues may comprise a separate protein domain that vibrates as a rigid body. Other Ψ synthases in the RsuA family contain an S4-like domain at their N-termini that is postulated to bind nonspecifically to RNA substrate29; 30.
The RNA-binding domains of Ψ synthases are usually attached to the rest of the protein by a flexible tether, and so are frequently disordered in crystal structures of the apo enzymes. The N-terminal 35 residues of E. coli RluE contain six arginines and three lysines. The basic nature of the N-terminal region is consistent with its putative role in RNA binding.
For the truncated protein structure, rounds of rebuilding and addition of solvent molecules using Quanta (Accelrys, San Diego, CA), alternated with restrained refinement of atomic positions and isotropic temperature factors in CNS42 were carried out until the R-factor reached 20.1% (Rfree=21.3%). There was no electron density for residues before Asn-36 or for residue Glu-159 in loop L7–8 (Fig. 1); these residues are either not present in the truncated protein or are disordered in the crystals. An analysis of the geometry45 shows that all refinement statistics are well within the expected values at this resolution (Table 2).
Full-length RluE was refined in a similar manner, except that anisotropic B-factors were not refined, and only CNS and REFMAC5 were used for refinement. The two protein molecules in the asymmetric unit had slightly different conformations, so non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were not used. No density for residues 1–37 in one molecule or 1–38 in the other was present in electron density maps, and Glu-159 was also disordered in both molecules.
22 N-terminal amino acids and the histidine tag were not visible in the final electron density maps
The structure defined in this paper comprises residues 26-418
The IDR characterized in the publication and spanning the N-terminal residues of the crystal structure corresponds to region 26-47 of the amino acid sequence, since the natural precursor form of the protein contains a signal peptide (1-24) that is cleaved in the mature secreted protein.

The final model, comprising residues 2 to 86, 101 to 261 and 268 to 286, was refined to an Rfree of 0.219 and RWork of 0.210 at 1.7 Å resolution.
From the description of the final model, it can be inferred that there is a disorder region from positions 87 to 100, however the region of missing residues in the pdb is from 86 to 102.
That perturbation could occur in the complexed trypsin was predicted from previous studies, showing a loss of stability and an increase in proteolytic vulnerability of proteases in complexes with serpins. But the surprise is the extent of the disruption observed here, such that although clear and continuous density was seen for more than 60% of the structure of trypsin, some 37% was crystallographically disordered (missing residues 16-41, 62-84, 110-120, 139-156, 186-190, 223-224).

The disordered region was not stated in the paper, but observed in the PDB structure (2MM9). It spans from the end of the sheet beta-3' to the beginning of helix alpha-4.
All secondary structures are connected by short loops (1–4
residues) except the one situated between beta-1 and beta-2. This
beta1-beta2 loop that we refer to as [H/C] loop contains the histidine
and cysteine residues from BolA_H and BolA_C groups,
respectively. In accordance with the existence of two groups,
the [H/C] loop can be formed by 11+/-6 (up to 20) residues in
BolA_H members
Start and end position of the H/C were taken from PDB 4PUG.
A remarkable feature of the structure of APUM2385-655 is the unique characteristics of R3.
This PUF repeat contains 74 amino acid residues (residues
213–286) and includes an insertion (residues 235–270; the
electron density of residues 258–270 was missing) located
between the second and third helix. The insertion comprises
a disordered region and two short -helices (i1 and i2),
located at the inner concave surface, that participate in the
recognition of RNA bases

Secondary structure elements are indicated. Residues involved in interactions with DNA bases and backbone are labelled with red and blue circles, respectively. Dashed bars indicate isordered regions in the crystal, blue rectangles indicate the residues involved in dimerization. Green triangles indicate the position of Arabidopsis mutations and residues divergent in PpLFY1 are highlighted in pink. (B) Two DNA duplexes containing the LEAFY-binding sites from AP1 and AG promoters present in the LEAFY–DNA complex crystals are depicted. Base pairs related by a dyad (indicated by a black dot) are highlighted in yellow.
Figure 2 shows an alignment of LFY homologos. Positions 400 to 424 of LFY_ARATH are indicated as disoreded in the crystal, but positions numbers in the paper and the PDB do not correspond with Uniprot sequence. The corrected position numbers of the disordered region are 396 to 420.
The β7–β8 loop itself is disordered in all available OTU structures but, like the disordered loops in the unliganded S1 ubiquitin-binding site, it may undergo conformational changes upon binding a cognate partner that are hindered by the I325N substitution.

In A20, two loops (residues 152-160 and 212-228) in this distal binding site are disordered despite high sequence conservation, and hence surface analysis in this region is not meaningful.

No large conformational changes occur upon Ub binding. However, two unstructured loops in A20 apo are stabilised by Ub, forming helix α6’ and the β2’-β2” sheet (compare Extended Data Fig. 2j).
The residues 539–644 were not observed in the cryo-EM map, suggesting high flexibility of this region.
The region of residues visible in the GAT–Rabaptin5 complex crystal is represented with capital letters, and mobile residues are in lowercase letters.
The five N-terminal and 10 C-terminal residues and segments 32–39 and 61–68 were disordered in the crystal.
C-BP-2 has a longer disordered loop I, and an extended C-terminal tail, which is unstructured and very mobile.
The last 14 residues, 276–289, are unstructured.
Another noticeable feature of the C-BP-2 sequence relative to other IGFBP C- domains is its 11–13 residue extended C-terminal tail (Figure 2(e)). The solution structure of C-BP-2 shows clearly that this extended C-terminal tail is unstructured (Figure 1(a)).
Residues in the C-terminal tail beyond Gln277 exhibit J(0.87ωH) >15 ps rad- 1 and thus have even greater flexibility.
A possible explanation for the anomalously higher R2 values and the failure in fitting the relaxation parameters is that the motions of the core of C-BP-2 cannot be described by a simple anisotropic tumbling model with a unique diffusion tensor. This is probably a consequence of the presence of a longer and very flexible C-terminal tail, together with a longer disordered loop compared to C-BP-6.
The IDR characterized in the publication and spanning residues 276-289 corresponds to region 312-325 of the amino acid sequence, since the natural precursor form of the protein contains a signal peptide (1-35).
In the zymogen, one monomer has missing density for a flexible loop between residues 461 and 479, and the second monomer has missing density for residues 460–472. In the active enzyme, residues 460–480 are missing in both monomers.
Residues 462–471 form a flexible solvent-exposed loop that links the last α-helical segment of the catalytic core domain to the first β-strand of the barrel 1 domain.
Residues 462-471 represent the minimal region where densities are missing in all monomers of  all X-ray structures of the protein. There is one residue shift between the paper and UniProt, due to cleavage of the initiator methionine.
Residues 462 to 471 form a highly flexible solventexposed loop that links the last alpha-helical segment of the catalytic core domain to the first beta-strand of the barrel 1 domain.
Both monomers have missing density for a flexible loop between residues 461–479.
Both monomers have missing density for a flexible loop between residues 462 and 478
Residues 462-471 represent the minimal region where densities are missing in all monomers of  all X-ray structures of the protein. Due to removal of the initiator methionine, there is one resiue shift between UniProt and the paper, Ser469 corresponds to UniProt residue 470.
Residues 462-471 form a flexible solvent-exposed loop that link the last α-helical segment of the catalytic core domain to the first β-strand of the barrel 1 domain. This hinge region harbors Ser469, the cleavage site for proteolytic activation of the zymogen. This residue is flanked by polar residues, predicted to lie near the surface of the protein, which may be involved in recognition by an activating protease.
Due to removal of the initiator methionine, there is one resiue shift between UniProt and the paper, Ser469 corresponds to UniProt residue 470.
Proteolysis of the TGase 3 zymogen with dispase cleaves at Ser469 the flexible
hinge of sequences that joins the active site domain to beta-barrel 1 domains.
Due to removal of the initiator methionine, there is one resiue shift between UniProt and the paper, Ser469 corresponds to UniProt residue 470.
The construct-derived His6 tag and residues 35–44, 631–638, and 653–672 of HC1, which were clearly present in the protein preparation as determined by MS, were not visible in the electron density and are therefore assumed to be unstructured or highly conformationally labile.

In addition, the IRI heavy chains carried several O-linked glycans located on Thr619 of heavy chain 1 and a cluster of four O-linked oligosaccharides on Thr612, Ser619, Thr621, and Thr637 of heavy chain 2.
Edman degradation of the C-terminal HC1 peptide, Thr608-Arg627, identified Thr619 as the site of O-glycosylation.
Thus the carbohydrate attached to HC1 Thr619 is a trisaccharide composed of (Thr)-GalNAc-Gal-SA (Figure 2B).
In addition to the N-glycans, the IRI heavy chains also carry 5 O-linked trisaccharides: one attached to HC1 Thr619 and a cluster of four near the C-terminus of HC2 (Figure 3).
Thr619 corresponds to Thr653, since the natural precursor form of the protein contains a signal peptide (1-27) and a propeptide (28-34).
As already pointed out by Enghild et al. [l], the C-terminal Asp residue, characterized by amino acid analysis of these peptides, was only identified with a low yield by Edman degradation. This is consistent with the fact that this residue is glycosylated.
Effectively fragment ions at mlz 679 for fraction 1 and mlz 652 for fraction 3 indicated that N-acetyl hexosamine is linked to the C-terminal Asp of each heavy chain.
A fragment ion at mlz 491 for fraction 3 (Fig. 6B) demonstrated that the linkage involves the C6 of the terminus (reducing) N-acetylhexosamine and the C-terminal Asp of H1.
The linkage to the H1 subunit involves an ester linkage between C6 of an internal N-acetylhexosamine and the C-terminal Asp638.
On the IT1 fragment obtained, two different tetrapeptides covalently linked to the chondroitin sulphate chain should be present: Val-Asp-ThrAsp proceeding from H1 and Val-Glu-Asn-Asp corresponding to the C-terminal sequence of H2.
Asp638 corresponds to Asp672, which is the C-terminal residue of the mature form of the protein, since the natural precursor form contains a signal peptide (1-27) and two propeptides (28-34 and 673-911).

Of the 133 residues in the designed construct, 117 residues were modeled in each of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. In both molecules, residues 208–220 and 339–341 of VRN1(208–341) were not modeled due to poor electron density at the N and C termini, indicating disorder.
In our JMJ14CD structure, the region corresponding to human KDM5
ARID-PHD cassette (residues 125–168) has no annotated domain
and is disordered in the structure.
PDB structures of both, free and ligand bound, forms have a range of missing residues from positions 196 to 212.
The 1H–15N HSQC confirmed that most of the DRB4C is disordered in solution as we observed narrow spectral dispersion in the proton dimension (Supplementary Figure S1E). The random
coil nature of DRB4C was also evident from the chemical
shifts of C-alpha and C-beta. Moreover, the majority of DRB4C resonances assume a negative value in 15N–{1H} hetronuclear NOE corroborating its unstructured nature (Figure 1B). Interestingly, resonances belonging to residues 294–355 (i.e.
DRB4Cc) were absent in the 1H–15N HSQC of DRB4C.
Protein disorder algorithms predicted that DRB4Cc may assume an ordered conformation. Subsequently, a welldispersed 1H–15N HSQC for DRB4Cc implied the presence of a tertiary structure.

In contrast to the α-tentacle, neither Cap32/34 nor CapZ crystals grown at physiological pH provided an interpretable electron density for the C-terminal segment of the β-subunit (β-tentacle), indicating that this part of the CP molecule is highly mobile.
Although the β-tentacle sequence is not conserved in general, the three hydrophobic positions (residues L258, L262, and L266 in GgCapZ) at intervals of four residues are conserved (Figure  5) and exchanging them by polar residues abolishes actin-binding

The electron density ends at approximately residue 110, leaving 23 residues unaccounted for in the electron density. Mass spectrometry of the crystals reveals completely intact protein of ~133 amino acids, suggesting that the unobserved residues are present in the crystal lattice but not visible in the electron density.
The C-terminal 23 residues were never visible in electron density maps despite map improvement and refinement, and are presumably disordered, which may contribute to the observed R-factors.

the 2 Pa_LOX structures available differ mainly in the N-terminal region, with models starting at residues Ile50 (Fig. 1A) and Ala19 (Fig. 1B).
The longer N-terminal tail of the structure starting at Ala19 protrudes toward a neighboring molecule, where it is stabilized by a large number of interactions, in particular with the polar head of the phospholipid
The first 38 residues of ZPI, which include many acidic amino acids, are disordered and were not built in the structure
According to PDB available sequence, the 38 firsts residues correspond to the annotated region (22-59) as the protein structure is built from A60, considered in the structure as residue 39. Residues 1-21 correspond to the signal peptide
For the ZPI moiety, the whole of the backbone is visible (Fig.1A), with the exception of the first 39 residues, all of which are part of the N-terminal tail, which is an extension that is not present in other serpins. 
According to PDB available sequence, the 39 firsts residues correspond to the annotated region (22-60). Residues 1-21 correspond to the signal peptide
All atoms of the inhibitors and of FXa lie in well-defined electron density except the EGF1 domain which was not visible
EGF1 domain is comprised on residues 90-120
The EGF1 domain, disordered in the tetragonal, arginine-bound crystal form, was suggested to become ordered in the presence of calcium (24). However, the orthorhombic crystals of fXazDX-9065a grown at 10 mM calcium also show apparent disorder of the EGF1 domain. Furthermore, the crystal packing of the two crystal forms is not compatible with a unique EGF1 orientation (relative to EGF2)
EGF1 domain is comprised on residues 90-120
The electron density for the factor Xa/ZK-807834 complex indicates that the first residue in the light chain is Lys-L87 and no electron density was observed for the EGF1 domain. 
EGF1 domain is comprised on residues 90-120
Lys-L87 corresponds to Lys 127 in protein original sequence
However, the protein used by Kamata et al. (9) included the first EGF domain of factor Xa, which was apparently missing from our own construct
The EGF-1 domain is not visible in the electron density maps probably because of disorder, and the rather high free R factors might relate to this disordered EGF-1 domain.

All atoms of the inhibitors and of fXa lie in well-defined electron density except the EGF1 domain that was not visible.

X-ray structure analysis confirmed the biochemical characterisation and also revealed that the N-terminal epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain is flexibly disordered in crystals
We report here the molecular consituents of these chemically characterized FXa crystals and the refined strcuture of the truncated FXa molecule (Fig. 1), which consists of the second EGF module, the catalytic domain of activated factor X and a flexibly disordered N-terminal EGF. 
EGF1 domain is comprised on residues 90-120
This led us to conclude that the first EGF domain might be flexibly disordered so that subsequent refinement was based upon this premise
However, there was no indication of a Gla domain and the N-terminal EGF module still remained disordered
The final electron and difference density maps showed no evidence of a Gla domain or the N-terminal EGF module
Due to the disorder of the first EGF module, however, the FXa structure described here begins with Cys389 (Fig. 1)
In contrast to the foregoing, the final electron density did not show any region assignable to the N-terminal EGF domain of FXa. Since biochemical analysis indicated presence of the module, it must be concluded that it is flexibly disordered in the crystal about its heptapeptide interdomain bridge (Fig. 1).
The EGF-1 domain is not visible in the electron density maps probably because of disorder, and the rather high free R factors might relate to this disordered EGF-1 domain.

 Surprisingly, the N-terminal EGF domain (EGF1) was found to be disordered. Numerous sparse density peaks in this region were observed in electron density maps, but efforts to trace a backbone through these
peaks did not improve refinement statistics or result in improved density. The EGF1 domain was therefore omitted from the model
EGF1 domain is comprised on residues 90-120
The EGF1 domain (transparent white) was disordered and modeled using the EGF1 domain from PDB 1XKA.
The entire N-terminal EGF1 domain, and its leading pentapeptide, which is flexibly disordered in other des-fXastructures was not located in the electron density maps.

The majority of the rest of the protein is in well-determined electron density, except for the EGF1 domain, which was not visible.

In addition, the whole N-terminal EGF1 module, and its leading pentapeptide, is flexibly disordered as in other des-fXa structures

There is no electron density observed for the first EGF domain, thus models for the EGF1 domain were not included in subsequent refinement steps.

AspH-TPR-Ox was successfully co-crystallized with a 39- residue fragment of hFX EGF1 (AspH-TPR-Ox:hFX, Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 9). The AspH-TPR-Ox structure reveals electron density at the active site corresponding to 18 of the 39 hFX EGF1 substrate residues (aa 99–116: -GKC3KDGLGEYTC4TC5LEGF-) and for a disulfide linkage between Cys101hFX and Cys110hFX (Fig. 3e). Highly specific interactions, including multiple protein–protein/peptide interactions with both AspH-Ox and TPR domains are apparent (Fig. 3b–d). The N-terminal region of hFX (aa 100–105) interacts with the AspH-Ox domain and the C-terminal region of hFX (aa 106–116) interacts with the TPR domain

No electron density was observed for the residues comprising the predicted nuclear localization signal (residues 360–374) and BTB5–6 (residues 270–295), and they were not built in the model;
No electron density was observed for residues 169–176 and 357–374 of SPOP169–374 Y353E, and residues comprising the 3–4loop were associated with higher crystallographic B factors, as reported previously (Zhuanget  al., 2009; Erringtonet  al.,2012).
Human SPOP is a 374-residue protein that contains an N-terminal MATH domain (residues 28–166) that recruits substrates and a central BTB domain (residues 177–296) that mediates dimerization and interactions with Cul3 (Fig. 1a).
No electron density was observed for residues 169–176 and 357–374 of SPOP169–374 Y353E, and residues comprising the 3–4loop were associated with higher crystallographic B factors, as reported previously (Zhuanget  al., 2009; Erringtonet  al.,2012).
Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in SW1990 cells showed that SPOP interacted with the stem-cell marker NANOG, and this interaction has recently been shown to play a critical role in regulating progression of prostate cancer. We showed that, in one patient with pancreatic cancer, the expression of a truncated form of SPOP (p.Q360*) lacking the nuclear localization signal led to nuclear accumulation of NANOG, which promoted growth and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells. Our results suggest that SPOP suppresses progression of pancreatic cancer by promoting the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of NANOG. These results identify the SPOP-NANOG interaction as a potential therapeutic target against pancreatic cancer.
Since the Q360* mutation is located in the linker between the BTB domain and the nuclear localization sequence, we speculated that the mutated SPOP sequence containing the C1078T mutation encodes a truncated protein without the nuclear localization sequence (Supplementary Fig. 1a-c). Indeed, fluorescence microscopy and nuclear/cytoplasmic separation showed that SPOP-WT mainly located in cell nucleus, SPOP-Q360* mainly located in cell cytoplasm, NANOG localized predominantly in the nucleus (Fig. 7b, c).
The inability of SPOP-Q360* to accumulate in the nucleus was associated with an inability to bind importin subunit alpha-6 and 7 (IPOA6 and IPOA7), a shuttle carrier between nucleus and cytoplasm (Supplementary Fig. 2).
The patient-derived Q360* mutation disrupts nuclear localization of SPOP and impairs the SPOP-mediated poly-ubiquitination and degradation of NANOG.
These results suggest that the Q360* mutation alters SPOP localization and allows hyperaccumulation of NANOG in the nucleus, where it can promote cell proliferation.

SPOP-Q360* repressed levels of NANOG and other downstream proteins to a much weaker extent than SPOP-WT (Fig. 7d), and these results were associated with impaired interaction between SPOP and NANOG, as well as impaired ubiquitination of NANOG (Fig. 7e, f).

To examine how the patient-derived Q360* mutation may disrupt the tumor-suppressive role of SPOP in pancreatic cancer, we transiently upregulated expression of SPOP-WT or SPOP-Q360* in cells overexpressing NANOG. We found that the Q360* mutation weakened the antiproliferative effect of SPOP under these conditions (Fig. 7a).
There was no electron density for residues 1 to 24 or 135 to 145. The C-terminal residues are probably disordered.
Region 135-147 is not visible in the structure, which corresponds to region 340-352 of the amino acid sequence. Protein AMBP is proteolitically cleaved into separately functioning proteins. This region is part of protein bikunin.
There was no electron density for residues 1 to 24 or 135 to 145.
Bikunin has two glycosylation sites, residues Ser10 and Asn45. Ser10 is the more heavily glycosylated (Hochstrasser et al., 1981) but it is in a section of peptide that is not visible in our maps.
The IDR characterized in the publication and spanning residues 1-24 corresponds to region 206-229 of the amino acid sequence. Protein AMBP is proteolitically cleaved into separately functioning proteins. This region is part of protein bikunin.
The first seven N-terminal residues, Gly1–Pro7, and the C-terminal residues Gly172–Lys193, as well as the Strep-tag II were not visible in the electron density map and hence were omitted from the final model.
Region 172-183 of the protein is not visible in the structure, which corresponds to region 191-202 of the associated UniProt sequence. Protein AMBP is proteolitically cleaved into separately functioning proteins. This region is part of protein α1-microglobulin.
The chondroitin sulphate chain is bound at its reducing end by the typical linkage structure Gal-Gal-Xyl to the Ser10 of bikunin whereas the C-terminal Asp of the heavy chain H3 esterifies C6 of an internal N-acetylgalactosamine inside the GAG chain.
Fractions 4 and 5 correspond to the peptides Va12-Gln14 and Alal-Gln14 of bikunin, respectively (Table 2). As expected [l, 141], Ser10 was recovered with a low yield during Edman degradation: it constitutes the attachment point of the chondroitin sulphate chain as shown by the monosaccharide analysis of fraction 4 (Xyl/Gal = 1:2.1).
A molecular ion at mlz 1900 was identified in fraction 4 (data not shown). The expected mlz for the bikunin-derived peptide is 1286. The difference (614Da) was explained by the presence of the tetrasaccharide Xyl-Gal-Gal-dehydrohexuronic acid, typical of a chondroitin AC lyase digest of Ser-linked GAG [16].
Ser10 corresponds to Ser215, since protein AMBP is proteolitically cleaved into separately functioning proteins and this region is part of protein bikunin (206-352).
Residues 1-2, 201-204 and 628-657 plus the His-tag are disordered in both subunits of the homodimer.
Residues 628-657 correspond to residues 649 and 677 of the original protein sequence as the first 21 residues are omitted (signal peptide)
Proteolytic digestion indicated that PTEN has unstructured or loosely folded regions of 7 and 49 residues at the N and C termini, respectively, and of 24 residues in an internal loop (residues 286–309; Figure 1B; data not shown).
Secondary structure prediction and the results of proteolytic digestion experiments suggest that the tail is a relatively unstructured and presumably flexible region.
Here, we show that the PTEN tail is necessary for maintaining protein stability and that it also acts to inhibit PTEN function. Thus, removing the tail results in a loss of stability but does not result in a loss of function because the resultant protein is more active. Furthermore, tail-dependent regulation of stability and activity is linked to the phosphorylation of three residues (S380, T382, and T383) within the tail. Therefore, the tail is likely to mediate the regulation of PTEN function through phosphorylation.
The PTEN tail modulates PTEN stability.
In keeping with these results, it was recently reported that the steady-state level of PTEN;1-351 is reduced compared to that of PTEN;WT when the protein is produced by transfection in COS-7 cells (14). Together these data suggest that the PTEN tail, while not required for the functional activity of the protein, is required for maintaining stability.
The tail domain modulates PTEN biological activity.
Surprisingly, at equivalent input plasmid concentrations PTEN;1-353 reproducibly induced a greater increase in G1 than PTEN;WT (data not shown). Next, the activities of PTEN;WT and PTEN;1-353 were compared when the proteins were produced at similar steady-state levels. Plasmid titration indicated that equivalent protein levels were obtained at 2 μg of PTEN;1-353 and 0.5 μg of PTEN;WT (Fig. ​(Fig.2A2A and B). At these levels PTEN;1-353 induced a significantly more robust G1 arrest (Fig. ​(Fig.2C).2C).
We next compared PTEN;WT and PTEN;1-353 in a FKHR transcriptional activation assay.
We next compared PTEN;WT and PTEN;1-353 in a FKHR transcriptional activation assay. Consistent with the results obtained in the cell cycle assay (Fig. ​(Fig.2C),2C), the ability of PTEN;1-353 to induce FKHR transcriptional activity was enhanced compared to that of PTEN;WT. Furthermore, at every DNA plasmid concentration tested, PTEN;1-353 induced FKHR activation more efficiently than PTEN;WT, although protein levels were reduced by more than fourfold. These results suggest that the PTEN tail not only plays a role in maintaining its protein stability but also in regulating its biological activity. Specifically, these data suggest that the tail acts to restrict or inhibit PTEN function.
Furthermore, tail-dependent regulation of stability and activity is linked to the phosphorylation of three residues (S380, T382, and T383) within the tail. Therefore, the tail is likely to mediate the regulation of PTEN function through phosphorylation.
PTEN is phosphorylated within the tail domain.
Next, every serine and threonine in the tail was mutated either singly or in clusters to alanine. These PTEN mutants were transfected into U2-OS cells and labeled with orthophosphate. No single-amino-acid substitution abrogated or significantly reduced the total phosphorylation of PTEN (data not shown). However, the substitution of a serine/threonine cluster, S380, T382, T383, and S385 (the A4 mutant), did significantly alter total PTEN phosphorylation.
These results indicate that most, if not all, of the PTEN tail phosphorylation occurs on serine 370 and one or more sites of the A4 cluster (S380, T382, T383, and S385).
Mutation of the phosphorylation sites in the tail alter PTEN stability and biological activity.
Taken together, these data show that the increased activity associated with deletion of the tail is entirely mimicked by mutations within the A4 cluster, specifically S380, T382, or T383.
The above data raised the possibility that phosphorylation of these three specific residues (S380, T382, and T383) might be required to maintain PTEN in a stable yet relatively inactive state.
In keeping with the data for PTEN;A4 and for the individual phosphorylation site mutants (with mutations S380A, T382A, and T383A), PTEN;A3 was found to have a reduced protein half-life, to be expressed at lower steady-state levels, and to be more active than wild-type PTEN in biological assays (Fig. ​(Fig.6C to F).
This region is associated to S380.

Phosphorylation of six residues in the C-terminal tail of PTEN results in auto-inhibitory interactions with the phosphatase and C2 domains, effectively blocking both the active site and the membrane-binding interface of PTEN.
Phosphorylation of the C-terminal tail differentially inhibits PTEN towards distinct substrates
To compare the activities and specificities of differentially phosphorylated PTEN constructs, phosphatase assays were conducted against four substrates: a phosphotyrosine-containing acidic polypeptide, the soluble lipid diC8-PIP3, inositol tetrakis phosphate (IP4) and liposome-incorporated PIP3 (Figures 1B–1E).
We found that phosphorylation of PTEN caused a dramatic reduction in activity against all substrates. Intriguingly, when PTEN was phosphorylated on only four sites (pSer380/pThr382/pThr383/pSer385) by using the phosphorylated PTEN-2A mutant (Phos-PTEN-2A), activity against the phosphopeptide and soluble diC8-PIP3/IP4 substrates was restored (Figures 1B–1D), but PTEN remained inhibited against liposome-incorporated PIP3 substrate (Figure 1E; Supplementary Figure S3). This suggests that pThr366 and pSer370 may have a role in occluding the active site of PTEN, whereas pSer380, pThr382, pThr383 and pSer385 have a role in occluding the membrane-binding surface. Phos-PTEN-4A, phosphorylated on only two sites, pThr366 and pSer370, showed similar activities with all substrates to that of dephosphorylated PTEN-4A, with only a slight reduction in activity against liposome-incorporated PIP3

HDX–MS shows that the phosphorylated C-terminal tail forms intramolecular interactions with both the C2 and the phosphatase domains
Overall, these decreases in HDX suggest that the fully phosphorylated C-terminal tail makes contact at the C2/phosphatase interface and more extensive contacts within the phosphatase domain, interacting extensively with all three loops of the active site and the PBM.

N and C termini of the protein are disordered. This is particularly evident in the case of the N terminus (see Fig. 3) which is very flexible and tends to form a bent structure at the top of the Gly11‐Gly12 residues and the neighboring Pro13.
The relaxation data for 21 residues (first eight residues form N terminus included) were not collected due to signals overlap, intensive exchange with water, or low signal‐to‐noise ratio
There is a signal peptide of 26 residues, so there is a shift between UniProt numbering and the numbering in the article. Gly11 mentioned in the article corresponds to UniProt residue 37.

It is worth mentioning that the N-terminal segment of hCC is cleaved by cysteine proteases. In the case of hCC, cleavage takes place after Gly11 residue.

The Rac1 C-terminal Domain Associates with Effector and Adapter Proteins
Using pull-down experiments followed by lipid kinase activity assays (23), we found that indeed the TAT-Rac1 C terminus (amino acids 178-188) bound PIP5K activity when used as a bait to fish in HL60 cell lysates (Fig. 4).
TAT-Rac1 also bound PIP5K in KG1a, MDCKII, and COS7 cells (data not shown). Apparently, the Rac1 178-188 region, encoded by the peptide used in this study, is already sufficient to mediate association of Rac1 with PIP5K.
We next examined the binding of the Rac1 peptide to other signaling proteins, implicated in cell migration and cell-cell adhesion. We found that the adapter proteins NCK and Crk bound specifically to the Rac1 C-terminal peptide.
Subsequently, using transient transfection of v-Crk mutants that were mutated in the SH2 or the N-terminal SH3 domain (27), we could show that the association of Crk with the Rac1 C terminus is mediated by the N-terminal SH3 domain of Crk and is not dependent on an intact SH2 domain (Fig. 5C).

Apparently, both the effector loop and as the C terminus of Rac1 are required, in a non-redundant fashion, for growth factor-induced membrane ruffling and proper Rac1 localization.
The Rac1 C-terminal Domain Inhibits Actin Polymerization and Cell Migration
Having established at least two signaling proteins that associate directly with the Rac1 C terminus, we tested whether these interactions would involve identical residues within the Rac1 C-terminal sequence. To this end, two mutants of the TAT-Rac1 C-terminal peptide were synthesized. In the first one, the three prolines (amino acids 179-181) were replaced by alanine residues (Rac1 PPP-AAA). In the second, the RKR sequence (amino acids 185-187) was replaced by alanine residues (Rac1 RKR-AAA) (Fig. 6A). The interaction of the Rac1 C terminus with PIP5K was shown previously (28) to be mediated by basic amino acids, in particular Lys-186. In line with these data, the TAT-Rac1 RKR-AAA peptide no longer associated with PIP5K activity in the pull-down assay (Fig. 6B).
These data establish the presence of two binding motifs for signaling proteins within the Rac1 C terminus.

In the second, the RKR sequence (amino acids 185-187) was replaced by alanine residues (Rac1 RKR-AAA) (Fig. 6A).
Because the interaction with the Crk adapter protein involved the Crk SH3 domain, we tested whether the three consecutive prolines in the Rac1 C terminus mediated Crk binding. When using the Rac1 PPP-AAA peptide, the binding to Crk was abolished, confirming that these prolines were required for the interaction (Fig. 6C).
These data establish the presence of two binding motifs for signaling proteins within the Rac1 C terminus.
Next, the wild type and the two mutant peptides were used to determine the relation between the presence of either binding site and localization and effects of the peptides. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate, a product of PIP5K, is present in lipid rafts from where actin polymerization is mediated (29, 30). In line with this, the wild type Rac1 C terminus co-localized with lipid rafts in HL60 cells (Fig. 7A), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of this peptide on in vitro migration is because of interference with localized PIP5K/phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate-dependent, Rac-mediated signaling.
The Rac1 PPP-AAA peptide also localized to lipid rafts; the Rac1 RKR-AAA peptide showed less prominent co-localization with lipid rafts, suggesting that the basic motif in the C terminus is involved, perhaps via PIP5K, in mediating associations with raft-resident proteins.
In MDCKII cells, the Rac1 C terminus showed a clear localization to both cell-cell junctions and peripheral membranes (Fig. 7B). The peptide did not associate to endomembranes or to the nuclear membrane. This localization was mimicked by the Rac1 PPP-AAA peptide, but the Rac1 RKR-AAA peptide showed a marked loss of accumulation at peripheral membranes.
The Rac1 RKR-AAA peptide no longer inhibited HGF-induced membrane ruffling, whereas the Rac1 PPP-AAA peptide did (Fig. 7C). This suggests that the RKR sequence in the Rac1 C terminus controls membrane ruffling and Rac1-localization to these ruffles, possibly through the association with PIP5K.
These data further underscore the relationship between the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal domain of Rho-like GTPases and their intracellular targeting and suggests that binding partners for Rac1 are also differentially distributed over distinct regions of the plasma membrane (i.e. cell-cell junctions versus peripheral plasma membrane).
Finally, the different Rac1 peptides were characterized for their effects on SDF-1-induced actin polymerization and chemotaxis. The Rac1 PPP-AAA peptide efficiently blocked SDF-1-induced actin polymerization, whereas the Rac1 RKR-AAA peptide did not (Fig. 7E). Similarly, the Rac1 RKR-AAA peptide no longer interfered significantly with SDF-1-induced chemotaxis of HL60 cells. In contrast, the PPP-AAA mutant peptide inhibited migration as efficiently as the wild type peptide (Fig. 7F). This indicates that, in addition to the Crk binding proline-rich motif, it is primarily the basic, PIP5K binding motif that contributes to the control of actin polymerization and cell migration by Rac1.
The construct (residues 45–579) can be traced in the electron density map almost in its entirety (Fig. 1), except for two disordered regions connecting the two kringles (residues 144–168) and kringle-2 to the A chain (residues 255–273).
The linker connecting the two kringles is 26 residues long, from Gly-144 to Gln-169, and completely disordered.

After molecular replacement of the Gla-domainless prothrombin structure using the coordinates 3NXP of prethrombin-1, extra electron density was clearly detected to assign fragment 1 with confidence from Gly-68 to Cys-143, covering kringle-1 (Cys-65 to Cys-143) almost entirely.

The significant variation in the distance between residues 101 in kringle-1 and residue 210 in kringle-2 detected by LRET measurements is caused by the intrinsic flexibility of the connecting linker between the two kringles that appears as disordered in the crystal structure.

All domains of ProTΔ146–167 are clearly resolved in the electron density map, except for several residues of Lnk3. The important cleavage site at R271 is contained in this segment and has so far eluded X-ray detection in all published structures of human GD-ProT (15), prethrombin-1 (17) or meizothrombin desF1 (16). Disorder in this region supports the conclusion that R271 is constitutively exposed to solvent for proteolytic attack, regardless of the conformation of Lnk2.

In concert with removal of auto-inhibition, bicelles introduce large peaks shifts (Figure S1A) and NOEs to theGlu74-Asn80 region that imply its change from disorder in the free state to formation of an ordered hairpin (Figure S6).

Also consistent with the hypothesis of distortion, the N-terminal 20 residues appear more disordered with heparin dp8 bound (Figures 6A and 6B)
Heparin dp8 may enhance disorder near the N terminus (Figure 6A) and appears to recruit the basic and dynamic C terminus a significant distance to the binding site on the back of the catalytic domain (Figure 6D), perhaps facilitating maturation (Figure 3)
The protein sequence here described starts on residue 21
The final model of iPGM-m consisted of two subunits with two Mn2 þ and Zn2 þ ions modelled within domain A of each subunit (Supplementary Fig. 9a) and the first 20 residues of the N terminus and last 13 residues of the C terminus were disordered and could not be modelled. The
two subunits are nearly identical with an RMSD deviation of 0.58 Å between Ca atoms for 517 residues aligned using GESAMT62 (Supplementary Fig. 9b). Crystals of the orthorhombic form (C. elegans iPGM-o) were obtained after approximately 6 months and diffracted to higher resolution than iPGM-m. Similarly, the N- and C-terminal residues were disordered in the iPGM-o as well.
From the apo iPGM structure we observed that the N-terminal
18 amino acids, unique to C. elegans iPGM, were disordered.

The reactive center loop (RCL) (extending from G364 to P381) is flexible in the vaspin structure.
In one of the chains (A) of the 4IF8 structure the electron density is only missing for residues 367-377, not for the whole RCL.
X-ray structures of SECs demonstrate that after initial cleavage of the RCL remaining residues beginning at the P15 glycine, following the standard nomenclature [28], are inserted into the β-sheet A as a new β-strand [27, 29].
SEC stands for serpin–enzyme complex (members of the serpin family typically form SDS-stable complexes with target proteases). 
UniProt explanation for this protease cleavage reaction: The reactive center loop (RCL) extends out from the body of the protein and directs binding to the target protease. The protease cleaves the serpin at the reactive site within the RCL, establishing a covalent linkage between the carboxyl group of the serpin reactive site and the serine hydroxyl of the protease. The resulting inactive serpin-protease complex is highly stable.
It has been shown that the serpin inhibitory mechanism is critically dependent on the length of the RCL [31] and is furthermore structurally based on conserved small side-chain amino acids within the hinge region of inhibitory serpins. This also applies to vaspin, as the mutation of alanine 369 to proline (vaspinA369P) within the vaspin hinge region converts vaspin from inhibitor of hK7 to substrate.
The role of the Reactive Center Loop (RCL) in serpins is inhibition of proteases. I added the region 367-377 because that is the disordered fraction of the RCL.
The RCL loop in both monomers was observed to be mobile and relatively disordered and was not modeled fully in either monomer.
Recombinant maspin (18 μm) was treated with 0.25 μm recombinant human cathepsin L (24) at 37 °C for 30 min in 0.1 m NaAc, pH 5.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Brij-35, 10 mm cysteine. Complete cleavage within the RCL was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, and the molecular masses of the cleaved products were found to be 38.24 and 4.707 kDa by mass spectrometry. Based on these data (and the observation that the only cysteine residue in the C-terminal peptide is buried and unmodified in all crystal structures) the position of the cleavage site was mapped to P5/P6 (SIE↓VPG).
The protease cleavage happens between residues 335 and 336 of the reactive center loop (RCL), which was annotated as regulation of limited proteolysis.
The N- and C-terminal residues (1-2 and 50-63) and the Ω-loop comprising residues 24-30
are disordered. 
Comparison of the HRG-R EGF-like domain structure with the previously determined
structure of human EGF [Hommel et al. (1992) J. Mol. Biol. 227, 271-282] reveals a high degree of structural similarity; excluding the N-terminal region (residues 1-13), the disordered Ω-loop region (residues 24-30) that contains a three-residue insertion in HRG-R relative to hEGF, and the disordered C-terminal region (residues 50-63), the CR alignment between the HRG-R and hEGF minimized mean structures has a rms difference of ∼1 Å.
The C-terminal residues, Met51-Tyr63, are clearly disordered (Figures 4 and 5) and flexible (as judged from 15N relaxation measurements; W. J. Fairbrother, unpublished results) in solution.
Excluding the N-terminal region (Ser1-Phe13), the disordered Ω-loop (Lys24-Ser30), and the disordered Cterminal region (Pro50-Tyr63), the CR alignment between the HRG-R EGF-like domain and hEGF minimized mean structures is very good, with an rms difference of 0.98 Å
[this is likely within the accuracy limits of both structures (Zhao & Jardetzky, 1994)].
Pro20 and Tyr63 correspond to Pro226 and Tyr239
The C-terminal flanking region outside the EGF-like domain (Val229-Lys241) is highly disordered and is not shown.
We crystallized a complex of NELL2 EGF1–6 with Robo3 FN1, and Robo3 FN2–3 alone, following proteolysis within the 15-residue-long flexible linker between FN1 and FN2 in crystallization drops (Supplementary Fig. 2a)
Silver staining of the gels revealed that the first crystal form was likely NELL2 EGF1–6 complexed to Robo3 FN1 following proteolysis in the linker joining FN1 and FN2 domains (Supplementary Fig. 2a), and the second crystal form likely contained the remaining FN2 and FN3 domains of Robo3.

There is a large gap of ~30 Å between the end of the first rod and the beginning of the second (Fig. 2a). This gap is actually connected by the ~15-residue linker between the PSI2 and IPT2 domains (Supplementary Fig. 6), which is invisible in the cryo-EM map and therefore not included in the atomic model. 
Disorder is inferred from missing residues in the cryo-EM map. 
In contrast to class A plexins, the PSI2 and IPT2 domains in PlexinC1 are not rigidly connected to each other due to the flexible linker between them.

Computational secondary structure analysis using PSIPRED (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/) predicted a largely unstructured loop at the N-terminus spanning ~S43–P95. We therefore subjected the purified protein to limited proteolysis by a panel of ten proteases (Proti-Ace &Proti-Ace 2 kit, Hampton Research). Based on the favorable cleavage pattern, we chose trypsin for preparative treatment with protein to trypsin ratio of 500:1 (w/w) and 4°C overnight incubation. The trypsinized sample was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare) in 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl. Mass spectrometry detected peptides from S87 to R373 in the purified sample, indicating a stable domain, which was subsequently shown to retain the enzyme activity.
The overall structure consists of ~300 residues (V93–E391), lacking the N-terminal unstructured loop (~S43–V92) that was removed by limited proteolysis (See Online Methods). 
In the amide-amide proton region of the NOESY spectrum (Fig. 3), we observed sequential NH-NH contacts, which indicated α helical structure in the carboxyl terminus of the peptide(14). Following the assignment of all proton resonances, short range and medium range interactions were defined from the NOESY spectrum. The absence of any long range interactions indicated the lack of a compact tertiary structure or the presence of different conformers rapidly interconverting on an NMR time scale.
Of note, authors describe 3 structured regions, residues 6–9, 18–23, and 37–46. 
"These three structured segments exist autonomously in that they appear to have no interactions with each other or with other portions of the molecule (Fig. 6)."

Upon the addition of Ca(II), the proton spectrum revealed increased dispersion of resonances in all regions of the spectrum (>0.4 ppm from the random coil values) (Fig. 1B). Specifically, there were downfield-shifted amide proton resonances and upfield-shifted methyl proton resonances. In addition, the metal-free and Ca(II)-bound forms of the peptide were in slow exchange on an NMR time scale. For example, the tryptophan indole amide protons from apoFactor IX (1-47) and the Factor IX (1-47):Ca(II) binary complex could be observed simultaneously at 10.25 and 10.19 ppm, respectively. These results suggest that a new structure is adopted following the addition of calcium ions that is different from and likely more structured than the metal-free form.

We now report the three-dimensional structure of
the Ca(II)-bound peptide in solution as determined by NMR
methods. A comparison of this structure with apo-factor IX
(1—47) reveals the nature of the Ca(ID-induced conformational transition in factor IX.
The tertiary structure consists of a large carboxyl-terminal
globular core (residues 13—47) adjacent to a large aminoterminal loop (residues 1-12) (Figure 6)
The domain described by the authors corresponds to residues 47-93 of the UniProt sequence.
Upon occupancy of specific metal bindings sites that interact with many divalent cations, including Mg2+, the Gla domain assumes formal structure except that residues 1–11 remain flexible and motile. 
In contrast, the amino-terminal 11 residues lacked defined structure in Factor IX (1–47)-Mg2+, with the exception of a short loop from residue 6 to 9.
The domain described by the authors corresponds to residues 47-93 of the UniProt sequence.
With occupancy of another set of metal bindings, sites that can be occupied only by Ca2+, the entire polypeptide backbone of the Gla domain is defined, including the NH2-terminal loop (Fig. 5).

Coming from the N-terminus, the electron density around Pro258–Ser259 becomes progressively more disordered, and from around Met299–Asp300 towards the C-terminus, the electron density gets clear again. Blobs of density in between suggest that more residues of the activation loop are still present but not clearly visible due to disorder. 
Residues 260 to 299 (unmodelled in the PDB structure) correspond to residues 288-327 of the Uniprot sequence.
The [15N,1H]-HSQC spectra of the AP-FXIII in water revealed the presence of too many peaks, and the extra peaks were attributed to the presence of cis conformers about the Pro-peptide bonds. The presence of these additional peaks already indicated that AP-FXIII in water was mainly unstructured.
To assess whether segments of the polypeptide chain are folded, a 15N{1H}-NOE experiment was recorded. Typically, amide nitrogen atoms of well-structured regions adopt values larger than 0.5, whereas for fully flexible regions the values are negative. In our experience secondary structure can only be reliably determined by NMR if the H-NOE in the corresponding segment is larger than 0.4. Values of the 15N{1H}-NOE of AP-FXIII are depicted in Figure 5 for both environments. Clearly, no values larger than 0.4 are encountered, and for many residues the heteronuclear NOE is close to 0.2, indicating that they are not fully flexible but that structure determination using NMR is not possible.
These experiments indicated a high conformational flexibility of the peptide in both water and plasma environments, precluding a more detailed structural characterization by NMR.
Recombinant AP-FXIII was largely flexible both in plasma and water, differing significantly from the rigid structure in the bound state. 
Finally, NMR analysis of 15N-labeled recombinant AP-FXIII in water and in plasma proved the peptide to be largely unstructured.

Coagulation factor XIII A chain activation peptide suffers a order to disorder transition upon cleavage. In the bound state, this activation peptide is structured as can be observed in PDB:1EVU
In addition circular dichroism spectra were recorded at physiologic pH 7.0 and the lower pH 5.5. The data indicate that neither α-helical nor β-strand type secondary structural elements become populated at the greater pH value, although slightly more polyproline-type absorption at 208 nm occurs at the greater pH value (data not shown).
The reference is to the structure obtained by X-ray crystallography. In the paper there is no mention to missing electron density but It can be found in the structure
The disordered N-terminal 10 amino acids are indicated by a dotted line , and the locations of the N-terminal disulfide bond( red )and the trypsin cleavage site are indicated.
The position number 10 from the structure (cited in the paper 1UV0) corresponds to position number 36 from UniProt sequence. The statement from the paper claims that the first 10 residues are disordered and actually are 9 residues. 
In particular, N-terminal residues 27–35 are disordered and thus absent from the structure (Fig. 5 A ) and residues 36–41 appear to be involved in crystal packing interactions, raising questions about the observed structure of this essential region of the protein.
These data demonstrate that removal of the N-terminal prosegment by trypsin enhances RegIIIand HIP/PAP antibacterial activity. 
Collectively, these data establish that the RegIII lectin N-terminal prosegment inhibits antibacterial activity in cis, but does not affect peptidoglycan binding.
Overall, these results suggested a model in which the prosegment maintains HIP/PAP in an inactive state through transient interactions between acidic N-terminal residues and basic residues positioned C-terminal to the trypsin site. 
 The inhibitory activity of the N-terminal segment depends on charge-charge interactions with the main body of the protein. Derepression of antibacterial activity occurs when these interactions are perturbed, either through proteolytic removal of the prosegment or by mutation of the charged residues 
This indicates a high degree of backbone conformational mobility at the N terminus. Furthermore, TALOS analyses of backbone chemical shifts (17) and 1H-1H NOEs indicated that the prosegment adopts an extended structure.
The results corresponds to the prosegment specifically for the region comprising residue 27 to residue 37
Together, these data suggest that the prosegment is flexible and transiently interacts with the rest of the protein.
The results corresponds to the prosegment specifically for the region comprising residue 27 to residue 37.
The electron density for the first 15 N-terminal residues and the final 18 C-terminal residues of mature LptE are missing. It is possible that the N terminus of LptE is flexible to allow it to be connected to its membrane anchor at the N terminus, while forming a plug within the lumen of the β-barrel of LptD (11, 15).
The IDR characterized in the publication and spanning residues the N-terminal corresponds to region 20-32 of the amino acid sequence, since the natural precursor form of the protein contains a signal peptide (1-18) that is cleaved in the mature secreted protein.

The disordered C-terminal portion of LptE is consistent with the observation that it is readily cleaved by limited proteolysis of the LptDE complex (11). In any event, genetic studies have established
that this construct is functional (20).
The IDR characterized in the publication and spanning residues the C-terminal corresponds to region 170-182 of the amino acid sequence, since the natural precursor form of the protein contains a signal peptide (1-18) that is cleaved in the mature secreted protein. 
During model building, it became clear that a '50 residue portion of the D-LDH structure is disordered. The disordered region exhibits electron density that is discontinuous and untraceable in both the original multiple-wavelength anomalous diffraction electron density map and the final refined maps. 
Overall Structure. The D-LDH structure is composed of three discontinuous domains: the FAD-binding domain (residues 1–268 and 520–571), the cap domain (residues 269–310, 388–425, and 450–519), and the membrane-binding domain (residues 311–387 and 426–449, of which residues 329–376 are in the disordered region) (Fig. 1).
We propose a model for the association of D-LDH to the membrane. We note that there are nine other positive residues (Lys-331, Lys-336, Lys-344, Arg-346, Lys-353, Lys-355, Arg-358, Arg-364, and Lys-368) in the membrane-binding domain but not modeled in the discontinuous density map. These are shown as yellow balls in Fig. 4. A possible explanation for this disordered segment may be the absence of detergent or lipid in the
crystallization solution. That is, this region may not have a defined structure until it binds the membrane, or it may have a defined structure but with several orientations with respect to the rest of the molecule. Therefore, we propose that positive residues, both from the observed structure and possibly from the missing segment, facilitate the interaction of D-LDH with the negatively charged phosphate groups of the phospholipid membrane.
Another mechanism proposed for association of peripheral membrane proteins with the membrane is through a mixture of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions (4, 5). The membrane-binding domain of D-LDH contains 16 apolar residues, nine in the observed structure and seven in the disordered region. Notably, all of the nine residues in the observed structure are distributed on a surface close to the cap domain and away
from the membrane-binding surface.
Fig. 1. Ribbon representation of the D-LDH molecule complexed with FAD. The three domains are: in cyan, the FAD-binding domain; in purple, the cap
domain; and in blue, the membrane-binding domain. The 50 missing residues
from the membrane-binding domain lie between Met-328 and Ser-375.
A putative model of the 50 missing residues (329–374) (yellow segment in Fig. 4), was built to attach both ends to the structure (residues 328 to 329 and 374 to 375) (blue segment in Fig. 4). This model seems reasonable, given that the solvent content of the crystal is small (30%), which results in tight crystal packing of symmetry-related molecules, especially in the vicinity of the missing residues, constraining the model of this segment.

(blue) and possibly from the modeled missing segment (dashed yellow) comprising nine basic residues (yellow balls) and the negatively charged phospholipid head groups (red balls) of the membrane. 
Residues that are not visible in the crystal structure are indicated with dashed lines

The linkers connecting the head-to-toe dimers consist of a single amino-acid residue (Cys 188 for KH2–KH3 and Leu 343 for KH4–KH5, while the side-by-side positioning of the consecutive KH3–KH4 domains is mediated by a 10-residue-long linker (residues 260–269) that is disordered in the structure.
Results: The linkers connecting the head-to-toe dimers consist of a single amino-acid residue (Cys 188 for KH2–KH3 and Leu 343 for KH4–KH5, while the side-by-side positioning of the consecutive KH3–KH4 domains is mediated by a 10-residue-long linker (residues 260–269) that is disordered in the structure.
The final model includes residues 544–922 of GLD-2 (with the exception of missing or disordered residues between 815–860 and 879–882) and residues 177–222 of RNP-8.
The final model includes residues 546–923 of GLD-2ΔI (with the exception of disordered loops between residues 766 and 773, 804 and 812, 847 and 854, and 876 and 881), residues 25–88 of GLD-3NT, and a chloride ion
Disordered regions are shown with dotted lines. The region deleted for crystallization (residues 813–846) resides in the disordered loop region between α-helices 7 and 8. 
In cUfSP, the ten residues at the N-terminus of all chains, the loops between the a1 helix and b2 strand (residues 34–41) of four chains (chains C, D, E, F), and the regions between b10 and b11 (residues 222–243) of all chains are disordered.

As noted, some parts of the structure (PDB entry 4acr) were partially disordered and were not visible in the initial electron-density map.
Most of the N-terminal extensions were not observed in the current electron density map, whereas the short N-terminal segment of SHR, the N-terminal strap, was observed to extend towards SCR.
The N-terminal 6 residues of SCR (residues 275-280) and 61 residues of SHR (residues 59-119) were not observed in the current map.
The boundaries of the N-terminal region are 59 to 120 according the PDB 5B3G.
A major species-specific feature of RsgA from E. coli is that it possesses an additional N-terminal extension, which is disordered in the crystal structure of RsgA (19) and therefore absent in our atomic model as well (missing residues 1–34). Because of its flexible nature, we were only able to locate partial densities for this N-terminal extension.
 The first 34 residues were cut from the model because of the disorderness in the template.
The RsgA N-terminal extension is disordered in the crystal structure, and thus absent in the atomic model. Partially resolved densities for the N extension show that it interacts with h18, h34, and S3.

Because of its flexible nature, we were only able to locate partial densities for this N-terminal extension. Nevertheless, the map clearly indicates that this extension interacts at least with helix 18 (loop 530) of the body, and helix 34 and S3 of the head (Fig. S2), consistent with the fact that the first 20 N-terminal residues are required for the 30S subunit binding.
The RsgA N-terminal extension is disordered in the crystal structure, and thus absent in the atomic model. Partially resolved densities for the N extension show that it interacts with h18, h34, and S3.
The C-terminal KH and S1 domains (Fig. 1A, residues 566–734) were not visible, containing only broken densities in the electron density maps. These KH and S1 domains were likely disordered as a whole in the crystal structure since they were connected to the second RNase PH domain by a long flexible loop.
The C-terminal KH/S1 domain (marked by dashed circle) was disordered and thus not visible in the crystal structure.
The IDR was separated according to the protein domain composition. This corresponds to the domain "KH".
These results suggest that the structure of DKH/S1 was less compact than full-length PNPase.
To further confirm this observation, the sizes of central channel of full-length PNPase and DKH/S1 mutant were calculated by Hole (Smart et al. 1993). To ensure a fair comparison, disordered side chains or side chains with different conformations in the two structures were removed for the calculation, including the side chains of 105–107, 261–321, 394, and 409–418.
 The IDR characterized in the publication and spanning residues 261–321 corresponds to region 238-298 of the amino acid sequence.

We purified full-length PNPase (Fig. 1A, residues 17–734) and the KH/S1 domain-truncated mutant (Fig. 1A, DKH/S1, residues 17–570), and compared their RNA binding activities by electrophoresis mobility shift assays, using a 20-mer and an 8-mer single-stranded RNA as substrates. The EMSA (Fig. 1B) showed that the full-length PNPase bound 20-mer and 8-mer RNA at concentrations >4 nM, whereas the truncated mutant DKH/S1 bound 20-mer and 8-mer RNA at concentrations >z20 nM.
The KH/S1 domain pair is responsible for direct interaction with RNA.
Our biochemical, circular dichroism, dynamic light scat- tering, and structural results consistently suggest that the KH/S1 domains are involved not only in RNA binding but also in the formation of a compact trimer with a more constricted central channel
We then tested the exoribonucleolytic activity of full- length PNPase and DKH/S1 mutant in time course activity assays. The full-length PNPase digested both 20-mer and 8- mer RNA into small oligonucleotides, as shown in Figure 1C.
These results imply that the KH/S1 domain is involved not only in RNA binding, but also in modulation of enzyme activity in an unknown way.
RNase activities of full-length PNPase and DKH/S1 mutant were assayed by incubation of enzymes, respectively, with 8-mer and 20-mer single-stranded RNAs in time course experiments under the conditions described in Materials and Methods. The left panel shows that DKH/S1 had lower activities in cleaving 20-mer ssRNAs compared to the full-length PNPase. The right panel shows that DKH/S1 cannot degrade shorter 8-mer ssRNAs.
This result showed that the truncated PNPase, without the KH/S1 domain, was melted at lower temperatures and dissociated into monomers in less acidic solutions. Therefore, we conclude that the KH and S1 domains contribute to the formation of a more stable trimeric PNPase.
The KH/S1 domain helps PNPase to form a more stable compact trimer. Our biochemical, circular dichroism, dynamic light scattering, and structural results consistently suggest that the KH/S1 domains are involved not only in RNA binding but also in the formation of a compact trimer with a more constricted central channel.
We conclude that the KH/S1 domains and the upper neck in the channel recruit RNA into the channel, and the lower neck keeps hold of the RNA as it guides it into the PNPase active site for processive degradation. Constrictions of the appropriate size at the necks in the central channel of exosomes and PNPases play a crucial role in RNA binding and processive degradation.

Deep classification of cryo-EM data reveals that the N-terminal helix of S1 acts as an anchor (Fig. 2C), whereas the rest of S1 is extremely dynamic (Movie 1).
However, continuous density was visible only in one or two classes and was not of sufficient quality to dock S1 domains. Overall, this unbiased global classification was useful in that it revealed S1 binding site, however the separation of classes occurred on too many different features of the 70S ribosome and the classes did not reveal domain distribution for S1.
We compared four approaches for deep classification of a ribosome dataset to identify conformational states of a highly dynamic protein S1.
In the next step, a spherical mask around the region of interest, while masking out the large macromolecule using a 3D mask (negative masking), identifies different classes of the mobile protein in the region of interest.
This work highlights that while critical mechanistic insights can be gleaned at the ribosome core of an ensemble of high-resolution structures (Loveland et al., 2017), the same data set does not provide high resolution for a flexible peripheral protein even after exhaustive classification into up to 48 classes.
By contrast, domain 1 (D1), which is connected with the N-terminal helix via a 10-aa linker, is highly dynamic and adopts multiple positions, which differ by up to 50 Å.
While the N-terminal helix is relatively static, the rest of domain 1 is highly dynamic and interacts with S2 in many, but not all, classes.

To visualize the region that the dynamic domains of S1 sample, we superimposed all the modeled domains from 15 classes (Fig. 5E). This superposition revealed that S1 excursions completely cover the 5′ tail of the mRNA upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno helix, rather than adopting preferred conformations that would leave a well-defined path for mRNA exit. Thus, S1 dynamics likely increases the probability of interactions with various mRNA structures near the mRNA exit, allowing S1 to facilitate mRNA association with the 30S subunit during initiation.
 It is possible that the density corresponds to the multiple, interchangeable domains, yielding poor resolution. We have placed D3 in the density on the basis of connectivity with D2, crosslinking of S1 with the 30S subunit (Lauber et al., 2012) and NMR studies that identified the face of S1 domains that interacts with RNA (Aliprandi et al., 2008). One prominent position is near the mRNA tail (Fig. 4A–C). Our finding of one rather than multiple S1 domain bound to the four 5′ mRNA residues is consistent with the observation that S1 domains bind on average 2.5 nucleotides of RNA.
Our cryo-EM maps are also consistent with binding of the C-terminal domains of S1 to the 5′ end of the mRNA and the 3′ end of 16S rRNA at the mRNA exit channel.
The region boundaries are defined by those corresponding to the C-terminal domains of S1.
The bS1 protein comprises six structurally related oligosaccharide-oligonucleotide binding (OB-fold) domains (D1–D6), of which we observe cryo-EM density for D1 to D5 in the hibernating 70S (Fig. 3c,d and Supplementary Fig. 5a,b).
With the exception of bS1-D3, which was highly flexible and poorly ordered (Supplementary Fig. 5b), molecular models could be unambiguously fitted for D2, D4 and D5 of bS1 (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 5e–j).
The IF2 domain IV/ A76-fMet module is linked by flexible regions to the core of IF2 and the body of the tRNA, respectively, to uncouple the motion and to buffer the rotational movement of the 30S subunit. On the IF2 side, a flexible loop connects domain IV that extends from helix 12 of domain III.
The structure of poorly resolved, flexible loops in IF2 was predicted by FragFit, a fragment-based tool for modeling of missing protein segments into cryo-EM density maps (see section below).
Helix 12 of IF2 fades out into a flexible loop that connects domain III and IV while in eIF5b both domains are connected by a more rigid α-helix explaining the different modes of motion employed for repositioning of the initiator tRNA.
The same region is also present in the structure with PDB code "3JCJ".
In both 30S IC-1 and IC-2 maps, a second larger density (purple density in Figure 1B and E) is located at the entrance to the mRNA channel suitable to account for parts of the N1 and N2 domains which were shown by NMR to consist of a small ordered fold and a larger unstructured region (37).
In panels B–C and E–F the star indicates density that we attribute to the G1 domain of IF2 while the dark purple density located on the back of the subunit near the mRNA entrance channel is attributed to the N1/N2 domain of IF2.
The same region is also present in the structure with PDB code "5ME1".
No electron density is present for the 10 N-terminal amino acids, the 2 C-terminal amino acids, for residue 269 and the regions enclosed between residues 154-160, 215-217, and 444-455.
The two loops (215-217 and 444-455) which are disordered in the uncomplexed LysS structure are indicated in magenta.
Whereas in the unliganded enzyme the regions between residues 215-217 and 444-455 are completely disordered, in the lysine-bound structure both segments of polypeptide chain show well-defined electron density.
The two loops that are disordered in the unliganded structure are colored in red. A space filling model of the lysine is shown in yellow.

 A long, polar region (residues 540 –555) that extends from the distal end of the C-terminal domain is disordered in the crystal structure.
To evaluate the significance of the bound cations and to resolve the long, disordered, polar region, we set out to crystallize a C-terminal fragment of BipA consisting of domains III and V and the C-terminal domain in the presence of magnesium ions (Fig. 2A).
The “switch 1” region of BipA (residues 42–65), whose position is affected by the γ-phosphate of GTP in other GTPases, is disordered.
The IDR characterized in the publication with residues 42-65, corresponds to region 32-55 of the amino acid sequence.
In addition, nearly all of the long, basic, disordered region is now structured, and the position of the [Co(NH3 )6 ]3+ ion in the full-length protein structure has been replaced by two proximal magnesium ions.
This evidence comes from a protein fragment.
The switch I region of BipA, which was disordered in all of the isolated structures as mentioned above, can be visualized in the presence of the ribosome (Fig. S3D), allowing us to explore the structural basis of GTPase activation by BipA.

The switch I region of BipA is ordered upon binding to ribosome. In addition to interacting with the GTP analog (GDPCP), the switch I region (Phe32 and Asp33) is stabilized by bilateral contacts with the SRL of the 50S subunit and h8 of the 30S subunit (Fig. 3B), resulting in an ordered structure.
We observed clear density for the first 200 residues of NusA in the PTC60 map (Figures 2A and S4B); the more flexible NusA-CTD was not resolved.
The region characterized as unfolded was folded upon interaction.

In contrast, the active site in the adjacent CED-3 molecule does not have a well-defined conformation, with the L2 loop largely disordered in the crystals'
L2 loop is located in 370-406 region
The structure of BioB has been determined to 3.4 Å resolution by iron multi-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) techniques (21). The fold of each subunit of the BioB dimer is a triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) type (α/β)8 barrel, with two additional helices at the N terminus and a disordered region at the C terminus (Fig. 1).
The first 13 residues of the N-domain were disordered, as were residues from 100 to 120, which comprise a linker to the C-domain.

The linker (100-120 aa) connects N- and C-domains.
Digestion of CFA synthase with a low concentration of trypsin
resulted in two major polypeptide fragments (Figure 3B, inset).
Analysis by sequential Edman degradation showed that cleavage
occurs between Arg111 and Ala112, in the linker between
the N- and C-domains. Following tryptic cleavage, the N- and
C-terminal fragments remained associated during gel-filtration
chromatography (Figure 3B).
The first 13 residues of the N-domain were disordered, as were residues from 100 to 120, which comprise a linker to the C-domain.
The interface between the N- and C-domains is formed by an
extensive network of contacts between the a3 and a4 helices of
the N-domain and the a14 and a18 helices of the C-domain
(Figure 2C). The surface buried in this interface was calculated
to be 1,800 A°2 (Fraczkiewicz and Braun, 1998), representing
34% of the total surface area of the N-domain. A linker must
connect residue 99 in the N-domain with residue 121 in the
C-domain, a distance of 30 A°. However, electron density was
either poor or absent for these linker residues, suggesting that
they adopt multiple conformations.
The intrinsic disorder of PopZΔ134–177 is shown by the 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectrum with the characteristic narrow 1H chemical shift dispersion typically seen for IDPs (Figure S1), with the exception of sidechain amine and amide resonances from arginine and glutamine residues, respectively. Comparatively, ordered proteins tend to have a wider dispersion of 1H resonances than proteins without a well-defined fold.49 The disordered nature of PopZΔ134–177 is further supported by the distinct lack of abundance of long-range interactions in 1H-15N NOESY data. 
The 20 predicted structures show no other well folded secondary structure elements besides an N-terminal α-helix (M10-I17) (Figure 2).
PopZ (1-133) is globally unstructured but retains a short helical motif between residues (M10-I17) according to NMR data.
To determine the extent of structural disorder in this region of PopZ experimentally, we purified the PopZΔ134–177 fragment and analyzed it using solution NMR spectroscopy and circular dichroism. The 2D 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum (Fig. 5C, red signal, and SI Appendix, Fig. S7) shows well-defined peaks with roughly uniform intensities and line shapes for the majority of resonances. Notably, all the backbone proton peaks were clustered in the 7.80–8.85-ppm region. This narrow dispersion of proton chemical shifts is a strong indicator of an intrinsically disordered protein, compared with well-ordered proteins, which exhibit more broadly distributed peaks in the proton dimension (21).
Circular dichroism analysis suggests that PopZ∆134–177 is mostly composed of random coil (Fig. 5B), providing further evidence of structural disorder.
Binding residues were determined by comparing combined ΔHN chemical shifts for each
residue, where peaks undergoing a shift greater than the standard deviation were considered
binding [63]. Combined ΔHN chemical shift perturbations (Figure 3(C)) and peak intensity perturbations (Figure S7) of PopZΔ134-177 upon binding to RcdA reveals that the binding motif of PopZΔ134-177 is between T9-E23 (Figures 4 and S8), as peaks corresponding to these residues undergo both significant chemical shift perturbations and line broadening most likely due to direct interaction with RcdA, although potential secondary structure changes cannot be excluded.
We therefore conclude that residues T9-E23, which include an α-helix that spans M10-I17, act as a MoRF region that is directly responsible for interacting with at least two of its 15 binding partners.

To ask whether the structure of PopZ is affected by interaction with another protein, we repeated our NMR analysis on isotopically labeled PopZΔ134–177, after mixing with RcdA, ChpT, or a noninteracting control protein (Fig. 5C). Whereas the addition of the control protein had little effect on the spectra, the addition of RcdA or ChpT induced significant changes in some of the peaks. Notably, mixing with RcdA or ChpT affected the same set of resonances, suggesting these proteins interact with the same amino acids in PopZΔ134–177. Future analyses will determine whether the affected amino acids are in the N-terminal MoRF-like region, and whether this sequence adopts helical structure on binding

The polar organizing protein Z, PopZ, of Caulobacter functions as a hub protein.
The polar organizing protein Z (PopZ) is necessary for the formation of three-dimensional
microdomains at the cell poles in Caulobacter crescentus, where it functions as a hub protein
that recruits multiple regulatory proteins from the cytoplasm.
Here, RcdA was produced as a fusion protein with
green fluorescent protein (RcdA-GFP) and co-expressed with either full-length wildtype PopZ or
the full-length I17A mutant (each produced as fusions with mCherry for visualization by
fluorescence microscopy). Due to the presence of the C-terminal self-assembly domain in fulllength PopZ, both of the PopZ variants accumulated at the cell poles of the bacteria [39].. RcdAGFP exhibited strong co-localization with wildtype PopZ, but much weaker co-localization with
the I17A mutant, confirming the interaction defect
Caulobacter PopZ forms an intrinsically disordered hub in organizing bacterial cell poles.
We used Escherichia coli cells to screen a pool of candidate proteins for the ability to interact with Caulobacter PopZ (Fig. 1 A–C). This was possible because PopZ self-assembles into macromolecular complexes that accumulate at E. coli cell poles (16), and these can be visualized as brightly fluorescent foci by expressing PopZ as a fusion with mCherry (mChy). When a PopZ binding protein such as ParA-GFP or GFP-ParB is coexpressed with mChy-PopZ, both proteins colocalize in polar foci (7, 16, 17).
Six other candidates exhibited the expected localization patterns for a PopZ binding protein: disperse when expressed without mChy-PopZ, and localized in polar foci with mChy-PopZ when the proteins were expressed simultaneously (Fig. 1C and SI Appendix, Figs. S1–S4).
Removing H3 and H4 (Δ134–177) from the DivIVA-mChy-PopZ fusion protein had no effect on the recruitment of binding partners (Fig. 4C), indicating that the homo-oligomerization and higher-order assembly determinants that enable polar localization of wild-type PopZ are not required for interactions with other proteins.
Loop α2-β5, which is unique to C. elegans, is not seen in the electron density presumably due to disorder and is indicated by a dashed line.
α2 corresponds to residues 90-100 and β5 to residues 132-137 according to Uniprot available data. Thus, loop region corresponds to residues 101-131
Eleven residues from each of the 273-residue monomers are not visible at the carboxyl termini and the polyhistidine tag is not visible at the amino termini in the electron density maps (maps calculated with σA-weighted Fourier coefficients).
The construct actually begins at Phe29 after the signal peptide. The first 15 amino acid residues are mostly disordered in the crystal.
The first 14 N-termnal residues (FSDETLDKVPKSEG) and the last 10 C-terminal residues (DSTFDGVTDK) in the expression construct of the human F-spondin reelin-N domain in this study were not used for the alignment. Most of these residues are disordered in the structure.
The first 10 amino acid residues (29-38) are disordered in the crystal.
As the quality of the electron-density map corresponding to the N-terminal nine residues (29–37, assuming that the mature protein starts with Phe29) and C-terminal 14 residues (185–198) of both molecules was poor, we omitted these segments from the final model.
Thus, the largely disordered N-terminal and C-terminal segments were removed, leaving the core 145-residue portion (Gly42–Ser186, referred to as FSP145).

Thus, the largely disordered N-terminal and C-terminal segments were removed, leaving the core 145-residue portion (Gly42–Ser186, referred to as FSP145).
The N-terminal 15 residues (29-43) are completely missing in two chains and are presumably disordered. 
However, 15 amino acids at the N terminus and 8 amino acids in the reactive center loop were not visible in the final electron density maps.
With the exception of the extreme 15 residues at the N terminus (residues 1–15) and 8 residues in the reactive center loop (residues 353–360), all of the molecule backbone is well ordered in the final crystal structure (Rcryst 18.8% and Rfree 22.7%; Table 1).
Region 1-15 corresponds to region 21-35 of the amino acid sequence.
CK2 phosphorylates PEDF on 2 main residues, Ser24 and Ser114, and PKA phosphorylates PEDF on one residue only, Ser227.
We report here that PEDF purified from human plasma is a phosphoprotein. It is phosphorylated in the serum mainly by CK2 on 2 main residues, Ser24 and Ser114, but also by PKA on Ser227.
Mutation of S24A significantly reduced CK2 phosphorylation (Figure 3), while the S24E mutation reduced phosphorylation only to a moderate extent. The S114A mutant significantly reduced CK2 phosphorylation, while the double mutant S24, 114A almost completely abolished this phosphorylation. We concluded that both Ser24 and Ser114 are the main sites for CK2 phosphorylation of PEDF.
Nonetheless, our results indicate that PEDF is phosphorylated by CK2 mainly on residues Ser24 and Ser114.
The fully CK2 phosphorylation site mutant S24, 114E abolished PEDF neurotrophic activity but enhanced its antiangiogenic activity, while the PKA phosphorylation site mutant S227E reduced PEDF antiangiogenic activity. This is a novel role of extracellular phosphorylation that is shown here to completely change the nature of PEDF from a neutrophic to an antiangiogenic factor.
We found that PEDF is functionally modulated by extracellular phosphorylation. The CK2 phosphorylated PEDF had a reduced neurotrophic activity, while its antiangiogenic activity was significantly increased.
Because of the differences in ERK activation between plPEDF and rPEDF, we used this system to examine whether the phosphorylation mutants indeed mimic the effect of phosphorylation on PEDF activity. When used to stimulate HUVECs, the CK2 phosphorylation site mutants S24A and S24E did not have a significant effect, while S114A and S114E mutants demonstrated slightly reduced ability to stimulate ERK phosphorylation (Figure 4C). However, significant effects were found with the double mutants, as S24, 114A had a reduced effect, while S24, 114E enhanced ERK phosphorylation. These effects were even stronger than the effects of rPEDF or plPEDF. The higher activity of S24, 114E suggests that the 2 Glu residues indeed mimic the activity of phosphorylated PEDF.
The CK2 phosphorylation site mutants S24E/S24A and S114E/S114A had only small effects, as they all induced neuronal differentiation of the Y-79 cells. However, much fewer neurite-like processes and cell aggregates were observed when cells were treated with the S24, 114E mutant. With this mutant, the cells formed small coronalike structures but were very compact without any sprouts projecting from the cells, and this inhibitory effect was stronger than that of plPEDF. On the other hand, cells treated with the S24, 114A mutant exhibit neurite outgrowth and big aggregates similar to rPEDF.
When incubated together with bFGF, the CK2 nonphosphorylated double mutant, S24, 114A, exhibited an antiangiogenic activity that was similar to or slightly less than that of rPEDF, where rearrangement toward vessels could be seen, but clear
vessels did not form. On the other hand, the CK2 phosphorylated mutant, S24, 114E, appeared to be a very significant antiangiogenic factor, even stronger than plPEDF, as it did not allow any vessel formation.
We therefore conclude that phosphorylation of PEDF on its CK2 sites significantly enhanced the antiangiogenic activity of PEDF, while the phosphorylation on its PKA site may slightly reduce its antiangiogenic activity.
As shown in the aortic ring assay, the S24, 114E mutant had even stronger antiangiogenic activity relative to plPEDF, as plugs treated with this mutant had very little angiogenic response. In contrast, plugs treated with bFGF and S227E had much less antiangiogenic activity reflected in many infiltrating vessels. In addition plugs treated with bFGF and S24, 114A mutant or S227A mutant appeared similar to those treated with bFGF and rPEDF (not shown). These results further support that CK2-phosphorylated PEDF enhanced the antiangiogenic activity of PEDF, while the phosphorylation on its PKA site may reduce this activity.
Thus, we observed a CK2-dependent difference in the ability of PEDF to induce neuronal differentiation in retinoblastoma cells where both rPEDF and S24, 114A mutants induced neuronal differentiation, while the S24, 114E had almost no neurotrophic effect.
Thus, S24, 114E appeared to be a very significant antiangiogenic factor, and its inhibitory effect was more pronounced when compared with plPEDF antiangiogenic activity.
Additional support for a functional change of PEDF that is phosphorylation dependent was demonstrated by the degree of ERK activation. A significant effect was found with the double mutants, as S24, 114A reduced ERK activation, while S24, 114E enhanced ERK activation to a higher degree than the stimulation achieved by plPEDF.
We found that both CK2 and PKA phosphorylations of PEDF markedly affect its physiologic function. The fully CK2 phosphorylation site mutant S24, 114E abolished PEDF neurotrophic activity and enhanced its antiangiogenic activity, while the PKA phosphorylation site mutant S227E reduced PEDF antiangiogenic activity.
In structures 4 and 5, the electron density of residues from Ser154 to the C-terminus was not visible, suggesting greater flexibility from this segment.

However, the conformation of these linkers remains unknown due likely to their high flexibility. 
Tandem-repeat-type galectins, like Gal-8, contain two distinct CRDs that are covalently connected via a peptide linker
These studies show that HB-GAM contains two b-sheet domains connected by a flexible linker. Both of these domains contain three antiparallel b-strands. In addition to this domain structure, HB-GAM contains the N and C-terminal lysine-rich sequences that lack a detectable structure and appear to form random coils.
The N-terminal (amino acids 1–14) and C-terminal (amino acids 111–136) areas of HB-GAM are highly flexible, as indicated by the long T2 15N relaxation rates and by the heteronuclear NOE intensities presented in Fig. 4. For some parts of the flexible N and C termini it was not possible to obtain individual assignments because of strong overlap in 1H, 15N, and 13C frequencies (Fig. 1). Also, the linker (amino acids 59–66) shows some flexibility, as indicated by slightly longer 15N T2 and smaller NOE values.
The numbering is shifted since the authors don’t consider the residues in the signal peptide (res 1-32). Therefore, residue 1 corresponds to residue 33 and residue 136 corresponds to residue 168.

Them4 and Them5 proteins contain a highly variable sequence stretch (ca. residues 83 to 109 and ca. residues 91 to 114 for Them4 and Them5, respectively) that is partially disordered in both crystal structures.
According to PDB 4AE8 region that spans residues from 81 to 106 is disordered.
The first 113 residues, as expected, are mostly disordered and account for much of the 'solvent' density. However, there is some electron density, corresponding to about 7  residues, whose assignment remains unknown.
Note that the amino-terminal residues 106 to 114 are out of density but that there is an obvious density region where these residues are positioned in the virus as opposed to the crystal structure.
Missing electron density from the PDB shows the region 1-105 as disordered.
These in turn surround a contiguous layer of density (yellow in Fig. 2b) that is mainly composed of the flexible CP N-terminal region (amino acids 1–113).
(b) Same as (a) but including the layer of unmodeled density that lies immediately below the ordered protease domain layer and is ascribed primarily to the disordered, 113-residue, N-terminal region of CP.
Missing electron density in the PDB shows that the 1-105 region is disordered.
The most striking conformational change induced by substrates/products is that the N-terminal portion comprising residues 187 to 196 becomes disordered, whereas it is a defined α-helix (α0N) in the apo form

βN-(1–62) Does Not Exhibit a Defined Structure in Solution
Furthermore, experiments performed to determine the rates of H/D exchange of amide protons showed that all these protons were exchanged in <3 min., indicating that none of these protons are protected by formation of hydrogen bonds within an “internal structure.” Rather all amide protons are easily accessible from the solvent, as is typical for not compactly folded peptides. In summary, these results indicated that βN-(1–62) does not exhibit a well defined structure in solution, but rather behaves like a flexible peptide showing only transient formation of local structures.
βN-(1–62) is a nonstructured peptide.
As determined from NMR experiments, the hydrophilic N terminus of Kvβ1.1 does not exhibit a well defined, unique three-dimensional structure. Rather it can be described by a fast conformational equilibrium of weakly structured substates.

βN-(1–62) Interacts with the α-Subunit of Kv 1.1 Channels in a Ball-like Manner
The functional characteristics of βN-(1–62) were tested in inside-out patches from Xenopus oocytes expressing non-inactivating Kv1.1 channels. As shown in Fig. 1 B, βN-(1–62) induced rapid inactivation of these channels when present at 50 μm on the cytoplasmic side of the patch; the time-course of inactivation depended on the peptide concentration (not shown). βN-(1–62) blocked Kv1.1 channels only in the open state (Fig. 1 B), similar to IDs derived from Kvα subunits (6, 10).
The interaction between βN-(1–62) and the channel α-subunit was more closely investigated by the “fast application” technique. This technique (see “Materials and Methods”) allows solution exchange at giant inside-out patches in less than 2 ms and enables separate determination for on and off rates of channel-peptide interaction (8,24). Fig. 2, A andB, shows rapid application and wash-off of 50 μm βN-(1–62); these experiments were performed at a membrane potential of 0 mV under asymmetrical K+ conditions ([K+]ex 5 mm, [K+]in 120 mm). Inactivation occurred with a time constant of ≈10 ms (10.3 ± 1.6 ms,n = 3) and was the same whether determined by fast application (left panel, first activation) or in the continuous presence of βN-(1–62) (left, second activation).
The results presented here show that Kvβ1.1 mediates fast inactivation of Kv1α subunits via an N-type mechanism of inactivation. Accordingly, the unique N terminus of Kvβ1.1 comprises a ball-like domain that blocks the channel via interaction with a receptor site that becomes accessible upon channel opening.

Out of the 1,291 residues in cytochrome bo3 ubiquinol oxidase we could assign the sequence for 967 residues (subunit I, 52–81, 96–179, 186–488, 490–520 and 541–552; subunit II, 36–112 and 125–283; subunit III, 19–51, 66–124 and 134–203; subunit IV, 1–109).
Trypsin cleavages at 30 of the possible 48 sites were detected and no cleavage was observed in an internal region (Q85-I179) despite 14 possible cut sites.
The overall experimental results show a protease-resistant, internal core region (Q85-I179) corresponding to the MBD, whereas both the N-terminal region up to position R84 and the C-terminal region beginning at R181 contain multiple accessible cleavage sites.

The so-called 'effector' region in the G domain is disordered and not visible in our maps (residues 38-68). This may reflect the functional flexibility of this region, which is possibly involved in interactions with the ribosome and under goes conformational changes upon GTP hydrolysis (Peter et al.,1990b).

The active GTPase interacts with the effector which may be identical to the GAP or different. GEF may not dissociate until GTP is bound (Boguski and McCormick, 1993), and more complicated interactions between GTPase and GEF may exist (Kaziro et al., 1991).
The N-domain structure does not include residues Gly94-Gln106 due to disorder– the homologous IGFBP-4 residues form a short α-helix which contacts IGF-I.
N-domain molecules are tightly packed within the crystals – of the 118 amino acids in the final model (Gly36 to Ala154, not including Gly94-Gln106), 78 are within 4.5 Å of a neighboring molecule.
Similarly to those of other HtrAs in the inactive state, the active-site loops L1, L2, L3 and LD are severely disordered, impeding the proper function of the catalytic triad, oxyanion hole and S1 specificity pocket (Fig. 1b,c)3,11–13.
Upon activation, loops L1, L2, L3 and LD undergo a disorder-to-order transition yielding a stably folded activation domain.
Some protein segments including residues 158-160, 285-289 (loop LD), 301-314 (loop L3), and 371-480 (PDZ domain) were hardly visible or invisible in these maps and were therefore omitted from the model.
Residues 301-313 (loop L3) are disordered in all ligand-free structures (PDB 3NWU and 3NUM).
Peptide binding is the allosteric activation signal that is transmitted to the protease domain via the sensor loop L3 (nomenclature according to refs. 2,3). Rearrangement of L3 induces the remodeling of the activation domain (loops L1, L2, LD) from the resting into the active conformation, which includes a functional catalytic triad, the oxyanion hole, and substrate-specificity pockets3,4.
Upon activation, loops L1, L2, L3 and LD undergo a disorder-to-order transition yielding a stably folded activation domain.
Our data indicate that ligand binding to the protease domain is sufficient to rearrange the activation domain and loop L3 because, in contrast to what occurs with other serine proteases, substrates interact directly with L3 and complete the activation domain. Therefore, the activity of HTRA1 is controlled by induced-fit substrate binding and does not depend on allosteric ligands acting in trans such as are seen with DegP or DegS4,11,17,19.

The final structure revealed the N-terminal domain of EspB to be organized as a cylindrical heptamer with dimensions of 90 Å x 90 Å and a central channel of 45 Å diameter whereas the C-terminal domain was unstructured.

The linker (86 to 126) and the C-terminal (291 to 460) domains were not visible in the final map and consequently, the atomic reconstruction was not possible for those domains.
Indeed, for each monomer, the atomic model was accurately built from amino acids 8 to 85 corresponding to the PE domain, and from 127 to 290, corresponding to the PPE domain (Fig. 2B), thanks to a high quality density map at medium-resolution (Fig. S1).

In both the native enzyme and pyruvate/Mg(2+) bound forms, the active site loop is completely disordered.
However, significant and unambiguous density was not found in three different places: the N terminal 3–4 residues; the active site loop between fourth β-strand and sixth α-helix (residues 118–129), and the last 6–13 C-terminal residues in different subunits.
In the present case, the active site loop, which includes the critical cysteine residue that acts as the base during catalysis, is completely disordered in both native as well as pyruvate/Mg2+ bound PrpB.

To evaluate the degree of disorder in Ruc, we measured the secondary structures found in Rucred and Rucox using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (reviewed in reference 37). In accordance with structural predictions, both Rucred and Rucox yielded a CD spectrum characteristic of disordered proteins (Fig. 3C) (38).
We therefore propose that Rv0991c, which we named “Ruc” (redox-regulated protein with unstructured C terminus), represents a founding member of a new chaperone family that protects M. tuberculosis and other species from proteotoxicity during oxidative stress. 
Oxidized Ruc prevents unfolded protein aggregation in vitro.
When we measured luciferase aggregation using a different method of detection, light scattering (40), we also observed the inhibition of aggregation by Rucox but not by Rucred (Fig. S1A). Furthermore, chaperone activity by Ruc was observed when Ruc was pretreated with the oxidizing agents hypochlorite or nitric oxide (Fig. S1B), further supporting a model whereby oxidized Ruc counteracts protein aggregation.
In this study, we identified Ruc as the founding member of a new family of bacterial redox-regulated chaperones.
We therefore propose that Rv0991c, which we named “Ruc” (redox-regulated protein with unstructured C terminus), represents a founding member of a new chaperone family that protects M. tuberculosis and other species from proteotoxicity during oxidative stress. 
We therefore asked if the intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain of Ruc was required for its chaperone activity. We produced a truncated Ruc variant, RucNterm (amino acids 1 through 49), which harbors only the zinc-binding motif (Fig. 4B, lane 2). In contrast to the variety of multimers observed for Rucox, oxidized RucNterm (RucNterm-ox) formed a single high-molecular-weight species (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 3 and 4). When we tested the chaperone activity of oxidized RucNterm (RucNterm-ox), we found that it was unable to prevent luciferase aggregation (Fig. 4C). Thus, the disordered C terminus of Ruc is required for its chaperone activity, either by binding to client protein, by influencing the conformation or oligomerization state of Ruc, or through a combination of factors.
In this study, we identified Ruc as the founding member of a new family of bacterial redox-regulated chaperones.
The protein consists of a 23-residue signal peptide for secretion (M1-A23), a flexible linker (G24-R42), an N-terminal
cysteine-rich domain (Q43-P102), four consecutive FAS1 domains (FAS1-1, L103-T238; FAS1-2, I239-K377; FAS1-3, T378-P500; andFAS1-4, P501-N637) with 20% sequence identity to Drosophila fasciclin-1, and a 46-residue C-terminal segment (CTS;
R638-H683), which includes a ‘‘classic’’ integrin-recognition motif (RGD, residues R642-D644; Clout and Hohenester, 2003; Skonieret al., 1992).
In the crystal structure (seeTable 1), the protein was defined for residues Q43-N637, was monomeric, and had an elongated banana shape maximally spanning 120 A˚ (Figure 1A), which is in accordance with low-resolution small-angle X-ray scattering studies (Basaiawmoit et al., 2011).
Finally, based on the relaxation experiment described below, we have determined the C-terminal part (residues A636-Ala657) of the full-length WT FAS1-4 domain (Met502–Ala657) to be unstructured (data not shown).
The protein consists of a 23-residue signal peptide for secretion (M1-A23), a flexible linker (G24-R42), an N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (Q43-P102), four consecutive FAS1 domains (FAS1-1, L103-T238; FAS1-2, I239-K377; FAS1-3, T378-P500; andFAS1-4, P501-N637) with 20% sequence identity to Drosophila fasciclin-1, and a 46-residue C-terminal segment (CTS; R638-H683), which includes a ‘‘classic’’ integrin-recognition motif (RGD, residues R642-D644; Clout and Hohenester, 2003; Skonieret al., 1992).

The RGD motif present in the carboxy-terminus of TGFBI is necessary, but not sufficient, for SKOV3 cell adhesion and is dispensable for adhesion of ovarian cancer cells lacking ß3 integrin expression.
Both TGFBI and periostin contain conserved motifs shown to mediate binding to the integrin receptor family. However, although TGFBI and periostin retain the four conserved fasciclin I domains, periostin contains a longer carboxy-terminus lacking an RGD motif, which is present in TGFBI (Figure 1A). Importantly, the RGD
motif has been implicated in integrin receptor binding and has been shown to be necessary for cell adhesion to various extracellular proteins, including fibronectin [36].
Both TGFBI and periostin contain conserved Fasciclin I and EMI domains, while only TGFBI contains an RGD motif.
Unlike periostin, the carboxy-terminus of rTGFBI supports adhesion of ovarian cancer cells and is dependent on an intact RGD motif
The carboxyterminus of TGFBI (aa 498–683), which contains the fourth fasciclin I domain and the RGD motif, was capable of supporting SKOV3 cell adhesion similar to fulllength rTGFBI. However, the fourth fasciclin I domain alone (aa 498–637), previously shown to support HUVEC and human fibroblast cell adhesion [15,43], and the central domain (aa 24–506) were unable to support SKOV3 adhesion (Figure 5B, 5C). Furthermore, mutagenesis of the RGD motif to amino acid residues RAE in the carboxy-terminal truncated form of TGFBI (aa 498–683) abrogated adhesion of SKOV3 cells (Figure 5B, 5C).
To further understand how the fourth fasciclin I domain and the RGD motif cooperate with other TGFBI domains, we evaluated whether mutation of the RGD motif to amino acid residues RAE would affect the ability of full-length TGFBI to support SKOV3 adhesion. In these experiments we found that the RGD to RAE mutation in full-length TGFBI significantly reduced SKOV3 adhesion (Figure 6A).
Therefore, we tested whether the ERGDEL peptide derived from TGFBI was capable of competitively inhibiting adhesion of ovarian cancer cells to fibronectin and rTGFBI. Pretreatment of cells with the classical fibronectin
GRGDSP peptide was capable of inhibiting adhesion to both fibronectin and rTGFBI (Figure 6B). By contrast, pretreatment with the TGFBI ERGDEL peptide did not alter adherence to fibronectin and rTGFBI (Figure 6B). Therefore, the RGD motif of TGFBI is necessary, but is not sufficient, to support adhesion of SKOV3 cells and
binding either requires a greater number of flanking amino acids or a complex with the fourth Fasciclin I domain.
Our results suggest that the RGD motif of full-length TGFBI is necessary, but not sufficient, for ovarian cancer cell adhesion, thus indicating it may cooperate with flanking residues or other motifs, potentially present within the fourth Fasciclin I domain to mediate this process. Importantly, we found that the TGFBI derived RGD peptide (ERGDEL) was unable to competitively inhibit SKOV3 adhesion to rTGFBI, suggesting its use as a therapeutic agent to inhibit TGFBI function may depend on the cellular context.
RGD motif (642-644) with flanking residues.
Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that TGFBIp interacted with integrin αVβ3.
Previous studies demonstrated that TGFBIp interacts directly with several integrins, including αVβ3, through mechanisms dependent and independent of the RGD binding motif [56,57]. These data suggest that the RGD motif mediates the internalization of TGFBIp through interaction with integrins.
TGFBIp interacts with integrin αVβ3 and αV.
We also examined the potential association of TGFBIp with αVβ3 integrin by co-immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates from corneal fibroblasts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies against integrin αV or αVβ3, and the resulting immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the presence of TGFBIp by western blot. Our data demonstrate that TGFBIp was coimmunoprecipitated by both integrin αV and αVβ3 antibodies (Fig 6B), suggesting the association between integrin αVβ3 and TGFBIp.
Taken together, these data demonstrate that TGFBIp is internalized via the interaction of αVβ3 or/and αVβ5 integrins with an RGD-motif in TGFBIp.
TGFBIp is internalized via a caveolin-dependent endocytic pathway and transported to the lysosomes for degradation. This internalization is mediated by RGD motif-dependent binding of TGFBIp to integrin αVβ3 or αVβ5.
Moreover, we showed that TGFBIp interacted with αV integrin, and that RGD peptide inhibited TGFBIp internalization in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that the RGD motif could mediate interaction with integrins, even though TGFBIp is also able to interact with integrins in the absence of this motif [71].

Consistent with these results, confocal microscopy analysis showed the co-localization of internalized TGFBIp and integrin αV in corneal fibroblasts (Fig 6C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that TGFBIp is internalized via the interaction of αVβ3 or/and αVβ5 integrins with an RGD-motif in TGFBIp.

Moreover, treatment with arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) tripeptide suppressed the internalization of TGFBIp.
These data suggest that the RGD motif mediates the internalization of TGFBIp through interaction with integrins. Therefore, we evaluated whether RGD-mediated interactions of TGFBIp with integrins are involved in its internalization. Exogenous human TGFBIp was incubated with corneal fibroblasts in the presence of either RGD peptide or control RAD peptide for 2 h. In the presence of the RGD peptide, the amount of internalized TGFBIp was reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 6A, left panel). However, intracellular TGFBIp levels did not change in cells incubated with the control RAD peptide (Fig 6A, right panel). These results suggest that RGD peptides disrupt TGFBIp internalization by preventing its endocytosis from the ECM.

In analytical SEC experiments, human G0S2 eluted as a single peak (Figure ​Figure2A) with a retention volume corresponding to a Stokes radius (RS) of 18.8 Å. This value is 1.1 times larger than the theoretical value of 17.5 Å that can be calculated assuming that human G0S2 has a globular structure and a molecular weight of 11.3 kDa (Figure ​Figure2B).20 This difference resulted in being significant by means of a t-test of one sample (P = 0.0003). The experimental volume was 28.0 Å3, which was higher than the theoretical volume (22.4 Å3), while the experimental density of 0.4 kDa/Å3 was lower than the theoretical value (0.5 kDa/Å3, Table 1).
The extended conformation in human G0S2 could be explained in at least two possible ways. It may be due to a partially swelled tertiary structure, which would generate a globular conformation with larger dimensions, as in the case of a molten globule (MG). In this regard, the observed RS value (18.8 Å) is smaller compared to the expected RS value for an MG (19.9 Å).20 Alternatively, the extended conformation could also be attained by the presence of a disordered and extended region exposed to the solvent; in this case, the protein would have a globular domain with an extended segment that would generate an elongated conformation with the observed Rs.
Our SEC and DLS results suggest that the human G0S2 protein has an elongated shape with a globular domain of approximately 8 kDa.
To gain further insights into the molecular shape of human and mouse G0S2 proteins, DLS measurements were subsequently carried out to calculate the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) for each protein. The size distribution of protein samples showed the presence of a single species with an apparent Rh of 1.4 ± 0.03 and 1.7 ± 0.02 nm, human and mouse G0S2, respectively (Figure3A).
Interestingly, the Rh obtained for the human G0S2 protein was smaller than the calculated RS value of 1.9 nm determined by SEC, indicating that this protein diffuses like a smaller protein in solution with an apparent size of 8 kDa.
The elongated conformation of the human G0S2 could be explained by the presence of a disordered C-terminal region, as suggested by the bioinformatic analysis. Indeed, a theoretical molecular weight of 7.5 kDa can be calculated for human G0S2 by omitting the C-terminal region, which is in accordance with the observed Rh value.
Our SEC and DLS results suggest that the human G0S2 protein has an elongated shape with a globular domain of approximately 8 kDa.
Secondary Structure Content Analysis Reveals That G0S2 Is Largely Unstructured.
To gain more insight into the structural content of G0S2, we used circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy in the far UV region.31 The human and mouse G0S2 CD spectra exhibit properties previously observed for IDPs. They show a strong minimum signal close to 200 nm (−11.67 × 10–3 and −12.05 × 10–3 deg·cm2·dmol–1, human and mouse G0S2, respectively) and a small negative contribution close to 222 nm (−2.55 × 10–3 and −1.48 × 10–3 deg·cm2·dmol–1, human and mouse G0S2, respectively) (​Figure 5A).
 No electron density was observed for amino acids 1–7, 34–39, 316–321, 330–334, and 354–end, therefore these residues were not included in the model.
In fact, the experimental data indicate that the protein resembles a “molten globule” under physiological conditions.
bis-ANS binding experiments show that the hydrophobic core is accessible to the solvent at neutral pH, and more so at low pH.
In fact, the experimental data indicate that the protein resembles a “molten globule” under physiological conditions.
The differences between the 1D NMR spectra of the native (Figure 8a) and the urea-denatured YP2β protein (Figure 8c) confirm the existence of a partly structured state at pH 7 clearly different from a fully unfolded one.
The fact that all the amide protons of the protein exchange so quickly with solvent suggests that no stable tight structured region exists in the protein.
Incubation of both proteins was followed by far-UV CD and 1D-NMR measurements, and spectra were compared with those of the isolated proteins under the same conditions. The CD spectra of the protein mixture, when compared to the arithmetical addition of spectra from the individual proteins indicate that some secondary structural changes take place upon incubation of both proteins together (Figure 9A).

Protein interactions seems to increase the secondary structure of one or both proteins.
Protein P2α protects protein P1β from degradation.
 As shown above, transformation of S.cerevisiae W303-1b with the P1β-encoding multicopy plasmid alone causes an increase in expression of this protein. This increase was notably smaller than the increase detected when P2 protein was overexpressed, due to the higher sensitivity of P1 proteins to degradation.
Except for residues 1–18, 25–29, and 234–245, the main chain is well defined by the electron density
The first ~30 residues, bearing the major heparin binding site (7), are unique for NC4. Unfortunately these N-terminal residues were largely unresolved both in the crystal structure and NMR chemical shift assignments
Residues 1-18 mentioned by the authors corresponds to residues 24-41 of the uniprot entry. The numbering used by the authors starts after the signal peptide.
NC4 Lacking the N Terminus Has Only Residual Heparin Affinity—To verify our initial mapping of the heparin binding site of NC4 to the N terminus of the domain (7), we created mutant NC4Ndel lacking the first 17 residues of the domain. Analytical heparin affinity chromatography showed that N-terminally truncated NC4 could not bind to the column at a physiological salt concentration. When bound to the column in a buffer containing no added NaCl, NC4Ndel eluted at 0.13 M salt compared with the 0.31 M salt required for elution of wild-type NC4 (Fig. 5).
In vitro mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to create a mutant form of NC4, termed NC4Ndel, lacking the first 17 residues of the mature polypeptide
The mutant used by the authors lacks residues 24-40 of the uniprot entry of this protein
In an attempt to characterize the NC4 domain in more detail, we set up a prokaryotic expression system to produce the domain. The purified 27.5-kDa product was analyzed for its glycosaminoglycan-binding potential by surface plasmon resonance and solid-state assays. The results show that the NC4 domain of collagen IX specifically binds heparin with a Kd of 0.6 µM, and the full-length recombinant collagen IX has an even stronger interaction with heparin, with an apparent Kd of 3.6 nM. The heparin-binding site of the NC4 domain was located in the extreme N terminus, containing a heparin-binding consensus sequence.
Identification of the Heparin-binding Region of the NC4 Domain—Alkylated rNC4 was digested with V8 protease and the resulting mixture of peptides subjected to heparin affinity chromatography. Analysis of the peptide mixture by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry along with unbound and bound material from the affinity chromatography revealed that the extreme N-terminal peptide (amino acids 1–19, monoisotopic mass 2098.078) was able to bind to heparin, whereas other fragments were not. 
Our results show that the NC4 domain can now be added to the growing list of extracellular matrix proteins that interact with heparin or heparan sulfate
The peptide identified by the authors corresponds to residues 24-42 of the uniprot entry of this protein

The heparin-binding site of the NC4 domain was located in the extreme N terminus, containing a heparin-binding consensus sequence.
The N-terminal 19-amino acid fragment was subsequently prepared as a synthetic peptide (peptide 1–19), which was shown to bind to heparin-Sepharose and elute upon introduction of about a 0.15 M concentration of NaCl (i.e. a 40% smaller concentration than was required for the elution of native rNC4). CD analysis of peptide 1–19 indicated that it was largely devoid of secondary structure (data not shown).
Our results show that the NC4 domain can now be added to the growing list of extracellular matrix proteins that interact with heparin or heparan sulfate.

A mutant form of rNC4, carrying a sequence NGL in place of the basic amino acid sequence KRR of the suspected heparin binding site, was created. Using heparin affinity chromatography, it was demonstrated that this mutant rNC4 was unable to interact with heparin at physiological conditions. Comparison of the mutant rNC4 with wild-type rNC4 by far-UV CD analysis (data not shown) and by FTIR spectroscopy (Fig. 6) showed that the mutation did not affect the secondary structure of the NC4 domain
Collagen XI, for example, possesses several heparin-binding sequences, two of which comply with the heparin-binding consensus sequence XBBXBX, where B denotes a basic amino acid and X is any other amino acid (25). A sequence KRRPRF matching this consensus is present in the extreme N-terminal region of the NC4 domain of collagen IX and is indeed shown here to be the site of interaction of the domain with heparin. This sequence motif is also present in the N terminus of the mouse collagen a1(IX) chain (26). Comparison of this sequence of NC4 with a reported distribution of residues in known heparin-binding proteins (27) further implicates the sequence as a potential heparin-binding site.
To analyze the interaction of COMP in a more reliable one-to-one situation, we used a biotinylated recombinant 57-kDa C-terminal fragment of the COMP monomer (COMP T3 TC) to coat a hydrophobic sensor chip. Soluble rNC4 was injected over the surface at various concentrations, and a Kd of 0.23 ± 0.11 M
The same sensor chip was also used to analyze the effect of excess heparin on the interaction of COMP T3+TC with rNC4 and rcIX. Heparin was found to inhibit both interactions at low micromolar concentrations. Preincubation of 20 nM rcIX with 4 M heparin (molecular mass 6 kDa) prior to injection over the coated surface resulted in more than 99% inhibition of the interaction with COMP T3+TC, and 50% inhibition was achieved with a heparin concentration lower than 0.1 M.
Somewhat surprisingly, our results show that COMP and heparin compete for the same binding site or overlapping ones in the NC4 domain. Similarly, we were able to block the interaction of full-length rcIX with the C-terminal domain of COMP using relatively low heparin levels.
Chain A is the only molecule visible in full length in the ΔN-HtrA3 structure. It encompasses residues 135–459 with the exclusion of residues 163–168 and 277–289 of the loops LA and L3, respectively.
The fact that parts of the LA and L3 loops (Fig 3) were not visible in the ΔN-HtrA3 structure suggests their mobility and thus the possibility that they change conformation upon substrate binding. Similarly, the L3 loop is not visible in the HtrA1 and the E. coli HtrA(DegP) inactive structures, but is present in the active conformations [9] [56].
Residues 279-289 are missing in all chains and are presumably disordered.
Only the CUB module (residues 128–249) was visible in the crystal structure with no electron density seen for the last 28 amino acid residues, although this region was verified as present in the crystals by SDS-PAGE (not shown). The last residue observed in the electron density is Pro-249, which protrudes into a large solvent channel; this might allow the C-terminal region to adopt a range of conformations, thus rendering it essentially invisible to crystallography.
Most of the SMC1 and SMC3 coiled coils (CCs), large segments of the flexible region of RAD21, and the N- and C-terminal unstructured parts of STAG1 and NIPBLC were completely unresolved.

Since the SA1 protein was also nuclear in yeast, we asked whether the putative 19-amino acid-long bipartite NLS present in the N-terminal non-conserved part of this protein was responsible. The sequence 34KRKRGRPGRPPSTNKKPRK53 is specific to SA1 and is not homologous to the identified functional NLS32–47 of SA2L. Deleting K34–K53 resulted in the localization of SA1Δ34–53 in the whole cell, which confirmed that the signal is necessary for SA1 nuclear import. When we fused 71 N-terminal amino acids of SA1 containing this signal to GFP, the fusion protein SA11–71-GFP localized to the nucleus, confirming that it contained a functional NLS (Figure 5).

The IDR characterized in the publication and spanning residues 580-621 in the experimental construct corresponds to region 511-552 of the amino acid sequence.
Residues 84-92, 145-149, 231-237, 580-621, and 712-715 are disordered in the structure.
The carbon-associated 1H resonances of the Par17 N-terminus up to residue Gly59, however, are missing due to a very high degree of resonance degeneracy within this apparently unstructured region.
Signals belonging to the first 60 N-terminal residues of Par17 show a low amide proton resonance dispersion (between 8.55 and 8.01 ppm), indicating that this region of the protein is largely unstructured.
Subsequent chemical shift index analysis indicated that Par17 features a parvulin-type PPIase domain at the C-terminus, analogous to Par14, and an unstructured N-terminus encompassing the first 60 residues.
The Par17 protein differs from Par14 within the N-terminus by 25 additional amino acids.
Par17-RS- and -QR-EGFP co-localized with mitochondrial staining. Totals of 77 ± 5 and 63 ± 9% of EGFP fluorescence were measured to overlap with the MitoTracker signal for Par17-RS and -QR, respectively. Par14-EGFP fluorescence is equally distributed throughout the cytosol and partially enriched in the nucleus, as has been described previously. Co-localization values were far lower for Par14-EGFP (11 ± 6%) and EGFP alone (4 ± 1%). Therefore, the presequence seemed to be the determinant for mitochondrial targeting, and the question arose whether the Par17 N-terminus was necessary and/or sufficient for mitochondrial targeting.
The hPar14 folds into aba3bab2 structure, and contains an unstructured 35-amino acid basic tail N-terminal to the catalytic core that replaces the WW domain of hPin1  homolog.
Poorly dispersed resonances of amino acid residues Lys4 to Gly35 within the amid region   of TOCSY and COSY-spectra point to the fact that these residues are localized in random  coil areas. Confirmation comes from the evaluation of NOESY spectra where only sequential NOEs of neighboring residues within this sequence were found. 
In agreement with the presence of 27 % Pro residues, the G1 to W64 segment is largely unstructured with Cα and CO chemical shifts close to random coil values and IUPred scores larger than 0.55.
We also provide evidence for a two-domain organization of LpoB and a largely disordered, 64 amino acid-long N-terminal domain.
The first four residues of the analyzed sequence construct belonged to a tag that replaced the signal peptide. Valine 21 was the first UniProt residue being part of the construct (equivalent to residue 5 in the construct).
The N-terminal region of hDkk4 (M1–G21) and the relatively long linker between the two cysteine-rich regions (E77–Q123) appear to be unstructured and relatively mobile.
The N-terminus of the protein (M1–S21), the non-conserved linker (E77–Q123) between the two cysteine-rich regions and the C-terminal histidine-tag (E208–H222) are characterised by relatively intense and close to random coil chemical shifts for backbone amide signals, which together with predicted order parameters of 0.3–0.7 from TALOS+ for residues 2–22, 81–122 and 206–217 suggests that these regions are unstructured and relatively mobile compared to the cysteine-rich regions.
The mature form of the protein was studied UniProt (19-224), with an extra Met at the N-terminus and a tag at the C-terminus. Therefore there is a shift in the residue numbering and G21 in the construct is equivalent to G38 in the UniProt sequence.

The mature form of mitochondrial Tb1-C-Grx1 (residues 42–184) was analyzed by NMR.
Although the good dispersion of peaks observed in the 15N-HSQC of Tb1-C-Grx1 WT clearly indicates that the protein is well folded in aqueous buffer, resonance assignment showed that the majority of the signals generated by the residues of the N-terminal tail resonate within a relative narrow region in the proton dimension. This feature suggests that the 35-mer N-terminal region is a largely unstructured element.
The first 35 residues of the mature protein are equivalent to UniProt residues 42-76.
The residues belonging to the NTE show a poor dispersion of the proton chemical shifts
in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum. Most of these peaks cluster in the region between 8 and 8.5 ppm, with significantly higher intensities than average.
Cα secondary chemical shifts are highly sensitive probes for local conformation; most residues of the tail present absolute values below 0.5 ppm, which is typical of non-structured elements.
The model-free order parameters estimated with the RCI method show that most residues from the NTE present values consistently lower than the average value of 0.7 of the globular domain.
In contrast, hetNOE values below 0.4 were obtained for all residues upstream L70 providing additional evidence that the NTE is largely unstructured.
The plot of 1H-15N RDCs as a function of the residue number confirm that the NTE is largely disordered, presenting for most of the residues RDC absolute values below 3 Hz, hence significantly smaller than the average for the globular domain (7.2 Hz).
Assuming that the protein is monomeric, from the measured hydrodynamic radius it is possible to calculate for FL 1CGrx1 a compaction factor of 0.73, which is fully in agreement with the presence of a structured domain of around 100 residues, namely the Grx domain, and a disordered region of about 40 residues, the NTE.
Interestingly, the portion comprising residues 65–76 of the NTE modulates the conformational dynamics of the glutathione-binding pocket, which may play a role in iron-sulfur cluster assembly and delivery.
Comparison of the 1H-15N-HSQC spectra of Δ76 and FL 1CGrx1 revealed shifts in a significant number of peaks, which can be ascribed to structural rearrangements caused by the presence of the NTE.
Notably, the peak pattern of the 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum from Δ64 1CGrx1 is essentially identical to that observed for the full-length protein. This result clearly shows that the segment comprising amino acids L65 to M76, (i.e., the C-terminal part of the NTE), is responsible for modulating the conformational dynamics of FL 1CGrx1.
Altogether, our results support a pivotal role for residues 65-76 of the N-terminal tail of FL 1CGrx1 in modulating the structural dynamic properties of the binding pocket through a network of polar and hydrophobic interactions between residues from α1 and α3.
The chemical shift perturbation (CSP) is evident not only for α1, to which the NTE is connected, but also for α3 and the downstream loop containing the conserved cis-proline. Mapping the CSP on the bundle of conformations for FL 1CGrx1 clearly shows that the regions of the protein most affected by the presence of the NTE correspond to those where the structure is less well defined because of internal mobility, as already described in the previous section.

Based on size exclusion chromatography (SEC), we have previously proposed that the NTE may promote the formation of non-covalent dimers in apo-1CGrx. Considering the IDR nature of the NTE and its potential contribution to an anomalous behaviour of 1CGrx1 in solution, we revisited this hypothesis by applying three complementary experimental approaches.
After filtering out residues from flexible regions or involved in chemical exchange processes, we estimated τc = 9.5 ± 0.5 ns for FL 1CGrx1, which is fully compatible with a monomeric and not a dimeric state, as previously assumed. Not surprisingly, this value is significantly larger than the previously measured τc for the Δ76 mutant (7.9 ± 0.6 ns) due to the expanded size of the protein containing the unstructured NTE.
After optimization of the cleavage conditions, trypsin treatment of FL 1CGrx1 yielded protein cleaved between K64 and L65, as confirmed by mass spectrometry, and therefore named Δ64 1CGrx1.
Here we present the first NMR solution structure of a Pseudomonas MT, PflQ2 MT, using the strain P. fluorescens Q2-87. It consists of a metal binding domain and an intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail, that was not observed in other MTs so far.
To experimentally confirm this prediction but also to investigate the influence of the tail on the metal binding abilities and on the structure, the full-length protein PflQ2 MT and its shortened version, lacking the tail, (sh_PflQ2 MT) were compared using NMR and optical spectroscopy.
MT refers to Metallothionein. In the methods the authors state that "The shortened version of the protein lacking the C-terminal tail, sh_PflQ2 MT (residues 1-52)", these residues are equivalent to UniProt residues 2-53, therefore the C-terminal tail must span UniProt residues 54-82
Backbone dynamics studies show a gradual decrease of 15N{1H}-NOE values from residue R51 on, which, however, only level off to -0.5 after residue 76. This indicates that there is still some, albeit rather loose, interaction of the tail with the folded part of the protein, and that it resembles a molten globule.
The disordered C-terminal tail has never been observed in other MTs so far. We
could demonstrate that this tail has no influence on the metal binding properties of the Pseudomonas MT and does not change the overall protein fold.
The secondary structure of SNX3 was predicted from Hα, Cα, Cβ, C′ chemical shifts using Ccpnmr analysis suite and the corresponding chemical shift index. Three β-strands (29–39, 46–55, 64–69) followed by three α-helices (71–84, 112–130, 133–145) were predicted, consistent with the structural characteristics of PX domains and SNX12-PX in particular. The third helix may contain an irregularity midway based on an interrupted CSI pattern, while both termini exhibit random coil resonances and are intrinsically disordered.

In lieu of the D-loop, the Sf6 I-domain appears to have a new disordered loop between strands 5 and 6 of the β-barrel that is not observed in P22 or CUS-3.
For each protein the following are shown: amino acid sequence, residues protected from hydrogen exchange (indicated by filled circles), secondary structure prediction from sequence calculated with the JPred program, chemical-shift based secondary structure prediction calculated with TALOS-N (except for P22 where the schematic is based on the NMR structure) and prediction of backbone dynamics from TALOS-N where the green symbols “x” indicate flexible regions with small predicted S2 order parameters (except for P22 where the dynamics information is based on 15N-relaxation measurements).
Human uracil N-glycosylase isoform 2—UNG2 consists of an N-terminal intrinsically disordered regulatory domain (UNG2 residues 1–92, 9.3 kDa) and a C-terminal structured catalytic domain (UNG2 residues 93–313, 25.1 kDa).
In Figure 1 the N-HSQC spectrum of N-UNG2 (residues 1-92) shows very narrow peak dispersion that is typical for IDPs.
Lack of any significant chemical shift changes indicates no interaction between the disorder N-UNG2 region and structured catalytic domain C-UNG2. 
The chemical shifts of HN, N, C′, Hα, Cα and Cβ were used to calculate secondary structure elements by TALOS+ (Shen et al. 2009) and SSP (Marsh et al. 2006). TALOS+ was developed to predict stable secondary structure elements while SSP was made for disordered proteins and therefore allows a more detailed view of the disordered regions. Both programs show similar predictions of N-UNG2 and C-UNG2. Both programs predict that the first 60 amino acids of N-UNG2 are intrinsically disordered followed by a long helical part from Ser67-Ala86.
These assignments reveal that the protein consists of seven α-helices, and that the arachidonic acid is bound tightly to the protein. Comparison with the chemical shift assignments of the apo-form of the protein reveals that binding of the fatty acid is accompanied by a large conformational change in the C-terminal helix, which appears disordered in the absence of lipid.
There are large chemical shift differences between the apo and bound states of AeOBP22 in multiple locations in the protein, with the largest differences localized to the C-terminal residues 104–123. A comparison of the calculated secondary structure propensities for the apo and bound states reveals that the overall secondary structure of the protein is maintained throughout most of the protein between the apo and bound states. In contrast, the C-terminal residues are significantly less ordered in the apo state.
The location of the predicted alpha-helical regions in the bound state is shown in the panel above as blue bars. For the apo-protein there is a clear break in the predicted secondary structure at residue 111.
In the UniProt sequence there is a signal peptide of 16 residues that was not included in the experiment, so there is a shift of 16 residues in the numbering. Residue 111 is equivalent to UniProt residue 127.

HDX–MS analysis of PTEN-L-6A (Supplementary Figure S9A) indicated that the first 145 residues of PTEN-L were intrinsically disordered as previously predicted [31], exhibiting very high levels of HDX–MS (>50% exchange at 3 s of exchange at 0°C). However, one region of the N-terminal extension of PTEN-L, residues 145–176, was below this threshold, suggesting that this region may be folded and forming an α-helix, as suggested by secondary structure prediction programs.
To determine whether this sequence conferred similar properties to PTEN-Long, we constructed a PTEN-LongΔR6 construct in which these six arginines were deleted (Fig. S18). After treating cells with 100 nM purified Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP)-V5/His, PTEN-Long-RFP-V5/His, or PTEN-LongΔR6-RFP-V5/His, we detected PTEN-Long-RFP but not RFP nor PTEN-LongΔR6-RFP in the cells by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3A, Fig. S19).
Inhibition of PI3K signaling appeared to be dependent upon the poly-arginine sequence of PTEN-Long because the PTEN-LongΔR6 mutant did not block Insulin or EGF-induced phosphorylation of AKT (Fig. S24).
 According to the RCI-S2 values provided by TALOS-N (Fig.2.c), the disordered (residues 600‒645) and ordered (residues 646‒739) regions are clearly differentiated.
A large fraction of the peaks of the presented HSQC spectrum show narrow peak dispersion and fall to the ppm range tipical for IDPs.
The first 37 residues at the N-terminus are unstructured.
In this publication the authors solved the crystal structure of the VP35 NPBP/ΔNPNTD complex. ΔNPNTD comprised the residues 25–457 of the Zaire ebolavirus (strain Mayinga-76) nucleoprotein.
All four ΔNPNTD molecules are present in the structure. However, the head lobes of molecules B and D show a high degree of disorder with corresponding high average and individual B-factors (Table S1 and Figure S3D). The B-factors indicate that the conformations of head lobes in symmetrically-equivalent copies of these molecules across the crystal lattice differ in their orientation by 1–2 Å. 
In this publication the authors solved the crystal structure of the VP35 NPBP/ΔNPNTD complex. ΔNPNTD comprised the residues 25–457 of the Zaire ebolavirus (strain Mayinga-76) nucleoprotein. They identified a head lobe spanning NP residues 38 to 240.
The cytoplasmic tail residues are mostly disordered but an extended backbone conformation is adopted by the LC3 binding motif and the putative M1 interaction site has partial helical content with a small pH-dependence.
All measured heteronuclear NOEs were negative, indicating that the distal cytoplasmic tail was highly dynamic throughout. 
Backbone amide resonances for residues 44–64 were largely missing due to chemical exchange broadening.
The whole cytoplasmic tail of MP2 (residues 44-97) was found to be disordered based on heteronuclear NOEs. Within this longer region, residues 44-64 were also affected by chemical exchange broadening.
A membrane proximal cytoplasmic region (residues ~ 46–97) contains a membrane-interacting amphipathic helix (APH; residues ~ 46–62) that is important in lipid raft targeting and virus scission.
HMQC spectra of the M2-APH-CT construct were acquired in the presence of 50 mM LMPC:LMPG micelles (4:1) or POPC:POPG liposomes (4:1; 17 mM total lipid) at pH 7.2. The detectable amides of the APH residues Gly58 and Gly62 were perturbed upon addition of the membrane mimetics. By contrast, none of the detectable resonances for residues outside of the APH were perturbed upon addition of either micelles or liposomes at pH 7.2 or pH 5.5, consistent with there being no interactions of the distal cytoplasmic tail with membranes.
Order parameters, S2, derived by comparing CSI versus RCI values, indicate an increased flexibility for the 33 C-terminal residues of RbfA.
Limited  tryptic  proteolysis  of purified   full-length   RbfA   revealed   preferential cleavage   at   residue   Arg108,   indicating   that   the C-terminal  25  residue  sequence  is  susceptible  to digestion by protease and possibly flexible.
A  limited  trypsin  proteolysis  revealed  that  RbfA indeed  contained  an  easily  degradable  portion and   a   relatively   compact   region   resistant   to moderate  proteolysis .  The  molecular mass of the trypsin-resistant fragment was determined   to   be   12,143 Da   by   mass   spectroscopy, which  corresponds  to  an  RbfA  fragment  with  its C-terminal 25 residues truncated. 
The limited proteolysis data suggest that RbfA may have a C-terminal extension that is poorly  structured at least when the protein exists free from ribosomes.
In order to test whether the C-terminal regions of RbfA share a similar function, we studied the cellular localization of RbfAD25 by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation   followed by Western blotting. In cells expressing exogenous full-length RbfA, although the majority of the protein existed in soluble fractions, a significant amount co-fractionated with 30 S ribosomal subunits. In contrast, the truncated protein existed exclusively in the soluble fractions,  indicating that the C-terminal region of RbfA is required for its stable binding to 30 S subunits.
The construct studied includes the previously characterized core domain, which incorporates acidic tract A1 (29), and additionally contains the complete N terminus and a disordered C-terminal segment (residues 123–130) containing a CK2 phosphorylation site (Ser125) (20) and acidic tract A2 associated with histone chaperone activity (30).
The N- and C-termini are highly flexible and are not observed in the structure.
CD spectra confirmed that, in solution, Npm-N exhibited β-sheet secondary structure in the presence of 0.15 M NaCl (termed the “high-salt” form; Fig. 2C, blue trace). However, in the absence of NaCl (termed the “low-salt” form; Fig. 2C, red trace), Npm-N was disordered.
CD wavelength scans of disordered Npm-N in the absence of NaCl (red) and folded Npm-N in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl (blue).
Velocity sedimentation AUC analysis shows the folded state to be pentameric and the disordered state to be monomeric.
Analysis using sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) confirmed that the high-salt form of Npm-N was pentameric (Fig. 2D, blue trace, and SI Appendix, Table S3) and that the disordered, low-salt form was an elongated monomer (Fig. 2D, red trace, and SI Appendix, Table S3).
Thr95 and Ser125 were chosen as examples of solvent exposed phosphosites. Thr95 lies at the tip of the loop connecting β6′ and β7, whereas Ser125 is located within the disordered C-terminal acidic tract, A2 (Figs. 2B and and3D).
Conversely, residues from the flexible linker (amino acids 267–336) are poorly dispersed in the proton dimension, ranging from 8.06 ppm (A318) to 8.61 ppm (S334).
The disordered linker is not, however, a statistical random-coil over its entire length. The temperature-dependent attenuation of 1H–15N HSQC peak intensities is particularly pronounced for residues 279–287. This correlates with observed chemical shift deviations from random coil values, as well as the predicted helical propensity of the sequence (not shown).
The phosphoprotein is the non-catalytic subunit of the polymerase, and its C-terminal region enables the polymerase to engage with the nucleocapsid. Here, we report the 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shift assignments of the C-terminal region (amino acids 267-388) of the Menangle virus phosphoprotein. This region has a bipartite character, with a highly flexible and structurally disordered sequence preceding a structured nucleocapsid-binding domain.
Conversely, residues from the flexible linker (amino acids 267–336) are poorly dispersed in the proton dimension, ranging from 8.06 ppm (A318) to 8.61 ppm (S334).
the Kratky plot for the isolated linker (L) increases monotonically with the scattering angle, which is characteristic of unfolded proteins
Although the analytic expression describing the scattering of the worm-like chain (Equation 6) involves approximations which are strictly valid only for long chains (L/b > 10), and at low scattering angles (qb < 3) [53,54], the model fits the data very well over the q range 0.015–0.30 Å−1 (Figure 5). The SAXS analysis therefore confirms that the linker has an extended conformation with no significantly populated tertiary structure.
In Menangle virus, the ~62 residue linker is also globally disordered and lacks any tertiary structure. This is readily apparent from model-free analysis of the SAXS data (Figure 4).
We investigate the oligomerization state of the MenV P protein in solution, as well as the structural characteristics of the flexible linker that connects the coiled-coil and the C-terminal binding domain.
The Kratky plot (Figure 4) for the entire C-terminal region (CC-L-BD) has a bell-shaped appearance, consistent with the major scattering contribution coming from the two structured domains (CC and BD) positioned at either end of the chain. In contrast, the Kratky plot for the isolated linker (L) increases monotonically with the scattering angle, which is characteristic of unfolded proteins [76]. The Kratky plot for L-BD has a hybrid appearance, reflecting its nearly equal partition between structured and unstructured regions. 
We found that a cloud of peaks was present around the center of the spectrum (~ 8 ppm along the 1H axis). Although a small number of exceptional peaks appeared separately from the others, most overlapped with each other as the result of severe line broadening.
These observations suggest that the N-terminal fragment Cdc37(1–144) did not adopt a single rigid conformation under neutral conditions, but that it was in dynamic equilibrium between several different structures, probably between an α-helical and random coil-like structure.
Because the ellipticity value of the CD spectrum is temporally and spatially averaged, its intensity directly depends on the stability or lifetime of α-helical conformations. That is, smaller CD signals could be recorded when the α-helical conformation adopted by each residue was not very stable, but transiently disappeared during measurement of the spectrum. In other words, the secondary and tertiary structures of the protein are not fixed to a single α-helical conformation, but change dynamically between two or more different conformational states.
This is partly supported by the near-UV CD spectra. Although the spectra indicate that the protein has a certain degree of tertiary structure (well-ordered packing of sidechain of aromatic amino acids) under the neutral conditions, the signal is very weak.
These physiological functions are considered to depend on phosphorylation at conserved Ser13 by protein kinase CK2α. To assess whether such chemical modification at the sidechain of aminoacids affects the conformational states of Cdc37, we attempted to prepare phosphorylated Cdc37(1–93) by incubating with CK2α. We first examined whether a phosphorylation reaction occurred in this small N-terminal fragment protein using Phos-tag SDS-PAGE, in which Phos-tag acrylamide gel specifically chelates phosphorylated residues in a protein and retards its migration during electrophoresis. The results clearly demonstrated that the smaller fragment Cdc37(1–93) was indeed phosphorylated by CK2α.
We used circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy to show that, unlike the structured TasA, TapA is disordered. In addition, TapA is composed of two weakly interacting domains: a disordered C-terminal domain and a more structured N-terminal domain.
The CD spectrum of a recombinant TapA (expressed in
E. coli, see the Supporting Information for more details)
showed that TapA was partially disordered, according to the
minimum at about 200 nm that was typical for disordered proteins (Figure 1 B).
The secondary structures of the polypeptides were then
determined by means of CD spectroscopy. The CD spectra of
FL TapA and the CTD and NTD fragments (Figure 2 B) show
that, similarly to the FL protein, the CTD and NTD were disordered, but to different extents.
The earlier elution of TapA in SEC, relative to a globular protein with the same mass, is expected for disordered proteins due to their extended hydrodynamic radius.
CD analysis, together with the analytical SEC and SEC-MALS results, indicated that TapA was a partially disordered monomer.
Thermal stability was determined for partially disordered FL
TapA and its CTD and NTD. Figure 3 A–C shows the CD spectra
of the FL, NTD, and CTD, respectively, upon gradual temperature increase. These plots surprisingly showed that TapA and its two domains were not melted with increasing temperature, but rather that they gained some a-helical structure (see Table S2 and Figure S5 for secondary-structure analysis). This thermodynamic signature is often an indication that folding under heating is entropically driven, and can be explained by the release of water molecules upon partial folding events.
In contrast to the semi-sigmoidal curve measured for the FL protein and the NTD fragment, the CTD melting curve decreased monotonically, which suggested that despite the clear existence of two states, the denatured-to-folded process was not cooperative.[27] Similar melting behavior has been previously observed for a variety of disordered proteins.
We used circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy to show that, unlike the structured TasA, TapA is disordered. In addition, TapA is composed of two weakly interacting domains: a disordered C-terminal domain and a more structured N-terminal domain. 
The structure of TapA, studied herein by using circular dichroism (CD) and solution NMR spectroscopy, showed that it was partially disordered and composed of two domains: a 63- residue C-terminal domain (CTD) and a 158-residue N-terminal domain (NTD).
The 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectrum of the 15N-enriched CTD fragment (Figure 5, left-hand
side, and the full spectrum in Figure S9) was typical for disordered proteins,[29] as indicated by the narrow chemical shift
dispersion (Dd1H =0.56 ppm), and in agreement with the CD
spectrum of the fragment (showing &70% disorder, excluding
turns).

We show that the solution NMR ensemble structure of the protein exchanges between multiple conformers, containing an unfolded Npro segment (residues 1–11) and a mostly helical IAPP region (residues 12–48).
There is a 22 residues long signal peptide in the UniProt sequence, therefore residue 1 of the propeptide corrsponds to residue 23 of the UniProt sequence.
The N‐terminal propeptide segment (T1‐R11) is unfolded in DPC micelles, with average S2 values below 0.4.
There is a 22 residues long signal peptide in the UniProt sequence, therefore residue 1 of the propeptide corrsponds to residue 23 of the UniProt sequence.
A disordered loop from S40‐G49 connects the C terminus of immature IAPP with the C‐terminal propeptide segment of N52‐L67, which appears fairly rigid.
The unstructured loop (S40‐K50) that tethers IAPP to Cpro is highly accessible to solvent.
In the absence of lipid, unfolded features dominate the CD spectra for proIAPP, and the protein is intrinsically disordered.
In the absence of lipid, unfolded features dominate the CD spectra for proIAPP, and the protein is intrinsically disordered. In the presence of detergent micelles and bicelles, the protein adopts a mostly α‐helical structure at both pH values. The helical structure is indicated by the mean residue ellipticity ([θ]) minima near 208 and 222 nm (Fig. 7A,B).
In the presence of membranes at pH 4.5, the proIAPP helicity is 47 ± 4%, 46 ± 5%, 50 ± 5%, and 31 ± 5% for DPC, SDS, 3 : 1 1,2‐dimyristoyl‐sn‐glycero‐3‐phosphocholine (DMPC)/1,2‐dimyristoyl‐sn‐glycero‐3‐phospho‐l‐serine (DMPS) bicelles, and DMPC bicelles, respectively. At pH 7.0, proIAPP helicity is 42 ± 4%, 50 ± 4%, 47 ± 5%, and 34 ± 5% for DPC, SDS, DMPC/DMPS bicelles, and DMPC bicelles respectively. The helical content of the protein in the absence of lipid is 14 ± 3% and 14 ± 3% at pH 4.5 at pH 7.0, respectively, which agrees with a previous report on the transiently helical α1 in IAPP and the presence of the C2‐C7 (C13‐C18 in proIAPP) disulfide bond [57].
In the absence of lipid, unfolded features dominate the CD spectra for proIAPP, and the protein is intrinsically disordered. In the presence of detergent micelles and bicelles, the protein adopts a mostly α‐helical structure at both pH values.

We used CD to conduct a secondary structure analysis of the Cpro peptide at pH 4.5 and 6.1, in the presence and absence of DPC micelles (Fig. 10A). In the absence of lipid, Cpro displays unfolded or coil characteristics at both pH values.
We used CD to conduct a secondary structure analysis of the Cpro peptide at pH 4.5 and 6.1, in the presence and absence of DPC micelles (Fig. 10A). In the absence of lipid, Cpro displays unfolded or coil characteristics at both pH values. At pH 4.5 in DPC micelles, Cpro appears predominantly helical.

In the absence of lipid, Cpro displays unfolded or coil characteristics at both pH values. At pH 4.5 in DPC micelles, Cpro appears predominantly helical.
The entire proIAPP structure appears to wrap around the DPC micelle.
SRCD measurements of QKI6 produced a spectrum typical for a folded protein, but the minimum at 205 nm suggested the presence of disorder (Fig. 2a).
The SRCD measurement itself could not indicate the position of the disordered residues, however, for the folded part there is available structure, so it is most likely the C-terminal tail that was responsible for the presence of disoder.
The dimeric QKI6 was highly flexible, as evident from the Kratky plot (Fig. 2c), and elongated, based on its radius of gyration (Rg, 5.24 nm) and maximum dimension (Dmax, 21 nm). Ab initio models based on the SAXS data appear elongated with a compact core (Fig. 2e).
In all three modelling sets, the 115 C-terminal residues were extended, in agreement with secondary structure predictions. To conclude, in the absence of an mRNA binding partner, the subdomains of dimeric QKI6 present a great degree of flexibility with respect to each other and most likely collapse to a more ordered arrangement upon binding to a 3′-UTR. The STAR domain is followed by an intrinsically disordered C terminus of currently unknown function.
As a first approach to identify the inhibitory domain of the ζ subunit, the recombinant protein was subjected to limited proteolysis with trypsin, which removed 14 and 25 residues from the N- and C-terminal extremes, respectively, as found by tandem mass spectrometry analyses.
The proteolytic accessibility of the N and C termini indicates that both extremes of the protein are exposed and most likely highly mobile, whereas the central Pd-ζ15–79 domain seems resistant to the protease treatment, suggesting that it should have a rigid folded structure that competes with Pd-ζWT for binding to the PdF1-ATPase.

The recombinant Pd-ζΔNT construct was overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described for the Pd-ζWT to ~93% purity. The Pd-ζΔNT was reconstituted into the PdF1-ATPase, and the inhibitory activity was measured. As shown in Fig. 3, removal of the first 14 N-terminal residues of Pd-ζ in the Pd-ζΔNT construct completely abolished the inhibitory capacity of the protein at concentrations as high as 9 μM, i.e., concentrations that result in saturation of the Pd-ζWT and completely block PdF1-ATPase activity. These data indicate that the N-terminal side of the Pd-ζ subunit contains the inhibitory domain of the protein.
The inhibitor is bound to the F1 domain via residues 1–19 of the N-terminal α-helix, which occupy a cleft in the lower region of the αDPβDP-catalytic interface, with the rest of the α-helix (residues 20–32) extending from the surface of the enzyme. 
In solution, residues 1–18 of the 107-aa chain of the ζ-inhibitor are unstructured, with the rest of the chain folded into a four-helix bundle (residues 19–42, 46–53, 66–77, and 81–103).
The inhibitor is bound to the F1 domain via residues 1–19 of the N-terminal α-helix, which occupy a cleft in the lower region of the αDPβDP-catalytic interface (Fig. 2 A and B), with the rest of the α-helix (residues 20–32) extending from the surface of the enzyme.
The flexibly disordered N-terminal 19-residue segment of Pd-ζ is not shown.
Here, we investigate the conformational behavior of the δ subunit of RNA polymerase from Bacillus subtilis whose unfolded domain is highly charged, with 7 positively charged amino acids followed by 51 acidic amino acids. Using a specifically designed analytical strategy, we identify transient contacts between the two regions using a combination of NMR paramagnetic relaxation enhancements, residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), chemical shifts, and small-angle scattering.
The unstructured C-terminal domain is 90 aa long and highly charged. The charge distribution of this domain is distinct, with a conserved stretch of 9 residues (96–104) containing 7 positive charges followed by the rest of the domain with 51 acidic residues (K-D/E motif).
Here, the ASTEROIDS approach(11−13) is used to describe the conformational behavior of the CTD of δ subunit in solution using a combination of NMR chemical shifts (CSs), paramagnetic relaxation enhancements (PREs), and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) as well as small-angle scattering (SAXS).
All the RDC-s, PRE-s and all depicted values in Figure 1 clearly support that the C-terminal segment is and IDR.
The most striking local feature was the deviation of Cα and C′ chemical shifts with respect to random coil values. Both shifts display negative average values as compared to secondary shifts, which translates into a tendency of the whole C-teminal domain toward an extended structure of the polyproline II type (PPII) and depletion of α helical conformations. This may be related to the high density of negative charges; indeed higher PPII conformation is detected in the acidic C-terminal part of the unfolded domain due to local electrostatic repulsion.

The Kratky plot depicted in Figure 1 as well as the normalized distribution of radius of gyrations of the selected ensembles compared to the statistical coil is typical for IDRs.
The most visible feature of the distance map are contacts observed between the lysine-rich stretch (K-tract, K96–K104) and the acidic region (F115–E170).

The 1HN chemical shift dispersion of the disordered C-terminal domain of the δ subunit is lower than that of the retroviral protease: 0.5 ppm versus 0.7 ppm. The 15N chemical shifts of the unstructured regions cover 6.4 and 11.1 ppm for the δ subunit and retroviral protease, respectively, with the most crowded regions spanning 3.4 ppm and 4.8 ppm, respectively.
The HSQC spectrum is typically that of a highly disordered protein. The authors provide the boundaries of the disordered C-terminus in Figure 1.
Experiments addressing the effect of the charge perturbation in δKE on the affinity of RNAP to DNA (Pilv promoter on a supercoiled plasmid) showed that δKE decreased the affinity of RNAP to DNA in comparison with RNAP with δ (Figure 5a). Experiments testing the effect of δ/δKE on the [iNTP] requirement (Pilv promoter on supercoiled plasmid) revealed that δ increased the requirement of RNAP for [GTP] in comparison to RNAP lacking δ, and this effect was more pronounced with δKE (Figure 5b).
Overall, 97% of the backbone resonances for residues 20 to 325 were assigned. The missing resonances are from seven Pro (P22, P93, P170, P180, P185, P214, P257) and one Arg (R285). None of the 15N and 13C signals from the mobile N-and C-termini (residues 1-19 and 326-350) could be detected in the spectra, consistent with our observation of these signals in solid-state NMR experiments designed to detect only signals from mobile sites (Supplementary Fig. 6), as well as our previous analysis of local and global motions of CXCR124.

The CXCR1 N-domain is unstructured in the free state but structured with significant dynamics in the bound state.
The relaxation data for the bound state indicate that the CXCR1 N-domain is structured, with distinct differences in dynamic properties at a residue-specific level (Figure 11).
In the unbound state, negative hetNOEs for all residues indicate that the CXCR1 N-domain is unstructured (Figure 10).
Chemical shifts are also characteristic of an unstructured peptide.
The chemical shift perturbation profile of the CXCL8 (1–66) monomer upon CXCR1 N-domain 29mer binding is shown in Figure 2.
Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measures binding-induced heat changes from which free energy of binding (∆G), enthalpy (∆H), entropy (∆S), and stoichiometry (n) can be obtained in a straightforward manner [60]. The binding isotherm of the CXCR1 N-domain binding to the CXCL8 monomer is shown in Figure 12. The data fit best to a single-binding site model, yielding a stoichiometry of 0.93 ± 0.03, KD = 8.4 ± 0.5 μM, ΔH = −2.6 ± 0.2 kcal/mol, and T∆S = −4.3 ± 0.2 kcal/mol, indicating both enthalpic and entropic factors promote binding.
In contrast, in the case of the L1 domain there are ~90 residues that are disordered (and thus that are not seen) in the apo form and that become ordered when the enzyme has the ligands bound to it (Fig. 1c, top panels).
Region 562-623 is disordered in the crystal structure of the apo form (PDB:5dot) and becomes ordered upon ligand binding (PDB:5dou).
Residues D779,F781,H782,T784 coordinate the binding of the potassium ion.
Residue S790 coordinates the binding of ADP.
Residues M585,R587,L592,G593,G594,G623 coordinate the binding of ADP.

Even if it is not mentioned in the paper, the 690-722 region was missing from the electron density.
Within each monomer, electron density map for most of our protein model was well defined, yet as with the crystal structure of pY705 STAT3 (PDB ID: 1BG1)[3], several residues, including loops within the SH2 domain, were poorly defined and consequently were not included in the final model; i.e., the loop connecting α-helices 1 and 2 (185–193), residues 419–427 between β-sheets e and f, a loop at the end of α-helix 7 (536–538), and several residues within the SH2 domain (626–632, 658–665, 689–702; all numbers refer to monomer A).
Arg35 is the first residue in a disordered region of the molecule that extends through residue 56.
There were three regions of the structure for which there was no corresponding electron density. These missing regions consisted of residues 35–55, 313–318, and the last 15 residues at the C terminus of the
enzyme.

enzyme.
Due to a lack of defined density presumably caused by high mobility, some parts of the protein could not be modeled. These comprise residues 1-45, 72-75, 148-152, 266-278, and 375-376 of subunit A and residues 1-45, 148-152, 221-223, 266-273, and 375-376 of subunit B.
 In the case of chymotrypsin, however, two proteolysis-resistant, stable fragments are obtained ​(Fig.4). By mass spectrometric analysis and N-terminal sequencing, these fragments can be identified as the N-terminal residues 57 to 200 and the C-terminal residues 201 to 491 from αPAK, which we call the RD and CD, respectively ​(Fig.1).

To find the basis for the large difference in affinity between the isolated RD and the full-length protein or the RD-CD complex, we measured the kinetics of interaction between PAK and Cdc42 by stopped-flow analysis. Figure ​Figure7A shows that the association between the isolated RD and Cdc42-mGppNHp is fast.
Resonances corresponding to residues 195-198 had
larger line widths than the rest of the peptide. These residues
are likely to be undergoing conformational exchange on a
millisecond to microsecond time scale
We have determined
the structure of the PIX-SH3/PAK peptide complex and shown that it differs from typical Src-like SH3/
peptide complexes
 PAK recruitment  to  Cdc42-and  Rac1-driven FCs requires  its  interaction with  PIX through a motif  encompassing residues alphaPAK 182–203, a region implicated as a focal adhesion targeting signal(Manser et al., 1997)
We further show that Cdc42 binding is required, but not sufficient, to direct PAKs to cell–cell contacts and that an N-terminal polybasic sequence is necessary for PAK1 recruitment to cell–cell contacts, but only if the variable region–mediated inhibition is released
Whereas GFP-PAK(1–107) targets robustly to cell–cell contacts, when the lysines are mutated to alanines, targeting is abolished (Fig. 6, E, H, and I), supporting the importance of the polybasic region for targeting
The 2.3 Å resolution crystal structure of a complex between the N-terminal autoregulatory fragment and the C-terminal kinase domain of PAK1 shows that GTPase binding will trigger a series of conformational changes
Efforts to prepare the PAK1(70–149) fragment in the absence of the kinase domain yield a poorly behaved protein with a strong tendency to aggregate. The IS domain on its own may be largely unfolded, requiring an interface with the kinase domain for stability.
The autoregulatory fragment (residues 79–149) and the kinase domain (residues 249–545) of human PAK1 were cloned into the GST-fusion vector pGEX2N
Moreover, as documented for the WASP PBD/IS region and suggested by the instability in solution of PAK1(70–149), the contingently folded segment may be fully disordered in the absence of interaction with other protein elements.
Highest affinity binding (Kd approximately 0.05 microM) was seen with longer fragments ending at residue 118 or 132. A small increase in affinity was seen with those fragments starting at residue 70 rather than residue 75.
Calorimetric measurements revealed that binding was associated with a relatively slow heat change. It is suggested that these PAK fragments (in the absence of Cdc42 or Rac) might exist predominantly in an inactive conformation that slowly interconverts with an active conformation and/or a slow conformational change may occur upon binding to Cdc42/Rac.
PAK70-94 and PAK75-94 showed only very weak binding to either Cdc42 or Rac (Kd = 40−100 μM), confirming that the CRIB motif alone is insufficient for high-affinity binding.
In contrast to other small G protein effectors such as Raf, RalGDS, RasGAP, and RhoGAP, the Cdc42/Rac-interacting domain of PAK may not be fully structured in the absence of the small G protein.
The core of the dimer interaction is an antiparallel β ribbon, formed by residues 80–87 from each of the two monomers (Figure 3A). Seven main chain hydrogen bonds link the two segments, and there are salt bridges between Glu82 on one strand and His86 on the other.
As summarized in Figure 5, experiments using calibrated size exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering, and analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrate that PAK1(70–149 + 249–545) and PAK1(70–545) are assemblies of about 85 kDa and 106 kDa, respectively, as expected if the crystallographic interaction is present in these species
The hydrodynamic radius of the PAK1(70–545) dimer is significantly larger than that of the four-chain complex, probably because residues 150–248 are in an extended, flexible loop with measurable frictional drag.
We present biochemical evidence that an autoinhibitory domain (ID) contained within amino acid residues 67–150 of Pak1 interacts with the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain and that this interaction is regulated in a GTPase-dependent fashion.
The purified hpak1-(67–150) fragments had different abilities to inhibit GST-rpak1-(233–544) kinase (Fig. 2 B). The wild type hpak1-(67–150) was most potent in inhibiting kinase activity, whereas the L107F mutated peptide was strongly reduced in its inhibitory potency, and the H83L,H86L double mutant was moderately reduced in inhibiting GST-rpak1-(233–544) kinase activity.
We termed the hpak1-(67–150) region PBD/ID (p21 bindingdomain/inhibitory domain).
We expressed and purified residues 83–137 of PAK1 (WT_IS), which in the crystal structure of autoinhibited PAK1 interact with the C lobe of PAK1 kinase domain and form a small folded domain with three helices and a β-strand (Fig. 1). The circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of the purified IS domain showed that the domain does not fold in isolation (Fig. 2).
Not surprisingly, the domain was prone to aggregation and proteolysis during expression and purification.
Whereas GFP-PAK(1–107) targets robustly to cell–cell contacts, when the lysines are mutated to alanines, targeting is abolished (Fig. 6, E, H, and I), supporting the importance of the polybasic region for targeting.
As summarized in Figure 5, experiments using calibrated size exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering, and analytical ultracentrifugation demonstrate that PAK1(70–149 + 249–545) and PAK1(70–545) are assemblies of about 85 kDa and 106 kDa, respectively, as expected if the crystallographic interaction is present in these species.

The N-terminal region (1-217) is missing even if not mentioned in the article.
On the other hand, our CD data show that the CXCR1 N-domain is unstructured in the free form, and relatively more structured in the bound form (Fig. 5). The N-domain peptide in the free form shows a minimum at 199 nm, which is characteristic of random coil structure, and on binding, the minimum is shifted to ≈ 203 nm and also shows a new peak at ≈ 220 nm.

The ellipticity of a sample of L5, measured at 222 nm as a function of temperature, exhibits a modestly cooperative transition (Figure 3(A)). This type of behavior has been observed with other RNA-binding proteins and taken as evidence that the protein is poorly structured or contains intrinsically disordered regions.29., 30.
These spectroscopic data establish that L5 is intrinsically unstructured to some degree and binding of 5 S rRNA induces folding of the protein.
There is a considerable change in the melting profile of L5 upon addition of a stoichiometric amount of 5 S rRNA. L5 now exhibits a more cooperative transition that is indicative of a more structured protein.

These spectroscopic data establish that L5 is intrinsically unstructured to some degree and binding of 5 S rRNA induces folding of the protein.
Strikingly, the number of exchangeable protons in L5 increases very little in the presence of urea, indicating that a considerable amount of the protein is intrinsically unstructured in the native state and/or is highly dynamic.
These results not only provide further evidence that L5 is poorly structured in the absence of 5 S rRNA, but that this intrinsic disorder extends over a considerable amount of the protein.
The extreme sensitivity of L5 to protease relative to MBP is additional evidence that the former is largely unstructured.
In our current model, the αN helix of GRK1 is intrinsically disordered until it binds to activated GPCRs in a form of ‘molecular fly-casting’48 (Fig. 5).
Primary structure of C-terminally truncated bovine GRK1 (residues 1–535) used in this study and its crystal structure in complex with ATP (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 3C4W49), wherein the N terminus is disordered and the AST loop is partially ordered.
In our current model, the αN helix of GRK1 is intrinsically disordered until it binds to activated GPCRs in a form of ‘molecular fly-casting’48 (Fig. 5).
The zone of missing residues 481–496 is on the exterior of the domain, in a position where a helix would be expected in order to complete the second α+β plait motif.
The regulatory domain is at the top in magenta and orange. The missing zone (residues 481–496) is indicated by a dotted line. (Secondary structure assignments were made using the program DSSP [24].)
The black spheres show the start and end of the missing zone (residues 481–496) in TD the structure of which may be similar to the rightmost PGD helix.
 The final model lacks residues 1–4 at the N terminus and also lacks residues 481–496. This missing zone in the regulatory domain corresponds to a highly exposed connection between two β strands, where electron-density maps show the presence of the polypeptide but are insufficiently ordered to construct it. The distance between residues 480 and 497 and the extent of the intervening weak density correspond reasonably well with
the number of missing residues, and there is no ambiguity about the topology or fold
Residues 66–84 appear to be unstructured, indicated by decreased heteronuclear 1H-15N-NOE values (Figure 3) and the lack of experimental NOE-derived structural data for this part of the protein.
Both 15N T2 and steady-state 1H-15N NOE values support the hypothesis of an unstructured carboxy-terminal region encompassing residues 66–84 in contrast to the well-folded b-sandwich comprising residues 1–65.
To  understand  how  H3K4me3  binding  enhances  demethylase activity, we determined the cocrystal structure of PHF81–447 with an H31–24 peptide containing H3K4me3 and H3K9me2 (Fig. 1e) in the presence of Fe2+ and N-oxalylglycine (the cofactor analog) to form a  catalytically  inert  complex  (Table  1).  The  structure,  determined at a resolution of 2.2 Å, shows that the PHD and jumonji domains act in concert in substrate recognition. The first 11 residues of the H3  peptide  were  nearly  buried  in  a  deep  cleft  between  the  PHD and the jumonji domains with a disordered linker (residues 66–78)  (Fig. 1e).
The IDR characterized in the publication and spanning residues 66-78 corresponds residues 102-114 of the canonical sequence in UniProt, since the authors determined a structure of PHF8 without the first 36 aminoacids. 
The first 11 residues of the H3 peptide were nearly buried in a deep cleft between the PHD and the jumonji domains with a disordered linker (residues 66–78) (Fig. 1e).
As the MS analysis for the recombinant protein gives the expected mass value (Mr = 38 495 ± 4; predicted mass of Mr = 38 493) for the amino-acid residues 19−259 construct, residues 19−29 are present but are not seen
in the electron density due to disorder (as is also predicted by the DisEMBL server (http://dis.embl.de/).
We noted that the stretch of amino acids 19−29 in the MltC structure is
disordered. 
It is tempting to speculate that the disorder within the residues 19−29 would impart the ability for a rotational motion to MltC to sweep out a large annulus of cleared peptidoglycan per each molecule of enzyme (Figure
4B), which would enable insertion of a large assembly such as that of the flagellum.
(B) Rotational motion of a single membrane bound MltC with its disordered linker (residues 19−29, depicted in light brown) could create a large annulus of cleared peptidoglycan.
The N-terminus, the site of attachment of residues 19−29 and the fatty acyl membrane anchor, which is not seen in the electron density, is indicated by an arrow at 11 o’clock.
Notably, we also made truncations deleting the kinase domain and variable regions of PAK2 and PAK3, and, similar to what we observed for PAK1, whereas full-length PAK2 and PAK3 do not target to junctions, GFP-PAK2(1–108) and GFP-PAK3(1–109) target very well (Fig. 3D).
Nonetheless, these constructs support the conclusion that the N-terminal and CRIB domain regions of type I PAKs can target to cell–cell boundaries, and the variable region inhibits targeting.
Interaction of PAK2(71−92) with sNBD-labeled Cdc42 (21) was followed by changes in extrinsic fluorescence with the addition of varying amounts of the peptide (0−2.5 μM).
The increment in fluorescence is plotted, and the line represents a fit of the data to a simple model for bimolecular association.
Proton NMR studies of PAK2(71−92) demonstrate structuring of PAK2(71−92) in the presence of GTP-γS-loaded Cdc42, through the observation of many nonsequential transferred NOEs. Structure calculations based on the observed transferred NOEs show that the central portion of the Cdc42-bound CRIB peptide assumes a loop conformation in which the side chains of consensus residues Phe80, His82, Ile84, His85, and Val86 are brought into proximity.

 Interestingly, interaction of PAK2(71−92) with GTP-γS-loaded Cdc42 leads to structuring of this peptide, as evidenced by the appearance of many transferred NOEs. Similar NOEs are not observed in the free peptide, and are significantly attenuated in the presence of GDP-bound Cdc42. Although the structure of the entire peptide is not well defined, residues Pro77−Ala90 fold into a unique conformation upon binding to the “active” form of Cdc42. Structure calculations revealed a loop conformation condensed around a hydrophobic cluster comprised of residues Phe80, His82, Ile84, His85, and Val86.
The EspG-binding site on PAK2 was defined to residues 121–136, a highly conserved sequence that encodes the Iα3-helix within the kinase AID (Supplementary Fig. 8). We crystallized EspG in complex with the PAK2 Iα3-helix fragment and solved the structure to a resolution of 2.8 Å (Supplementary Table 1). EspG recognized the initial turn of the Iα3-helix whereas the remainder of the peptide adopted an extended strand conformation that lies orthogonal to the EspG six-stranded β-sheet (Fig. 3a, b).

The asymmetric unit contains four copies of HDAC4, each of which folds into a single α-helix from residues 62–129, whereas residues 130–153 are disordered (Fig. 1).
Because the X-shaped diffusive streaks have a cross-angle similar to that of the four-helix bundle, one possibility is that the disordered region between residues 130 and 153 are trapped in the crystal lattice approximately along the same direction of the ordered region (residues 62 to 129) but are rotationally disordered.
In addition, it was observed that amino acids 729 to 760 were not visible in the electron density maps for any of the three molecules in the asymmetric unit and were omitted
from the model because of disorder.
The 1H/15N heteronuclear NOE data also shows that residues 2–7, before the start of the N-terminal helix, and residues 61–75 following the end of the C-terminal helix exhibit gradients of increasing motion towards the termini, although even the terminal residues do not appear to be highly mobile and unstructured, as is sometimes the case in this class of proteins [32,50].
Residues COOH-terminal to the bromodomain motifs (residues 1625 to 1638) were not visible in the experimental map and presumably are disordered. 
There is a small protein density contacting the minor groove of the Inr (Fig. 2a, d). We propose that it corresponds to the portion of TAF1 between residues 993–1075, which is disordered in the crystal structure but is well conserved among metazoans and is predicted to be ~50% α-helical (Extended Data Fig. 4c–e).
The IDR chracterized in the publication and spanning residues 993-1075 of the isoform 2 corresponds to region 972-1053 of the canonical sequence, since the isoform 2 differs from the canonical sequence as follows 177-177: G → GVSENGEGIILPSIIAPSSLAS
In Nova KH1-KH2, the interdomain linker is considerably longer (26-aa)  and  partially  disordered  in  the  crystal,  compared  to  a  10-aa  linker  in  IMP1 KH3/4, and a 14-aa linker in PCBP2 KH1/2.
The N-terminal 96 residues of the construct used to obtain the crystals in this study were not visible in the final structure. As this region of the protein is predicted to have very little secondary structure (Kabsch, 1983), it was unclear whether the entire construct had been crystallized and simply contained a disordered N-terminus, or the N- terminal amino acids were actually absent.
Additionally, in a sample of purified spastin protein, several low molecular weight bands were detected, indicating that the N-terminus of this construct is degraded or cleaved.
The N-terminal region consists of four subdomains (see Fig. 1 A for schematic): the Atlastin binding domain (Evans et al., 2006), the MIT domain, alternatively spliced exon 4 (Charvin et al., 2003), and as we show in Fig. 2, an MTBD that is both necessary for MT severing and sufficient for MT association.
In contrast, ΔMTBD Spastin neither bound nor severed MTs, demonstrating that aa 270–328 are necessary for MT severing in vitro. 
In contrast, deletion of the first 328 amino acids did abolish severing activity,  as  the  transfected  cell  still  has  an  MT  array.  This  suggested  that  the approximate boundaries for a MTBD are between aa 280 and 328. 
We next examined whether the MTBD was sufficient to confer MT association both in cells and in vitro. In transfection experiments, 1–328 stop Spastin but not 1–279 stop Spastin 
decorated  MTs,  suggesting  that  amino  acids  280–328  are  important for MT binding (Fig. 2 C).
In addition to the pore interaction with tubulin, we defi ne an N-terminal MT binding domain (MTBD) in  Spastin  that  mediates  the  attachment  of  Spastin  to  the  MT.  
This interaction is also required for severing.
In contrast, ∆MTBD Spastin neither bound nor severed MTs, demonstrating that aa 270–328 are necessary for MT severing in vitro
In contrast, deletion of the first 328 amino acids did abolish severing activity,  as  the  transfected  cell  still  has  an  MT  array.
Our  deletion  analysis  revealed  the  existence  of  an  N-terminal MTBD in Spastin (aa 270–328) that is required for MT-severing activity in vivo and in vitro.
Similar to the result of a previous structural study of human spastin [30], only the AAA domain was visible in the electron density, while the MTBD region was not visible. 
A close inspection to the crystal structure of either wild-type μ4 (pdb entry 3l81; [18]) or μ4-D190A revealed that the SDQSQKNEVF sequence is at the end of the disordered N-terminal region, in which only the NEVF portion is visible in the crystal structure (Figure 6E)

Likewise, the SASPLGLGPA sequence is part of a disordered loop followed by a well-structured region, with the LGLGPA portion visible in the crystal structure (Figure 6E). 
Disordered loops are in green (P388-P399) and red (P430-N 435) letters in µ4 and
in green (V221-G237) and blue (K256-S259) letters in µ2, and are represented in the respective colors as dashed lines in (A).
The internal missing part, His95– Gln123, corresponds to the internal loop of the TthL16 NMR structure. 
The invisible electron density of His95–Gln123 implies that the internal loop of eukaryotic L10 is also flexible in the free state and assumes a structure by binding on the ribosome.
The internal disordered region (residues His95–Gln123) is indicated by arrows.
The internal loop of L10CD, Arg98–Gln123, was removed from the search model in advance because the loop was expected to be unstructured considering the NMR analysis of bacterial L16.
The entire mass spectrum of pepsin-digested Pak2 is shown in Fig. 3a. 30 of 42 identified peptides had m/z ratios that were sufficiently different from one another and of sufficient magnitude to use in the amide H/D exchange experiments discussed below. These peptides covered 50% of the primary sequence of Pak2, including all or part of the following regions: the N-terminal region, dimerization domain, AID, glycine-rich loop, C helix, catalytic loop, magnesium-positioning loop, activation loop, and regions without an identified function.

In addition, caspase cleavage and autophosphorylation dramatically and specifically increased deuteron incorporation into the N-terminal -5–17 fragment by about five deuterons, bringing the level of incorporation to 90% of the maximum, and indicating a region of high solvent exposure/flexibility (Table 1).

 The first N-terminal residue and 15 C-terminal residues comprising part of the inter-domain linker were not ordered in the electron density map.

The final model includes residues 207-800 of TAF5 (residues 194-206, 381-416 and 748-753 were not modeled due to poor definition), residues 6-92 of TAF6 and residues 5-120 of TAF9.

A Concerted Action of UBA5 C-Terminal Unstructured Regions Is Important for transfer of Activated UFM1 to UFC1
We explored the hypothesis that the unstructured C-terminal region of UBA5 serves as a regulatory region, controlling cellular localization of the elements of the ufmylation cascade and effective interaction between them. We found that the last 20 residues in UBA5 are pivotal for binding to UFC1 and can accelerate the transfer of UFM1 to UFC1. We solved the structure of a complex of UFC1 and a peptide spanning the last 20 residues of UBA5 by NMR spectroscopy. This structure in combination with additional NMR titration and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments revealed the mechanism of interaction and confirmed the importance of the C-terminal unstructured region in UBA5 for the ufmylation cascade.
The structures of UBA5 AD (brown), UFM1 (cyan) and UFC1 (grey)
are represented as ribbon diagrams; the UBA5 unstructured C-terminus containing regions R1 (orange), R2 (green) and R3
(violet) is shown as dashed lines. The structures were generated from PDB entry 5IAA [29].
Residues 394–404 of the R3 region form the predicted [32] α-helix, residues 384–392 are in an extended conformation, well-defined and occupy a specific area on the UFC1 surface. Residues 381–383 seem disordered and do not interact specifically with any UFC1 residues.

The affinity of UFM1 to the R1-containing peptides (R1-R2-R3 325–404 and R1-R2 325–376, Supplementary Figure S2B and Table 2) does not change significantly compared to the
affinity of the isolated R1 325 − 357 peptide [31], indicating that this interaction is completely located within the LIR/UFIM containing region.
While UFM1 seems to bind only to the LIR/UFIM region of UBA5, LC3/GABARAP proteins interact with additional residues outside of the of the R1 sequence.
In general, we were able to observe relatively stable interactions between members of the ufmylation cascade only for the R1:UFM1 and R3:UFC1 interactions.
In contrast, LC3/GABARAP proteins showed a 10-fold higher affinity to the R1-R2-R3 325–404 and R1-R2 325–376 peptides compared to the isolated LIR/UFIM motif (R1 337 − 348 ) characterized in [31,33]. The K D values for interactions between R1-R2-R3 325–404 and GABARAPL2 (0.17 µM) or LC3B (3.7 µM) indicate the same subfamily-specific preferences that were reported previously (Supplementary Figure S2C,D).
While UFM1 seems to bind only to the LIR/UFIM region of UBA5, LC3/GABARAP proteins interact with additional residues outside of the of the R1 sequence. LC3 and GABARAP subfamily proteins showed a 10-fold higher affinity to the complete UBA5 C-terminus compared to the isolated R1 peptide.
The GABARAP and LC3 subfamilies members were found to bind UBA5 via an atypical LIR (LIR/UFIM), an evolutionary conserved sequence within the UBA5 C-terminal part [31,33]. The ITC and NMR experiments revealed additional interactions next to the known binding site within the R1. UBA5 constructs including both R1 and R2 regions showed a 10fold higher binding affinity to all GABARAP and LC3 protein subfamily members.
In contrast, LC3/GABARAP proteins showed a 10-fold higher affinity to the R1-R2-R3 325–404 and R1-R2 325–376 peptides compared to the isolated LIR/UFIM motif (R1 337 − 348 ) characterized in [31,33].

UBA5 constructs including both R1 and R2 regions showed a 10fold higher binding affinity to all GABARAP and LC3 protein subfamily members.
The affinity of the interaction between UBA5 and UFC1 has not been characterized previously. In ITC experiments, the shortest UBA5 peptide spanning the R3 sequence (R3 388–404 ) bound to UFC1 with a K D of >11 µM. The affinity increased 3-fold for R2-R3 359–404 and R1-R2-R3 325–404 peptides (K D of 2.7 and 2.4 µM, respectively; Figure 2A and Table 2).
Taken together, we identified a UFC1-interacting region within the UBA5 C-terminus using ITC and NMR experiments. The region is slightly longer than the conserved R3 sequence which was detected previously and shows a micromolar affinity to UFC1.
Additionally, UFC1 showed interaction outside of the R3 region, binding residues within the R2 region. NMR titrations revealed that UFC1 and GABARAPL2 have a more complex binding mechanism to the UBA5 C-terminus, involving some residues in the R2 region. However, no direct interactions of all tested proteins to the isolated R2 peptide were observed.
Our ITC and NMR titration experiments revealed that the interaction between UFC1 and UBA5 is mediated mostly by the relatively short and evolutionary conserved stretch of UBA5 residues (383–404).
The complex structure in combination with the NMR and ITC titration experiments revealed that in addition to the core R3 region, residues in the region R2 contribute to the interaction. While the isolated R2 peptide does not interact with UFC1, the combination of R2 and R3 binds three times tighter than the R3 alone.
To understand the role of the UBA5 C-terminal region in coordination of the binding events reported above on the molecular level, we performed NMR titration experiments. In those experiments, we titrated non-labeled UFC1 and GABARAPL2 proteins to a 15 N-labeled R1-R2-R3 325–404 peptide. The NMR experiments revealed that the interaction between UFC1 and UBA5 is mediated mostly by the UBA5 residues 386–404. These residues (in contrast to the vast majority of the R1-R2-R3 325–404 resonances, which are not affected by addition of UFC1) showed a slow-to-intermediate exchange mode. The amide backbone resonances of these residues disappeared with small chemical shift perturbation (CSP) at the earlier stages of titrations and did not appear again up to an 8-fold molar excess of UFC1 (Figure 2B, the full size spectra are presented in Supplementary Figure S3D). UBA5 residues 383–386, 400 and 403 appeared to be in intermediate exchange mode (their amide backbone resonances displayed CSP with intensity change, however, they became visible at the latest titration steps). It seems, that these UBA5 residues form additional interactions with UFC1. Interestingly, a subset of the residues within the R2 region (V370, A371, Y372 and T373) displayed moderate CSPs, however, below standard deviation level (Figure 2C), possibly indicating an influence of the UBA5 A371T mutation on the recognition of UFC1.
Taken together, we identified a UFC1-interacting region within the UBA5 C-terminus using ITC and NMR experiments. The region is slightly longer than the conserved R3 sequence which was detected previously and shows a micromolar affinity to UFC1.
Additionally, UFC1 showed interaction outside of the R3 region, binding residues within the R2 region.

However, no direct interactions of all tested proteins to the isolated R2 peptide were observed.

While the isolated R2 peptide does not interact with UFC1, the combination of R2 and R3 binds three times tighter than the R3 alone.
In this study, we described and characterized a combined linear LC3-interacting region/UFM1-interacting motif (LIR/UFIM) within the C terminus of UBA5. This single motif ensures that UBA5 binds both UFM1 and light chain 3/γ-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated proteins (LC3/GABARAP), two ubiquitin (Ub)-like proteins. We demonstrated that LIR/UFIM is required for the full biological activity of UBA5 and for the effective transfer of UFM1 onto UFC1 and a downstream protein substrate both in vitro and in cells. Taken together, our study provides important structural and functional insights into the interaction between UBA5 and Ub-like modifiers, improving the understanding of the biology of the ufmylation pathway.
In the current study, we have identified a short linear motif in the C terminus of UBA5 that drives the interaction with either UFM1 or LC3/GABARAP proteins, defining this as a LIR/UFIM (for LC3-interacting region/UFM1-interacting motif). We present structural details for its interaction with UFM1 and model its interaction with GABARAPL2 and LC3B.
A key residue, Ile-343, of the LIR/UFIM occupies the hydrophobic pocket (somewhat similar to HP2 in LC3) formed by the residues of Leu-21, Val-23, Val-32, and Phe-35 of UFM1 (Fig. 4, B and C). Additionally, Trp-341 and Val-346 of UBA5 LIR/UFIM interact with Pro-28 and Val-20 of UFM1, respectively (Fig. 4B). Trp-341 does not intercalate into the hydrophobic core of UFM1 but covers a significant part of the nonpolar surface, playing an important role in the complex stabilization. Leu-345 completes the formation of the hydrophobic cluster within the complex by contacts to the hydrophobic side chains of UFM1 (Val-20, Leu-21, and Val-23) (Fig. 4B).
The region includes the non-canonical LIR motif "WGIELV".

We present structural details for its interaction with UFM1 and model its interaction with GABARAPL2 and LC3B. By combining biophysical, biochemical and cellular techniques, we have provided a detailed characterization of the new UBL-binding motif and generated evidence for its role in the ability of UBA5 to mediate UFM1 conjugation in vitro and in cells. Our data suggest that a single UBL-binding element within UBA5 is responsible for both its function as an E1 enzyme in the ufmylation pathway and the interaction with LC3/GABARAP proteins.
NMR titration experiments confirmed the ITC data for the UFM1-LIR/UFIM interaction. We observed a typical pattern for interaction of two polypeptides with a KD in the range of 10 μm (Fig. 2D). Chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) induced by titration of the nonlabeled LIR/UFIM peptide into 15N-labeled UFM1 were moderate and mostly in intermediate to slow exchange modes. In particular, CSPs of Val-20, Leu-21, Ser-22, Val-23, Ser-26, Ala-31, Val-32, Leu-33, Ala-36, Glu-39, and Ala-63 indicated strong participation of these residues in the intermolecular contacts. However, some resonances of the UFM1 residues show significant CSP in the fast exchange mode (e.g. Ser-2, Phe-6, Lys-7, Lys-19, Thr-30, Lys-34, Phe-35, Ala-37, and Phe-40) (Fig. 2D and data not shown).
The biggest CSPs are localized within the area composed of β-strand 2 and parts of α-helix 1 (residues 20–23 and 31–36), comprising a hydrophobic spot on the UFM1 surface. The UFM1 residues within long loop 1, connecting β-strands 1 and 2, remained mostly unassigned even after formation of the complex with the LIR/UFIM, in agreement with previous observations (34). However, a few assigned residues within loop 1 showed almost no CSPs, indicating a weak contribution of this element to the interaction.

In this study, we described and characterized a combined linear LC3-interacting region/UFM1-interacting motif (LIR/UFIM) within the C terminus of UBA5. This single motif ensures that UBA5 binds both UFM1 and light chain 3/γ-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated proteins (LC3/GABARAP), two ubiquitin (Ub)-like proteins. We demonstrated that LIR/UFIM is required for the full biological activity of UBA5 and for the effective transfer of UFM1 onto UFC1 and a downstream protein substrate both in vitro and in cells. Taken together, our study provides important structural and functional insights into the interaction between UBA5 and Ub-like modifiers, improving the understanding of the biology of the ufmylation pathway.
In the current study, we have identified a short linear motif in the C terminus of UBA5 that drives the interaction with either UFM1 or LC3/GABARAP proteins, defining this as a LIR/UFIM (for LC3-interacting region/UFM1-interacting motif). We present structural details for its interaction with UFM1 and model its interaction with GABARAPL2 and LC3B. By combining biophysical, biochemical and cellular techniques, we have provided a detailed characterization of the new UBL-binding motif and generated evidence for its role in the ability of UBA5 to mediate UFM1 conjugation in vitro and in cells. Our data suggest that a single UBL-binding element within UBA5 is responsible for both its function as an E1 enzyme in the ufmylation pathway and the interaction with LC3/GABARAP proteins.
NMR titration experiments confirmed the ITC data for the UFM1-LIR/UFIM interaction. We observed a typical pattern for interaction of two polypeptides with a KD in the range of 10 μm (Fig. 2D). Chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) induced by titration of the nonlabeled LIR/UFIM peptide into 15N-labeled UFM1 were moderate and mostly in intermediate to slow exchange modes. In particular, CSPs of Val-20, Leu-21, Ser-22, Val-23, Ser-26, Ala-31, Val-32, Leu-33, Ala-36, Glu-39, and Ala-63 indicated strong participation of these residues in the intermolecular contacts.

We then characterized the interaction between UBLs and a synthetic peptide spanning the human UBA5 LIR/UFIM sequence by biophysical methods. The ITC experiment using purified UFM1 protein and the LIR/UFIM peptide showed that the affinity of the UFM1-LIR/UFIM interaction (Fig. 2C, left plot, and Table 5) lies in the middle range (KD of 8 μm).
We also analyzed interactions between the LC3/GABARAP proteins and the LIR/UFIM peptide. According to the ITC data, all GABARAP-type proteins had a significant preference for LIR/UFIM binding (Fig. 3A and Table 5), with GABARAPL2 showing the highest affinity for LIR/UFIM (KD of 1.6 μm) followed by GABARAPL1 and GABARAP (with KD of 6 and 16 μm, respectively).

An atypical LIR motif within UBA5 (ubiquitin like modifier activating enzyme 5) interacts with GABARAP proteins and mediates membrane localization of UBA5
Structural analysis of GABARAP proteins in complex with the UBA5 LIR peptide reveals a new molecular mechanism of Atg8:LIR interactions
We previously showed that UBA5 has an unusual LIR motif consisting of the core sequence EWGIELVSE, which predominantly interacts with GABARAP proteins [24] and does not align with other known LIR motifs [3]. To understand the molecular mechanism of this interaction, we solved the NMR solution structure of GABARAPL2 in complex with a peptide spanning residues 333–348 of UBA5 (Figure 1(a).).

An atypical LIR motif within UBA5 (ubiquitin like modifier activating enzyme 5) interacts with GABARAP proteins and mediates membrane localization of UBA5
To analyze the importance of each hydrophobic residue within the core UBA5 LIR motif for the binding to GABARAP proteins, we performed peptide arrays, in which we mutated residues W341, I343, L345 and V346 of UBA5 to other hydrophobic amino acids (W, F, Y, I, L, V, M and A). In agreement with our structural analysis, mutations of I343 and L345, which occupy HP1, as well as V346, which occupies HP2, results in a moderate decrease in binding affinity of up to 30% (Figure 1(d)). Thus, these UBA5 LIR residues do not form the critical specific contacts to GABARAPs and could be substituted by any hydrophobic residues without drastic effects. In contrast, W341 appears to be crucial for binding: only aromatic amino acids are tolerated at this position and mutations to any other aliphatic residue abrogated the interaction almost completely (Figure 1(d)). This is in line with our previous results [24], where mutating W341 to alanine (W341A) resulted in a loss of binding of the full-length UBA5 to GABARAPs in pull-down experiments, while the mutations I343A, L345A and V346A only partially reduced the interaction.

An atypical LIR motif within UBA5 (ubiquitin like modifier activating enzyme 5) interacts with GABARAP proteins and mediates membrane localization of UBA5
The interaction between UBA5 and GABARAP proteins is crucial for UBA5 localization to ER membranes
Taken together, we could show that GABARAP proteins regulates the cellular localization of UBA5 by recruiting it to ER membranes and thus serves as a recruitment factor for UBA5. Consequently, this UBA5 localization predetermined the functional activity of the UFL1/UFBP1 E3 complexes within the ER, highlighting the role of GABARAPs as a signaling scaffold in the ufmylation pathway.

Structural and Functional Analysis of a Novel Interaction Motif within UFM1-activating Enzyme 5 (UBA5) Required for Binding to Ubiquitin-like Proteins and Ufmylation.
Formation of UFM1 conjugates depends on intact LIR/UFIM within UBA5.
Finally, we tested whether conjugation of UFM1 to target proteins in the cell depended on the intact LIR/UFIM in UBA5. We made use of the cellular ufmylation assay in which FLAG-tagged wild-type and LIR/UFIM mutant forms of UBA5 are co-expressed with the C-terminal glycine-exposed form of FLAG-UFM1 as well as Myc-UFL1 and Myc-UFBP1 (the latter serves as a substrate for ufmylation) in HEK293 cells in which UBA5 was deleted by CRISPR/Cas9 technology (4). UFBP1 is an E3 adaptor protein, dependent on its Lys-267 ufmylation (3); therefore, we used wild-type UFBP1 and its K267R mutant form as a negative control in this experiment. Upon overexpression of wild-type FLAG-UBA5, or the W341A and G342A single mutants, we observed increased formation of ufmylated UFBP1 species (UFBP1-UFM1, Fig. 5B) and the uncharacterized UFM1-protein conjugates (X-UFM1), for which ufmylation in turn depends on ufmylated UFBP1 (Fig. 5B).
We thus concluded that the intact LIR/UFIM is the prerequisite for the full biological activity of UBA5 toward activation and transfer of UFM1 to downstream substrates both in vitro and in cells.
The region includes the non-canonical LIR motif "WGIELV".
The structural model includes residues 6–100 of ActRII-ECD (out of 1–102) and residues 36–139 of BMP7 (out of 1–139). The N-terminal 35 amino acids of BMP7 remain disordered, as in the unbound ligand (Griffith et al. 1996).
Region 1-35 corresponds to region 293-327 of the amino acid sequence, since the natural precursor form contains a signal peptide (1-29) and a propeptide (30-292).
In  the  final  model,  there  are  two  regions  that  lack sufficient electron density: residues 160–170 of KChIP1 and 21–30 of Kv4.2, likely due to the high conformational flexibility of these regions.
Dots represent residues 160–170  of  KChIP1*  that  lack  electron  density.
Based on Supplementary Table 2 there is a disordered region between residues 774-796.

Invisible amino acids in the N- and C-terminal in the refined ERK1 model are shown by gray dot lines.
The first 23 amino acids are missing in all chains and are presumably disordered.
In both molecules, the residues 451–483, 523–539, 922–924 and 1046–1054 were disordered.
In both molecules, the residues 451–483, 523–539, 922–924 and 1046–1054 were disordered.

The C-terminal region of human eIF4GI consists of two a-helical domains, 4G/C1 and 4G/C2, joined by a 13 residue linker (Figures 1B and 2).
The linker connecting domains 4G/C1 and 4G/C2 is both highly polar and apparently flexible (10/13 residues were not visible in our electron density maps).
Ten residues in the interdomain linker of 4G/C (left) were not observed in the electron density maps and are shown as a polyalanine trace (violet).
At the final stages of refinement, NCS operators were re-evaluated, and restrained NCS refinement yielded a final model (residues
1234–1566, excluding 1428–1437 from the interdomain linker, rmsd = 0.2 A˚ for 323 a-carbon pairs) with an R factor of 24.4% and an R free of 29.2% (Table 1).

Sequence comparisons (Figure 1A), secondary structure predictions (data not shown), and limited proteolysis combined with mass spectrometry (data not shown) permitted identification of a protease-resistant C-terminal portion of human eIF4GI that supports binding to eIF4A and Mnk1 (data not shown). Further truncation (eIF4GI[1235–1572]) yielded a two-domain protein that gives high-quality crystals with two protomers per asymmetric unit (Experimental Procedures).
Limited proteolysis of the C-terminal region of human eIF4GI (residues 1080–1600) with a panel of specific endoproteases yielded a resistant core of approximately 40 kDa, as judged by gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing of proteolytic fragments mapped a large number of proteolytic cleavage sites to residues 1080–1234.

In contrast, in the free state, the same NOEs were not observed, indicating that although not a statistical random coil (Fig. 4), the unbound N is very loosely structured.
In contrast, residues 486–503 were strongly perturbed by binding and showed large downfield shifts in their Cα resonances, consistent with organization of this region into a helix in the bound state.
Residues 477–484 appear likely to lack any persistent structure in both the free and bound states, whereas residues 486–503 are both perturbed and markedly rigidified on binding
With a GST pulldown assay, we showed that MEN374-525 retained the ability to bind measles virus P (Fig. ​1A, lanes 5 and 6), consistent with prior observations (2, 24, 30, 32).
As expected the P–N complex resembles a four-helix bundle, with the helix contributed by N (helix Nα1) packed on the surface created by helices α2 and α3 of the binding domain from P.
It is clear from consideration of both crystal packing and linker length that the complex observed in the crystal results from an intermolecular association with the N moiety from one protein binding to the P moiety of a separate molecule.
Crystallographic analysis of a chimeric protein in which amino acids 486–505 from N (N486–505) were fused to the carboxyl terminus of the nucleocapsid-binding domain of P (P457–507). The two binding elements were connected with a flexible linker, (GS)4, designed to be long enough to accommodate either parallel or antiparallel packing of the helix from N.
Typical association rates for protein–protein interactions are in the order of 105 to 106 M-1·s-1 (24), hence association of the measles P-binding domain with the measles N-tail peptide proceeds relatively quickly and is approaching the diffusion-controlled limit.
IDR is 100% identical to the Measles virus (strain Edmonston B), UniProtKB:Q89933
Deletions of 10 (MEN374-515) and 20 (MEN374-505) amino acids from the tail had no effect on the ability of the molecules to bind to P in a pulldown assay (Fig.1B). However, a third construct in which 30 amino acids were deleted (MEN374-495) lost the ability to bind the P protein (Fig. ​1B). This suggested that the region from 495 to 505 within the tail of N was critical for binding P.

In the final model, the following Dom34 regions Met1-Phe47, Thr60-Tyr170, and Asp180-Asp382 could be modeled in the electron density as well as 228 water molecules, one phosphate ion from the crystallization solution and two glycerol molecules, which was used as cryoprotectant (supplemental Fig. S1B).
24 loop residues (Thr48-Ser59, Ser171-Thr179, and Asp383-Glu386) were absent in the final model due to the lack of electron density, reflecting intrinsic flexibility.
The Linker Sequence Can Be Modeled as A Worm-like Chain and Exhibits Only Weak Local Conformational Preferences RES
In contrast, the Kratky plot for the isolated linker (L) increases monotonically with the scattering angle, which is characteristic of unfolded proteins [76].
From the pair distance distribution function P(r) (Figure 4), the radius of gyration (Rg) of the linker is estimated as 26.4 Å by numerical integration. For comparison, the radius of gyration of an intrinsically disordered protein of this chain length (62 residues) is predicted to be 22.7 Å, using a power law expression developed for chemically denatured proteins [77]. Hence, the linker is globally disordered.
As expected, backbone amide resonances associated with the linker (L) showed very limited chemical shift dispersion in the proton dimension, consistent with global disorder, while those associated with the binding domain (BD) were widely dispersed, consistent with overwhelming population of the folded state [61]. The propensity for structure formation in the linker was assessed using the ncSPC algorithm (Figure S4B), based on the weighted deviation of the chemical shifts of five backbone nuclei (1Hα, 13CO, 13Cα, 13Cβ, 15N) from reference values specific for intrinsically disordered proteins [83]. The results are fairly concordant with secondary structure prediction (Figure S4A) and suggest that very weak local structural preferences for extended beta-conformation or alpha-helical conformation do exist, with these preferences alternating along the length of the linker.
Overall, the NMR analysis confirmed that the linker is not uniformly disordered. It contains localized segments with very weak conformational preferences, and there is evidence for conformational exchange occurring in some regions.
Unstructured N-terminal region of Major capsid protein of Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus 1 (PBCV-1).
Residues 141-175 , including helices G and H, which in BHA form a compact unit adjacent to the five-stranded β- sheet and part of helix D, adopt in TBHA2 a more extended, partially disordered conformation running antiparallel to the coiled coil (Fig. 3b-d).
The soluble trimeric fragment considered here, TBHA2 , is prepared from Influenza A virus hemagglutinin at pH 5, since bound virus is internalized by endocytosis and the pH of endosomes is between pH 5 and pH 6.
An a-helix, H, in BHA (159-170) and five residues beyond it, 171-175, appear to be disordered in TBHA2.
An a-helix, H, in BHA (159-170) and five residues beyond it, 171-175, appear to be disordered in TBHA2.
When incubated at the pH of fusion, BHA undergoes structural changes, two consequences of which are particularly important for investigations of the fusion-activated molecule. 
While TBHA2 is prepared from at pH 5, since bound virus is internalized by endocytosis and the pH of endosomes is between pH 5 and pH 6, BHA represents the Influenza A virus hemagglutinin at a physiological or cellular pH.
Residues 508-520 are folded in all the structures published.
The capsid N-terminal domain (NTD) is disordered and binds the negatively charged alphavirus RNA genome (Owen and Kuhn, 1996).
Despite the identification of the NTD genome-binding sequence on the capsid protein more than 20 years ago (Owen and Kuhn, 1996), the structure of this domain has remained elusive, probably because the capsid NTD sequence (Met1-Ile116 in EEEV) shows features characteristic of intrinsically disordered proteins (Uversky, 2013) with high concentrations of basic residues Arg and Lys (27% of the sequence) and structure-disrupting Pro and Gly residues (26% of the sequence).
Each capsid protein is comprised of three domains: the first ~60 residues at the N-terminal region (R), the shell (S) domain, and the protruding (P) domain (Fig. 2A). The first ~90 residues are disordered in the A and B subunits, while the first ~60 residues are disordered in the C subunit.
In all three structures, the N-terminal 20 residues were found to be disordered.
In the final model, the first 20 residues (18 in the case of chain A) have been omitted due to missing density.
Only aa 125, 126, and 147 to 149 were visible in the density map, showing that this loop is highly flexible.
The electron densities for the first 71 residues of BNP were not visible, indicating that this N-terminal region of the protein is highly flexible.
The electron densities for the first 71 residues of BNP were not visible, indicating that this N-terminal region of the protein is highly flexible.
Deletion of this loop in BNP resulted in a 14-fold decrease in the RNA-binding affinity, which is significantly more dramatic than the 6.4-fold decrease in the flexible loop-deleted ANP equivalent (21), implying that this loop in BNP contributes more to RNA binding.

Clear electron density was observed in the 2Fo-Fc map for Vif residues 140 to 155 before their inclusion in the model. These residues correspond to the Vif BC-box helix that includes the consensus sequence of SLQYLA. The C terminus of the Vif construct, containing the Cullin box, was disordered and not observed in the crystal structure.
According to the PDB 157-176 are the correct boundaries for the disordered region.
The fact that the T1 values of BC-box are consistently the same over the span of residues 144–154 indicates that this region is less dynamic and tumbles isotropically compared with the rest residues of the SOCS-box. However, it is of note that the N-terminal-fused tag attached to this region may also contribute to its limited motion.
The dispersion of the resonances in 15N-1 H HSQC spectra of Tat1–72 (Fig. (7)) is typical for disordered proteins lacking regular secondary structure and agrees with previous homonuclear NMR studies [119,120,129,140,141].
The strong negative ellipticity at 198 nm shown in Fig. (4) is characteristic of a backbone dominated by the random coil conformation. 
To obtain residue-specific information regarding the Rev ARM peptide, we recorded 1HN,15N-HSQC spectra (Fig. 2). In aqueous solution, the peptide shows little dispersion of the resonances (Fig. 2 B), indicative of an unfolded peptide and in accordance with the CD data.
CD spectra of the Rev ARM peptide in physiological buffer exhibited a minimum around 200 nm, typical of an unfolded state (Fig. 1 A).
Fig. 5 B shows that the [1HN],15N hetNOE values for Rev ARM in aqueous solution at pH 7.4 average 0.47 for residues T34–R50, consistent with a disordered peptide. In contrast, the hetNOEs of the Rev ARM peptide in complex with RRE StemIIB average 0.83 for residues T34–R50, and in 50% TFE average 0.77 for residues T34–R50. These higher hetNOE values indicate higher backbone rigidity and are typical of a well-ordered secondary structure.
RRE StemIIB it's the RNA binding Rev ARM.

We further characterized the differences in IA and IIB binding modes using amide proton chemical shifts from 15N HSQC NMR spectra to monitor changes in the peptide-RNA interfaces. There is little peak dispersion of peptide resonances in the absence of RNA (Figure 5C), indicative of a largely unstructured molecule.
We further characterized the differences in IA and IIB binding modes using amide proton chemical shifts from 15N HSQC NMR spectra to monitor changes in the peptide-RNA interfaces. There is little peak dispersion of peptide resonances in the absence of RNA (Figure 5C), indicative of a largely unstructured molecule. However, we observe substantial amide peak dispersion in the presence of either IIB (red) or IA (blue) RNAs (Figure 5C), including the Hε protons of arginine side chains (Figure 5C inset). The overall upfield shifts observed in both 1H and 15N dimensions is consistent with stabilization of peptide α-helical structure upon binding (Wang and Jardetzky, 2002).
Given, the purine-rich internal loop of IA, we asked if this amino acid also is essential for IA binding. Interestingly, mutation of Asn40 had no effect on IA binding. Conversely, mutation of Arg41, which does not affect IIB binding (Tan et al., 1993), showed a reproducible 2-fold decrease in IA affinity (Figure 5A). R38A and R46A mutants showed similar 2-fold reductions in IA affinity but had no effect on IIB, while R43A, R44A, and W45A mutants bound IA like the wild type peptide. Helical wheel projections clearly show that different surfaces of the helix are used to recognize IIB and IA RNAs (Figure 5B).
Rev–GFP showed typical predominantly nuclear localization (>80% of fluorescence) (Fig. 2A). In contrast, RevM5–GFP fluorescence was apparent mainly in the cytoplasm, with less than 22% of total fluorescence in the nucleus (Fig. 2A).
RevM5 has a mutation in this IDR.
As shown in a gel mobility shift assay (Figure 2), the addition of Rev normally leads to formation of multimeric complexes with 35S-labelled RRE.
The experiment demonstrates the specificity of the Rev-importin-β interaction, as importin-β did not bind to the GST-Rev NLS mutant, or to GST protein. This was an unexpected finding, and identifies Rev as the first protein known to contain an NLS specific for the 97 kDa importin-β receptor, and not importin-α.
Circular dichroism (CD) analysis indicated a predominant (ca. 60%) random coil content for both constructs, in line with a high degree of disorder predicted for the GRR, with N-FATZ-1 having a lower α-helical content than Δ91-FATZ-1 (Fig. 1D).
The two constructs, N-FATZ-1 and Δ91-FATZ-1, correspond to regions 1- 174 and 92-299, respectively. The IDR corresponds to region 95-175.
The calculation of the compaction index using hydrodynamic radius (Rh) values derived from size exclusion chromatography (SEC) combined with dynamic light scattering (DLS) and viscometry measurements (table S1) (31), together with the analysis of the 222/200 ellipticity ratio, indicated a premolten globule for N-FATZ-1 and an increased content of regular secondary structure for Δ91-FATZ-1.
The two constructs, N-FATZ-1 and Δ91-FATZ-1, correspond to regions 1- 174 and 92-299, respectively. The IDR corresponds to region 95-175.
We further characterized N-FATZ-1 and Δ91-FATZ-1 using SEC combined with SAXS. The resulting scattering profiles and dimensionless Kratky plots are characteristic of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), and subsequent modeling indicates that both constructs are best described as a conformational ensemble (Fig. 1, F to J, and Supplementary Results) (32). In addition, we derived the radius of gyration (Rg) of N-FATZ-1 and Δ91-FATZ-1 from analysis of SAXS data (table S2) and obtained Rg/Rh ratios of 1.1 to 1.2 that are, once again, consistent with the presence of IDRs (33).
The two constructs, N-FATZ-1 and Δ91-FATZ-1, correspond to regions 1- 174 and 92-299, respectively. The IDR corresponds to region 95-175.
These results, demonstrating the intrinsically disordered/ensemble-state nature of N-FATZ-1 and Δ91-FATZ-1, are further supported by the 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra recorded for both constructs, which display a narrow chemical shift range in the proton dimension, as is typical for IDR-containing proteins (fig. S5A).
The two constructs, N-FATZ-1 and Δ91-FATZ-1, correspond to regions 1- 174 and 92-299, respectively. The IDR corresponds to region 95-175.
The spectrum obtained in detergent-free buffer showed a pronounced minimum at 199 nm indicative of a predominantly unordered protein.
Continuous stretches with prominent chemical shift changes were observed for residues 39–51 and 64–78. In contrast, amide chemical shifts of residues 52–63 were virtually unaffected by the presence of DPC micelles.

In contrast, characteristic secondary shifts of VpUcyt observed in the presence of 100 mm DPC clearly indicated the formation of two helices (Fig. 3, right column).
On the basis of the three sets of secondary shift data in Fig. 3 (right), the helices probably range from I39 to E48 (helix 2) and from L64 to R70 (helix 3).
The fractional helicity of amino acid stretches 39–48 (helix 2) and 64–70 (helix 3) was estimated by comparing the observed average secondary shifts with the values expected for a regular helix. This procedure provided fractional helicities of ∼ 80% (Δδ13Cα) for helix 2 and 40% (Δδ1Hα) for helix 3.

VpUcyt appears to be unstructured in buffer.
Continuous stretches with prominent chemical shift changes were observed for residues 39–51 and 64–78.
We propose that the structure of micelle-associated VpUcyt is a reasonable approximation of the physiologically relevant membrane-attached cytoplasmic region of VpU. This view is supported by the experimentally confirmed location of VpUcyt at the micelle–water interface. The polar headgroup of DPC is chemically identical to that of the large fraction of phospholipids in biological membranes that feature a phosphatidylcholine headgroup.

Though it is possible to ‘‘refine’’ the models to working R factors below 20%, the structural models presented herein have good geometry and are at apparent free R-factor minima, values of which are likely limited by disorder that prevents modeling of residues 107–128.
The Fhit–IB2 structures, like those of the first Fhit structures, contains an amino-terminal b-hairpin not found in Hint and a gap from residue 107 to residue 127 or to 128 that is disordered (Fig. 2).
Residues 107-127 are disordered in all structures.
Our data demonstrate that Fhit is a target of tyrosine phosphorylation by the Src protein kinase. We show that Src phosphorylates Y114 of Fhit in vitro and in vivo, providing insight into a biochemical pathway involved in Fhit signaling.
Here we report that Fhit is a target of tyrosine phosphorylation by Src protein kinase. We show that Src phosphorylates Y114 of Fhit in vitro and in vivo and therefore provide important clues to biochemical mechanisms involved in Fhit signaling.
To identify which tyrosine is phosphorylated, a trypsin digest of fraction 3 was analyzed by HPLC-ion-trap mass spectrometry. Only peptide 110-119 was phosphorylated, and the fragmentation pattern of the peptide was compatible only with Y114 being phosphorylated and not S112 (Fig. 3E).
Thus, the mass spectrometry data demonstrated that fraction 3 is Fhit phosphorylated on Y114 on both subunits.
The data clearly show that Fhit is phosphorylated on tyrosine 114 by Src kinase both in vitro and in vivo.

Here we report that Fhit is a target of tyrosine phosphorylation by Src protein kinase. We show that Src phosphorylates Y114 of Fhit in vitro and in vivo and therefore provide important clues to biochemical mechanisms involved in Fhit signaling.
To determine which tyrosine is phosphorylated in vivo by Src, several Fhit mutants were created, FhitY114F, FhitY145F and FhitY114F, Y145F, individually cotransfected with the activated SRC construct, and checked for tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blotting. Phosphorylated Fhit was detected on expression of WT Fhit or FhitY145F (Fig. 4B Top, lanes 2 and 4) but not FhitY114F or FhitY114F, Y145F (Fig. 4B Top, lanes 3 and 5). The tyrosine phosphorylation was confirmed by using antiphosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 4B Bottom). These results confirmed that Y114 of Fhit is a target of Src phosphorylation in vivo.
The data clearly show that Fhit is phosphorylated on tyrosine 114 by Src kinase both in vitro and in vivo.
Residues 2–31 in the N-terminal region and residues 207–220 in the C-terminal tail were not visible in the electron-density maps and thus were not included in the model.
Residues 2-31 and 207-220 are missing in all chains and are presumably disordered.

No electron density was observed for residues 2–23 of DUSP14, suggesting that this region of the protein is disordered.
Four structural motifs important for Vpr's interaction with partners are discernible: a random-coil N-terminal tail; a hydrophobic cleft formed by helices α1, α2 and the first turn of α3; the loop connecting α2 and α3 (insert loop); and the C-terminal region of helix α3 (Supplementary Fig. 2a).
The PDB has low resolution in the N-terminal tail and the figure shows the disorder of this region of Vpr.
Vpr interacts with DCAF1 by using its N terminus and helix α3 (described below) and interacts with UNG2 via the insert loop and residues in the hydrophobic cleft, burying a surface area of 1,650 Å2 and 940 Å2, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2b).
(c) Detailed view of the interaction between the N-terminal tail of Vpr and residues of DCAF1 at the edges of two propeller blades. 
The CD value at 222 nm of the zinc-free Tat was closer to zero than that of the zinc-bound form. Moreover, a negative peak at ∼202 nm, which is an index of the presence of random-coil structures, is more prominent upon removal of zinc ions.
Authors claim the use of the isolate HXB2 however the sequence they report in Figure 1. corresponds to this Uniprot.
The CD spectrum of the zinc-bound Tat had a minimum at 202 nm and a CD value close to zero at 222 nm, indicating that Tat is largely disordered (Fig. 2A). However, a slightly negative shoulder around 222 nm suggests the presence of residual helical structures. 
Therefore, the structure of zinc-bound Tat at neutral pH corresponds to a pre-molten globule state.
Authors claim the use of the isolate HXB2 however the sequence they report in Figure 1. corresponds to this Uniprot.
The absence of a peak in the Kratky plot of the zinc-bound Tat indicates largely disordered structures (Fig. 3B). However, the presence of a plateau without a linear increase in wide-angle regions suggests that the protein molecule is not completely unfolded [24].
Comparison of the scaling curves with the Rg of Tat shows that the molecular size of Tat is close to but slightly more compact than the fully unfolded state.
Authors claim the use of the isolate HXB2 however the sequence they report in Figure 1. corresponds to this Uniprot.
The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of the zinc-bound Tat showed line broadening due to conformational dynamics in the intermediate exchange regime (Fig. 2B), suggesting structural fluctuation in millisecond time scales.
Authors claim the use of the isolate HXB2 however the sequence they report in Figure 1. corresponds to this Uniprot.
The pH titration of CD spectra at pH values from 7 to 4 showed that the ellipticity at 222 nm increased with decreasing pH and exhibited a cooperative helix unfolding transition around pH 5–5.5 (Fig. 4A and B). The CD spectra below pH 5 were coincident with that of zinc-free Tat (Fig. 2, Fig. 4A,B), indicating that both the decrease in pH and the removal of zinc ions have identical effects on the secondary structure of Tat.
Taken together, the results indicate that Tat at pH 4 is in a random coil-like fully unfolded state.
Authors claim the use of the isolate HXB2 however the sequence they report in Figure 1. corresponds to this Uniprot.
These results indicate that Tat loses residual helices, which were present in the zinc-bound form, and turns into disordered structures upon removal of zinc ions.
Authors claim the use of the isolate HXB2 however the sequence they report in Figure 1. corresponds to this Uniprot.
The ICP-MS measurement revealed that 59.2 ± 0.8 μM zinc ions were present in 25.0 ± 0.2 μM Tat, indicating that the concentration ratio of Tat to zinc ions was 1:2.
Authors claim the use of the isolate HXB2 however the sequence they report in Figure 1. corresponds to this Uniprot.
As shown in Fig. 1A, the peptide assumes a random-coil conformation in aqueous buffer and a more defined structure in the presence of SDS micelles, where it displays a typical helical structure.

Fluorescence emission in the absence of SDS shows a maximum emission wavelength of ∼337 nm (Fig. 1B). This maximum reflects the tryptophan accessibility and the peptide aggregation because of its high hydrophobicity and random structure.
In fact, when EBO16 was incubated with SDS micelles, the spectral peak was blue-shifted from 337 to 324 nm (Fig. 1B). The shift of about 13 nm suggests that tryptophan enters a hydrophobic environment in the SDS micelles.
In the absence of SDS micelles, a steep slope is observed (Ksv = 15.8 m-1), whereas in the presence of SDS micelles a reduced slope is obtained (Ksv = 10.2 m-1). The fluorescence data clearly indicate that the single Trp of EBO16 is protected by the micelle from quenching. EBO16 in the micellar environment undergoes structural modifications including intramolecular rearrangements and acquisition of helical structure, showing a tendency to self-associate.
Taken together, the NOE connectivities and chemical shift deviation data support the presence of a helix from Leu-6 to Phe-12 (Fig. 2, A and B). This was also observed in 40, 100, and 200 mm SDS, which confirms a stable interaction between the peptide and SDS at concentrations above the critical micellar concentration (data not shown).
Because EBO16 is very flexible when free in solution, it did not show NOEs during the 80 ms of mixing time.
The NOESY spectrum of EBO16 in the presence of DRMs showed transfer NOEs for all residues ranging from Leu-6 to Phe-12 (Fig. 4A). We also observed transferred NOEs for the residues ranging from Leu-6 to Ile-9 for EBO16 in the presence of LUVs containing PC/PE/PI/Cho.
LUV stands for large unilamellar vesicle, while DRM stands for detergent-resistant membrane fraction, which where obtained from cells.

 These data are the first indication that EBO16 can interact with DRMs in an early stage of infection.
No electron density is observed for residues 190-213, 311-312, 464-501 and 600-632. Weak or discontinuous electron density is seen in the loop containing the GP1-GP2 disulfide bridge (residues 49-56) and the outer regions of the GP1 glycan cap (residues 268-278 and 299-310); these regions are modeled as poly-alanine fragments.
Chain O shown in the PDB, lacks electron density up to the 212 residue, for this reason the disorder region is describe in the 190-212 region.

IDR is 100% identical to the Zaire ebolavirus Kikwit-95 strain (DP035378) assessed in this publication.
We found that, independent of pH, EBOV MPER/TM consists of an unstructured N-terminal region and a short helix in the MPER region that is followed by a turn and the TM helix: i.e., MPER/TM forms a helix-turn-helix motif.
The ensemble is characterized by an unstructured N-terminal region (residues D632 to N641), a helical MPER region (D642 to Q650), a turn (W651 to I656), and a TM helical region (G657 to F676).

Importantly, both the N- and C-terminal arms of the Z protein remain highly flexible when bound to the L polymerase, which offers an opportunity for the Z protein to simultaneously interact with multiple binding partners.

The final model included 513 of the 569 residues (excluding FLAG and His tags) of LASV NP. The regions comprising residues 1–7, 147–157, 339–363, 517–521, and 562–569 were disordered and could not be identified in the electron density.

Vpr is unstructured at neutral pH, whereas under acidic conditions or upon addition of trifluorethanol it adopts alpha-helical structures.
The one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra (Figs. 5 and6) show a further phenomenon; in both pure aqueous as well as 50% TFE solutions the protein has some regions that show particularly broad lines, whereas at least several parts of the molecule appear to be relatively flexible resulting in sharper lines.

The peptide is completely unstructured at neutral pH, whereas lowering the pH to a critical threshold of pH 5.0 or adding a membrane mimetic, such as TFE, stabilizes secondary structure that is mainly α-helical in character.
sVpr Is Transduced Efficiently and Induces G2Cell Cycle Arrest
HeLa cells were incubated with sVpr labeled with a Cy3-like fluorophor that allows effective sorting of the transduced cells. WhensVpr-Cy3 was added at concentrations of 2, 5, and 10 μg ml−1, flow cytometric studies revealed dose-dependent uptake of sVpr-Cy3 from the medium (71, 92, and 97% of the cells, respectively) (Fig.9 A). When cells were incubated with sVpr-Cy3 at 2 μg ml−1 and sorted based on fluorescence, 30% of the positive cells were arrested in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. In contrast, only 13% of cells of the non-transduced cell population were present in G2/M (Fig. 9 B). These data strongly suggest that sVpr is biologically active and is able to induce G2 cell cycle arrest in susceptible cells.
These studies revealed that sVpr-488 effectively entered cells following its addition in the extracellular medium (in a process termed as protein transduction) and further accumulated in the nucleus of these transduced cells (Fig.7).
Confocal microscopy revealed that in HeLa cells the transduced peptide sVpr-488 appears to be occasionally concentrated in cytosolic spots, whereas the majority of the peptide was clearly localized in the nucleus (Fig. 7,C and D). These data, together with our preliminary observation that sVpr activates HIV-1 replication and is specifically incorporated into budding HIV-1 virions (data not shown), provide evidence that sVpr possesses biological activities similar to those of viral Vpr.
Extracellular Vpr protein increases cellular permissiveness to human immunodeficiency virus replication and reactivates virus from latency
In addition, extracellular Vpr reactivated HIV-1 expression in five latently infected cell lines of T-cell, B-cell, and promonocytic origin which normally express very low levels of HIV RNA and protein, indicating an activation of translational or pretranslational events in the virus life cycle.
Extracellular Vpr protein increases cellular permissiveness to human immunodeficiency virus replication and reactivates virus from latency

The final model contains residues 59-416 of GP  monomer A, with disordered regions from 171-179, 209-210, 256-259 and 329-330; residues 59- 418 of GP monomer B, with disordered regions from 170-179, 209-210, and 256-259; residues  59-418 of GP monomer C, with disordered regions from 170-179, 209-210, and 256-259 and  329-330 and Fab 37.7H residues 2-225 of the heavy chain (chains D, F and H), with a disordered  region from 159-165 and residues 3-213 of the light chain (chains E, G and L).
Missing electron density region in the C-terminus of Marburgvirus VP24.
The construct crystallized was the complete mVP40, containing residues 1 to 303 (Fig. 1 and ​and2).2). Of these, the N terminus (residues 1 to 37 in molecule 1 and 1 to 35 in molecule 2) and a few short loops (residues 71 to 72, 156 to 157, and 264 to 267 in molecule 1 and residues 216 to 218, 259 to 260, 264 to 269, and 302 to 303 in molecule 2) were disordered.
Of the three molecules of CCHFV N in the asymmetric unit, we were able to observe clear electron density only of the flexible linker residues 181 to 195 connecting the stalk domain and the globular body domain in molecule B (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). The linker is not visible in molecules B and C, and unobserved disordered residues include 181 to 194 in molecule A and 181 to 195 in molecule C.

A natively unfolded yeast prion monomer adopts an ensemble of collapsed and rapidly fluctuating structures
These results establish that the monomeric form of NM adopts an ensemble of relatively unordered states with rapid conformational fluctuations.
We have used single-molecule and small-ensemble techniques to directly study the conformational properties of NM in physiological buffers in the non-prion monomeric state. Our results demonstrate that natively unfolded NM is not a completely denatured random coil under these conditions. Instead, it occupies an ensemble of rapidly interconverting compact conformations.
Our finding that the N region of native NM is significantly more compact than a corresponding denatured protein (40) then identifies it with the premolten globule class of natively unfolded proteins. It has been noted that a combination of low mean hydrophobicity and high charge is a prerequisite for maintaining a flexible, unstructured state under physiological conditions (49). The amyloid core of Sup35 (N region) contains only 8% hydrophobic and 4% charged amino acids. Our results indicate that the core N region remains compact and flexible despite lacking both hydrophobic and charged residues.
The electron density map of the IPNV SVP displays unambiguous density for most of the polypeptide chain, allowing the visualization of residues 6 to 428 of VP2, with a break in density between amino acids 110 to 117 at the distal tip of domain S, which appears disordered (Fig.11 and ​and2C).
The crystal structure of the complex between full-length VP1 and VP3 was solved by molecular replacement using the structure of IPNV VP1 (9) as a search model and refined to a resolution of 2.2 Å with residual Rxpct = 0.179 and Rfree = 0.215 (Table 1). The final structure is of high stereochemical quality with 98% of the residues occupying the favored region of the Ramachandran plot. Three copies of VP1 are present in the asymmetric unit (AU) of the crystal, and electron density was observed from residues 27 to 792 for each chain of VP1 (no density was observed for residues 1 to 26 and 793 to 845).

Despite being crystallized in the presence of Mn2+ and ATP, no metal ions or nucleotides were observed at the active site. While additional electron density was seen connected to the C-terminus of the molecular replacement search model in three of the four copies of VP1 present in the asymmetric unit only eight additional residues (791–798) could be placed, suggesting that residues 799–845 are not ordered.
Both full-length and ΔC55 VP1 yield RNA/DNA hybrids of various heterologous ssRNA templates, ΔC55 being roughly 5-fold more active than the full-length enzyme, while ΔN27C55 VP1 reverse transcriptase activity is extremely low (Table 1, Figure 4).

All the profiles are featureless, and the Kratky plots [s2I(s) vs s] are without apparent peaks (Supporting Information Figure 3), which is typical for unfolded proteins.
Table 1 indicates that the larger constructs (ht23 and ht40) have Rg values close to or smaller than the predicted random coil values, which are shown by ref 29 to agree well with the experimental data from chemically unfolded proteins (note that as tau constructs are not denatured using chemicals the random coil estimations cannot be considered ideal predictions, but they do provide a useful guidance).
For full length constructs (ht40 and ht23), little difference from the pool distribution was observed (typical models of ht40 selected from the random pools are displayed in Figure 4 to demonstrate that the protein is indeed rather unstructured).
The experimental electron density map is of great quality except that the N-terminal 1–13 residues were disordered without electron density and therefore were omitted in the final model.
Two regions of polypeptide that are not visible in the electron density map are assumed to be disordered. These are residues 322-325, which connect the α-helices a7 and a8, and the C-terminal 18 residues.
The last 14 residues are disordered in the structure.
The linker regions in ΔGag exhibit low 15N-{1H} heteronuclear NOE values, close to zero 1DNH RDC values, and nearly random coil chemical shifts (Fig. 4, Table S3, and Fig. S2), indicative of intrinsic disorder and high mobility such that the ordered structural domains are like beads on a string. These regions include the large stretch of residues connecting MA to CA (residues 110–148), the C-terminal tail of CA (residues 353–363) and the SP1 region that connects CA to the N-terminal zinc-knuckle of NC (residues 364–377), and the linker (residues 408–412, especially residues 411 and 412) that connects the N- and C-terminal zinc knuckles of NC. Overall, these flexible, solvent exposed regions are primarily responsible for extreme sensitivity of Gag to proteolysis and conformational heterogeneity that precludes crystallization.

In intact ΔGag, the N-terminal residues of CA (residues 133–145) are intrinsically disordered and exhibit narrow chemical shift dispersion (see above and Fig. S2). As proteolysis of ΔGag proceeds, new 1HN/15N cross-peaks appear in the spectrum and grow in intensity with time (Fig. 5A). A few of these can be readily assigned by reference to the spectrum of isolated CA. Among these Ile134, Val135, Asn137, Gly140, Met142, Val143, His144, and Gln145 are directly involved in the formation of the β-hairpin (residues 133–145) and exhibit completely different chemical shifts (labeled in blue in Fig. 5A) compared with their unstructured counterparts.

The main difficulty in determining the NMR Tat structure was to resolve the sequential assignment [23]. This was due to the high number of peak overlaps in the homonuclear 1H NMR spectra, repetitive sequences and the presence of 11 prolines.
This could be due to the absence of α-helix and β-sheet and the flexibility of the Tat backbone, which induces the poor dispersion of our NMR spectra. However, the nanomolar activities observed with Tat indicate that Tat certainly has a conserved folding. We identified 272 long-range NOEs that would have almost disappeared with a random coil. The long-range NOEs, observed with almost each residue (figure 6), suggest a certain stability of our structure compared to the one studied by Bayer et al.
The Tatwt construct did indeed result in a high level of luciferase expression (Fig. 1C). The TatY26A variant showed an approximately 4-fold-reduced luciferase level, which confirms that the Y26A mutation significantly reduces Tat activity. In agreement with their inability to produce functional Tat protein, the Tatstop and Tatfs constructs resulted in very low luciferase levels that are indistinguishable from the background level obtained upon cotransfection of a control plasmid instead of HIV-rtTA.
The six synthetic Tat proteins can bind to TAR RNA (Fig.3) and can inhibit PKR (data not shown). 
In aqueous buffer (Fig. 4 A), it can be deduced from the intensity of the negative 200 nm band that nonorganized structures are predominant (29). TableI reveals that there is no α helix in aqueous buffer excepted for Tat Mal and Tat Z2, which could have a short helix of eight to nine residues. 
In each case, Tat was added to the cell buffer, and therefore expression of β-gal up to the control means that the synthetic Tat was able to cross the cytoplasmic and nucleus membranes, bind TAR, and interact with cellular cofactors.
Tat Bru can trans-activate HIV-1 LTR whereas Tat Oyi cannot, but they are both phosphorylated by PKR.
At 10 μm, the six Tat were showing levels of trans-activation so high that it was impossible to see differences between them because there was saturation.

Tat Mal and Tat Eli show a level of trans-activation three to four times higher to that of Tat Bru.
The major result of trans-activation tests was the high activity of Tat Mal and Tat Eli, which correlates with the high virulence of these two HIV-1 isolates.
Similar results were obtained with another transfection assay using luciferase as gene reporter, and Tat Mal and Tat Eli at 1 μm did trans-activate the LTR to a level comparable with that obtained with a transfected pCMV-Tat (data not shown).

The domain structure of this recombinant protein was probed by limited protease digestion using trypsin, endoprotease Lys-C and thermolysin. These proteases digest P to protease-resistant fragments that migrate on SDS-PAGE with apparent molecular masses of 15–16 kDa (Figure 3 A–C).
N-terminal sequencing of the fragment obtained after trypsin digestion showed that cleavage had occurred after R172. The apparent mass of the fragment from SDS-PAGE suggests that it contains residues 173–297.
We carried out systematic site-directed mutagenesis at those sites, altering S or T to A, expressed the mutant proteins in E. coli, and then purified and tested them for phosphorylation by RVPK and PKC. As shown in Fig. 6, altering S162 and S210 to A resulted in a drastic reduction in the ability of PKC to phosphorylate P protein (95%), whereas phosphorylation by RVPK was reduced by only 25%. These results suggest that PKC phosphorylation sites are probably S162, S210, and S271, which are presumably different from the RVPK sites which may be located at a different domain in the P protein.
Finally, we delineated more precisely the part of IDD2 domain which is required for phase separation. Deletion of residues 151–181 did not affect P ability to form NB-like structures (Fig. 6e). Therefore, only the amino-terminal part of IDD2 (residues 132–150) is required for this process. This was confirmed by the deletion of residues 139–151, which abolished spherical inclusions formation (Fig. 6e).
Two regions in N (NTD: 105 to 118 and CTD: 376 to 397) are presumably flexible, because they are absent in the structure (Fig. 1C and fig. S1).

This IDR is 100% identical to the Rabies virus (strain ERA).
The NTD adopts the same nine-helix fold as present in previously determined crystal structures 12–14. The CTD, in contrast, is largely disordered, consistent with previous observations 24 and does not adopt detectable tertiary structure when pH is increased (Extended Data Fig. 4c).
The PDB shows missing residues for this region.
The NTD-CTD interface appears to be stabilized by charge complementarity between the negatively charged membrane-distal surface of the NTD (residues Glu-8, Glu-23, Glu-29, Asp-30), and the positively charged interacting surface of the CTD (residues Lys-187, Arg-210, Arg-217), as well as by an inter-molecular salt bridge between Lys-21 and Glu-176 (Fig. 3c).
Polymerization is associated with extension of helix 9 and transition of the CTD from an unfolded to folded state, upon which it interacts with the NTD of the neighboring M1 molecule in the strand.

This arrangement implies that virus assembly will be processive – binding of M1 into the filament induces conformational changes that create new interfaces promoting binding of the next monomer.

The N-terminal 73 amino-acid residues of NS1 form a symmetrical homodimeric RNA-binding domain (RBD) [23], [24], [25], [26], which is connected to the central effector domain (ED; residues 86-204) via an inter-domain linker [27]. The final ~25 residues of NS1 appear to be unstructured, and are termed the C-terminal flexible ‘tail’ (FT) ( Fig. 1A ) [28].
Neither the inter-domain linker nor the flexible ‘tail’ have been observed in crystal structures, and are therefore represented schematically.

Here, we report crystal structures of alphavirus RdRp from both RRV and SINV determined at 2.6 Å and 1.9 Å resolution respectively (Table 1). Having a dynamic structure, the RRV RdRp contains several disordered segments and some electron density in the RNA binding tunnel remains unassigned. The SINV RdRp adopts an overall fold similar to RRV RdRp but appears more ordered: residues that were disordered in the RRV nsP4 crystal structure are now well resolved in SINV RdRp and almost fully occupy the central RNA binding tunnel.
Conversely, missing residues in SINV RdRp are located in N-terminal fingertips (index residues 91–103, flex residues 167–178, pinky residues 206–210, and ring residues 288–307) and C-terminus residues (residues 603–611) (Figure 2). The relatively large number of missing residues of the RRV RdRp structure suggests a highly dynamic structure which is also detected in the HDX measurement (see below, Figure 2).

Given its low molecular mass of 12.6 kDa, the recombinant NTD is amenable to structural characterization via NMR in solution. The NTD selected from RRV contains 107 amino acids with an expected number of 99 cross-peaks (excluding Pro residues) in the 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum. From these, ∼60 cross-peaks could be observed, making backbone resonance assignments challenging (Supplementary Figure S6). The narrow dispersion of the cross-peaks in the spectrum suggests that the NTD contains flexible and helical regions that support the NTD homology model and are in agreement with the HDX profile (Figure 2A, C and Supplementary Figure S6).

The NTD selected from RRV contains 107 amino acids with an expected number of 99 cross-peaks (excluding Pro residues) in the 1H-15N-HSQC spectrum. From these, ∼60 cross-peaks could be observed, making backbone resonance assignments challenging (Supplementary Figure S6). The narrow dispersion of the cross-peaks in the spectrum suggests that the NTD contains flexible and helical regions that support the NTD homology model and are in agreement with the HDX profile (Figure 2A, C and Supplementary Figure S6).

The N-terminal tail (residues 1–32) exhibits negative or near zero {1H}-15N hetNOE values, suggesting the unstructured characteristic of this region.
The N-terminal extension (residues 1–32) is not presented for clarity as it is highly flexible and only a restricted number of NOEs were observed in this region.
Comparable low heteronuclear NOE values are observed for residues 1–32 in the N-terminal extension for both the free and CaM/Ca2+-bound NTD indicating that this region exhibits increased conformational mobility on (sub)-nanosecond time scales. 
However, striking differences are observed for the local tumbling correlation times (τc, Fig. 2b) and T2 values (Supplementary Fig. S1) values for residues 11–26 in the N-terminal extension upon binding of the NTD to CaM/Ca2+. This indicates the presence of conformational exchange processes at μs-ms timescales that are linked to the interaction with CaM/Ca2+.
In the reciprocal experiment, addition of unlabeled CaM/Ca2+ to the 15N-labeled NTD generated noticeable changes in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum, which were mapped primarily to the N-terminal extension of the NTD, mainly for residues Ala16, Arg17 and Phe19 – Glu24 (Fig. 4b,c).
Taken together, these data suggest that the N-terminal extension of FKBP38 is directly involved in a molecular interaction with CaM/Ca2+.
A comparison of the 2D 1H- 15N HSQC spectra of the NTD (residues 1–149) and the FKBD38 (residues 33–149) (Fig. 3a) confirmed the structural similarity of the NTD and the FKDB38. However, differences in chemical shifts are observed for residues in the core domain, consistent with autoinhibitory interactions between the N-terminal extension and the core domain. As summarized in Figs. 3b and 3c, most of these perturbed residues were localized in a defined region, including residues Ser58, Lys62, Gly63 and Gln64 in the β1/β2-loop; Val65 in strand β2; Phe88 and Thr89 in β4; and Asp92, Cys93, Asp94, Val95 and Ile96 in the β4/α1-loop and close to the putative isomerase active site.
As seen in Table 1, consistent with a previous study8, the isomerase activity of the full-length FKBP38 was activated by the addition of CaM/Ca2+. Interestingly, the FKBD38 showed similar levels of PPIase activity in the absence of CaM/Ca2+, suggesting that either the N- or C-terminal extensions were inhibitory and responsive to CaM/Ca2+. We then identified that NTD, a fragment of FKBP38, containing the N-terminal extension, but lacking the C-terminal extension, was activated by the addition of CaM/Ca2+ (Table 1). Taken together, the data suggest that the core isomerase activity of FKBP38 is inhibited by the N-terminal extension residues flanking the isomerase domain and that this inhibition is overcome by the addition of CaM/Ca2+.
The core isomerase activity of FKBP38 is inhibited by transient interactions involving the flexible N-terminal extension that precedes the catalytic domain.
Interestingly, this FKBP381–165 variant showed a considerably higher stability in the presence of Ca2q-CaM compared to FKBP3835–153, but the 1 H/15N-HSQC spectra were dominated by a large number of very strong amide signals with narrow line-width that belong to the evidently non-structured segments Met1-Glu34 and Asp151-Asn165.

In the reverse experiment, upon titration with Ca2q-CaM strong CSP as well as line-broadening effects were observed at the Glu-rich N-terminus of 15N-labeled FKBP381–165 (Figure 4D), in particular within the segment Ala9-Glu26. The line-broadening effects, which were most pronounced for residues Leu15, Arg17, Leu20, Ala22, Met23 and Glu24, imply that this non-structured Glu-rich region interacts directly with CaM, or more precisely with helix A of the N-terminal CaM lobe which had exhibited additional binding-related effects compared to the experiments with the shorter FKBP3835–153 variant (Figure 4C).
Interestingly, the CSP effects found for 15N-labeled Ca2qCaM in the presence of the FKBP381–165 variant are similarly strong as in the case of FKBP3835–153 (Figure 4C),
suggesting that the contribution of the FKBP38 segment Ala9-Glu26 to this protein-protein interaction is only of minor importance.
The lack of electron density in this region, shown in the PDB, indicates an IDR.
Using arrays of overlapping 20‐mer peptides of FKBP8 moved by increments of three amino acids to cover the full‐length sequence, we detected a single LIR motif in the N‐terminus with the core sequence FEVL (Fig 1B).
Taken together, these results allowed the conclusion that FKBP8 contains a canonical N‐terminal LIR motif that interacts preferentially with LC3A in vivo.
LIR motif coresponds to the 24-27 region.
Mutations in the core LIR motif resulted in a significantly reduced FKBP8 binding to the ATG8 proteins (Fig 1C and D). Quantitation of the FKBP8 interactions shows high‐affinity binding toward GABARAPL1 and LC3A (Fig 1D), low‐affinity binding toward GABARAPL2 and LC3C, and intermediary‐affinity binding toward LC3B and GABARAP.
LIR motif coresponds to the 24-27 region.
To investigate whether FKBP8 interacts with the ATG8 homologs in vivo, GFP‐tagged ATG8 proteins were co‐expressed with Flag‐tagged wild‐type (WT) or LIR‐mutated FKBP8 in HeLa cells, before immunoprecipitations using a Flag antibody. Efficient co‐precipitation of LC3A, and a weaker but significant co‐precipitation of LC3B were observed (Fig 1E). Surprisingly, only moderate co‐precipitation of GABARAP and no co‐precipitations of GABARAPL1 and GABARAPL2 were detected (Fig 1E). Consistent with the in vitro data, the FKBP8 LIR mutant did not co‐precipitate any of the ATG8 homologs.
LIR motif coresponds to the 24-27 region.
To investigate if the co‐localization of LC3A and FKBP8 is mediated by the FKBP8 LIR motif, a Cerulean‐FKBP8 LIR mutant (F24A/L27A, hereafter denoted LIRm) was co‐expressed with EYFP‐LC3A and mCherry‐OMP25TM in the HeLa cells. Strikingly, the FKBP8 LIRm is localized both on the mitochondria and on ER, but it fails completely to co‐localize with LC3A upon CCCP treatment (Fig 3A–C). Instead, LC3A forms visible aggregates that do not overlap with the mCherry‐OMP25TM probe (Fig 3A), similarly as the vector control (Fig EV3A). Together, these results suggest that CCCP treatment induces a LIR‐mediated interaction between FKBP8 and LC3A, and this interaction is important for mitochondrial recruitment of LC3A.
Taken together, our results show that FKBP8 mediates LIR‐dependent recruitment of LC3A to damaged mitochondria.
Importantly, the mitochondrial acidification was LIR dependent, and enhanced when FKBP8 was specifically targeted to the mitochondria (Fig 5B).
We find here that FKBP8 promotes mitophagy by LIR‐dependent recruitment of LC3A, independent of the PINK1‐Parkin pathway.
LIR motif coresponds to the 24-27 region.
These two FKBP8 mutants all showed an impaired ability to degrade mitochondria under normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Figure 5F,G,H).
LIR motif coresponds to the 24-27 region.
Expression analysis of those mutants revealed that FKBP8 LIR mutant failed to bind to GFP-LC3B and recruit it onto the mitochondria (Figure 5B,C), consistent with the previous report.

Broken lines separate the unfolded regions 146–158 and 188–190 from the α-helical regions 159–165, 166–184, and 185–187 regions that have different flexibility.
In contrast, the residues 146–158 and 188–190 from the N- and C termini, respectively, have nearly unrestricted mobility, resulting in low and negative 15N{1H} NOEs and decreased local rotation correlation times τR, estimated from the T1/T2 ratio (Fig. 3).
The residues 146-158 of the analized construct coresponds to the 211-223 region of the BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3.
 It is noteworthy that the isolated SNARE region of STX17 is intrinsically disordered based on the CD analysis (Fig. 5A), consistent with the aforementioned NMR results (SI Appendix, Fig. S2).
The small dispersion of the NMR peaks in the 1H dimension of the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum together with the determined secondary structure of this STX17 Qa-SNARE region based on the 13Cα and 13Cβ chemical shift values of each residue after backbone chemical shift assignments indicated that the isolated STX17 Qa-SNARE motif is basically unstructured (SI Appendix, Fig. S2).
Interestingly, titration of the 15N-labeled STX17(142–228) with the unlabeled STX17(1–123) protein showed that a selected set of peaks in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of STX17(142–228) underwent significant dose-dependent peak broadening or chemical shift changes (Fig. 1B), indicating that the STX17 Qa-SNARE region can specifically interact with the N-terminal Habc domain of STX17. Further plotting of the peak broadening and amide backbone chemical shift changes as a function of residue number revealed that the significant perturbations are mainly rich in the N-terminal part of the STX17 Qa-SNARE motif (residues 174 to 194) (Fig. 1C), suggesting that this region is the major binding site for interacting with the STX17 Habc domain.
The 1H15N HSQC spectra of STX17 Habc domain saturated with STX17(167-215) and STX17(151-196) are almost identical to that with STX17(142-228), suggesting that STX17(167-196) contains the essential sequences for the binding with STX17 Habc domain.
Interestingly, we found that the newly appeared NMR peaks arose from residues 94 to 121, which are located in the predicted extreme C-terminal α-helix of the Habc domain (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A), but were demonstrated to be unstructured in the presence of STX17(142–228) based on our NMR analysis (SI Appendix, Fig. S4C).
Taken together, all these data clearly demonstrated that the Qa-SNARE motif of STX17 can directly bind to the STX17 Habc domain and alter its conformation by partially unfolding its extreme C-terminal α-helix.
STX17 SNARE region is comprised by the 167-224 residues and the Habc domain by the 1-123 residues.
However, unlike that of Syntaxin1, the binding of the STX17 SNARE motif to its Habc domain can induce a partial unfolding of the extreme C-terminal α-helix of the STX17 Habc domain (Fig. 1D and SI Appendix, Fig. S4C). 
NMR-based analyses showed that both GABARAP and LC3A can interact with STX17(142–228) (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix, Fig. S13A), and the major binding sites on STX17 are located within the N-terminal part (residues 170 to 191) of the STX17 Qa-SNARE motif (Fig. 3B and SI Appendix, Fig. S13B). 
The obtained ITC results showed that the W172Q mutation dramatically reduces and totally abolishes the interaction of STX17(142–228) with GABARAP and LC3A, respectively (Fig. 3 C and D and SI Appendix, Fig. S13 C and D), while the F189Q mutation does not affect the binding of STX17(142–228) to GABARAP and LC3A (Fig. 3 C and E and SI Appendix, Fig. S13 C and E), confirming that only the first putative LIR motif of STX17 is directly involved in the interactions with GABARAP and LC3A (Fig. 3 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S13 A and B).
LIR motif corresponds to the 172-175 “WETL” residues.
Fortunately, using the purified STX17(167–188)–GABARAP complex, we obtained good crystals that diffracted to 2.0-Å resolution.
Lack of electron density in the PDB shows disordered region.
To test this hypothesis, we first purified this autophagic SNARE complex, which includes the SNARE motifs of STX17 and VAMP8 together with their short neck regions, and the Qb- and Qc-SNARE motifs of SNAP29, and then used circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to examine its secondary structure features and thermal stability.
Using analytical gel filtration chromatography-based analyses, we showed that the Qb- and Qc-SNARE motifs of SNAP29 alone are unable to interact with or disturb the GABARAP–STX17 complex (SI Appendix, Fig. S18A); however, in the presence of an additional VAMP8 R-SNARE motif, a stable SNARE complex containing the STX17 Qa-SNARE motif, the VAMP8 R-SNARE motif, as well as the Qb- and Qc-SNARE motifs of SNAP29, was readily formed (SI Appendix, Fig. S18 B and C), indicating that SNAP29 and VAMP8 together can easily compete with GABARAP for binding to STX17 to assemble the STX17–SNAP29–VAMP8 SNARE complex.

In contrast to that of the isolated SNARE regions of STX17 and VAMP8 as well as the full-length SNAP29, the SNARE complex showed significant characteristic α-helical content, as indicated by its CD spectrum (Fig. 5A). 
In contrast to that of the isolated SNARE regions of STX17 and VAMP8 as well as the full-length SNAP29, the SNARE complex showed significant characteristic α-helical content, as indicated by its CD spectrum (Fig. 5A). It is noteworthy that the isolated SNARE region of STX17 is intrinsically disordered based on the CD analysis (Fig. 5A), consistent with the aforementioned NMR results (SI Appendix, Fig. S2).
In this model, STX17 alone is in an autoinhibited closed state and, particularly, its Habc region somehow packs with the N-terminal part of its Qa-SNARE motif to stabilize the intrinsically disordered SNARE motif of STX17, thereby preventing its unnecessary degradation or interactions with other proteins on the autophagosome before assembling the STX17–SNAP29–VAMP8 SNARE complex (Fig. 6). However, in the presence of GABARAP/LC3 family proteins, the mammalian ATG8 ortholog can competitively bind to the N-terminal part of the STX17 Qa-SNARE motif that contains an extended LIR motif and abolish the autoinhibited conformation of STX17 (Fig. 6), thereby releasing the N-terminal Habc domain of STX17 and inducing its conformational rearrangement. 
The region lacks electron density, as shown in the PDB, typical of IDR.
To confirm this, we collected its far-UV CD spectrum at pH 4.0 (Fig. 1A), which has the maximal negative signal located at ∼198 nm, indicating that in solution the hRTN3 N-terminus has no stable secondary structure.
Moreover, the hRTN3 N-terminus was further 15N isotope-labeled and assessed by 1H–15N NMR HSQC spectroscopy. As clearly seen in Fig. 1B, the hRTN3 N-terminus has a narrowly dispersed HSQC spectrum (∼0.9 ppm for 1H and 20.5 ppm for 15N dimensions). This observation again indicates that hRTN3 C-terminus is also lacking of any tight tertiary packing.
For the 44-residue hRTN3 C-terminus, we collected its far-UV CD spectra at both pH 4.0 and 6.5 (Fig. 1C), which had the maximal negative signals are located at ∼199 and ∼198 nm, respectively. This indicates that the hRTN3 C-terminus is also highly disordered without any stable secondary structure.
As seen in Fig. 1D, the hRTN3 C-terminus also has narrowly dispersed HSQC spectra at both pH 4.0 and 6.5 (∼0.65 ppm for 1H and 19.5 ppm for 15N dimensions), suggesting that the hRTN3 C-terminus is also lacking of any tight tertiary packing.
As seen in Fig. 3A, the binding of hRTN3-C44 to hFADD was associated with the heat absorbance (endothermic), implying that this binding may be mainly entropy-driven [18].
Fig. 3B presents the superimposition of the HSQC spectra of the 15N-labeled hRTN3-C44 in the absence (blue) and presence of hFADD at ratios of 1:1 (green) and 1:2 (red). The obtained result allowed the successful assignment of the perturbed hRTN3-C44 residues upon binding to hFADD.
Five N-terminal residues (92–96), the residues in two loops (248–250 and 331–334), and 11 C-terminal residues (371–381), which include the AIM motif, were not included in the final model due to poor electron density in these regions.
 Therefore, to visualize the interaction between PexRD54 and ATG8CL, we determined the crystal structure of ATG8CL in complex with a PexRD54 C-terminal pentapeptide. This pentapeptide includes the AIM motif, with residues Asp-377–Trp-378–Glu-379–Ile-380–Val-381.
Site-directed mutagenesis of the PexRD54 C-terminal AIM region, and ATG8CL binding to a PexRD54 AIM-based peptide array, mapped the key residues that define the PexRD54-ATG8CL interface.
First, we used alanine-scanning mutagenesis to substitute Ala at six positions in the PexRD54 AIM region, Pro-373, Asp-377, Trp-378, Glu-379, Ile-380, and Val-381. Each of these proteins was expressed and purified as described for wild type. We then used analytical gel filtration to qualitatively assay whether these variants support complex formation with ATG8CL. As predicted, we did not observe interaction of PexRD54 W378A with ATG8CL (Fig. 7). For each of the other mutations, we still observed an interaction with ATG8CL, including PexRD54 V381A.

The results of the peptide array clearly highlight the importance of the hydrophobic residues 378 and 381 of the PexRD54 AIM motif (Trp and Val) in binding ATG8CL. For position 378, the strongest binding was seen for Trp and Phe, with limited binding of Tyr and the aliphatic amino acids. Position 381 favors the bulky aliphatic amino acids, with limited binding also observed by bulky hydrophobic residues. Interestingly, with the exception of Pro at position 379, any amino acid can be accommodated at positions 379 and 380, and binding is still observed. Furthermore, any amino acid can be accommodated at positions 372–377 without a significant reduction in binding, suggesting that these residues may only act as a linker between the WY domain region of PexRD54 and the C-terminal AIM motif.

Finally, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to investigate the affinities of complex formation between PexRD54 and ATG8CL (Fig. 1C). Using this technique, we determined that PexRD54 binds to ATG8CL with a Kd of 388 ± 47 nm. The AIM motif disrupting PexRD54378-AEIA-381 variant (where the Trp and Val of the “WEIV” AIM motif are replaced by alanine) did not bind to ATG8CL using SPR, consistent with previous results (35).

Stable domains in Atg19 were identified by limited proteolysis of the full-length Atg19 (supplemental Fig. S1), which showed that Atg19 comprises at least two structurally stable domains, the N-terminal domain (residues 1–123) and the C-terminal domain (residues 254–367)
An additional in vitro pulldown assay showed that the coiled coil domain, but not the other two domains, of Atg19 is responsible for binding with the propeptide of prApe1 (Fig. 1B).
CD spectra of LD1, LD3 and LD5 peptides showed characteristics of random coil (Fig 2a, S3 Table) thus validating that the LD1, LD3 and LD5 motifs could exist as unfolded effector binding sites (not available for interaction) in our study and could fold upon undergoing allosteric changes after binding to their respective targets.
However, LD1, LD3, LD5, B2 and C3 do not show the characteristic peaks of secondary structures, thus may behave as unfolded effector binding sites.
LD1 region is comprised of residues 1–20.

Lack of electron density in this region, as shown in the PDB, is typical of IDR.
We expressed and purified the linker region between the kinase and SARAH domains of Mst1 (residues 326–401), which is also known as the inhibitory domain. By CD and one-dimensional NMR analysis (SI Fig. 8), we found that most of the residues in this region form a disordered structure, which can provide flexibility for domain motions in the Mst1 protein.
The helix and b-sheet contents of the purified linker region of Mst1 were calculated to be 20% and 3%, respectively. These CD data indicate a lack of regular secondary structure in the linker region of human Mst1.

All backbone amide signals appear in a narrow range near 8.0 ppm, and there are no aliphatic signals below 0.7 ppm, indicating the presence of an unfolded structure.
MST1 T353 and T367 peptides displayed high phospho-dependent binding affinities for MOB1A, with Kds of 280 nm and 680 nm for the phosphorylated peptides, respectively, and no detectable binding for the nonphosphorylated peptides (Fig. 2A).

As predicted by prior mutational data, the MST1 pT353 and pT367 phosphopeptides bound to the MOB1A phospho-binding pocket first identified by Rock et al. (22), with the phosphate of the P0 threonine directly coordinated by K153, R154 and R157.
In the final structure, we could well define the extreme C-terminal region including the second ‘CPXC’ motif of CALCOCO2 (residues 414–446, referred hereafter as “ZF2”) that consists of 2 anti-parallel β-strands and a C-terminal α-helix, but we could only define a short α-helix in the ZF1 domain due to its intrinsic dynamic property, whereas the remaining region was too flexible to be well defined (Fig. S2C and D).
Unfortunately, despite many attempts, we failed to solve the complex structure either using x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy, likely due to the weak and dynamic nature of this RB1CC1 Claw and NDP52 LIR interaction.
Further fragment truncation analyses together with AGFC-based assays elucidated that the LIR region of NDP52 (residues 129 to 141) can specifically interact with RB1CC1 Claw domain (Fig. 3D and fig. S7D).
To further confirm our hypothesis, we designed a series of NDP52 LIR mutations including the E130A, E131A, D132A, I133S, and V136R mutations of NDP52 LIR, which are corresponding to the critical Claw-binding E6, D7, D8, I9, and L12 residues of NAP1 FIR, respectively (Fig. 4A). As expected, using AGFC- and FP-based assays, we demonstrated that those mutations of NDP52 LIR all significantly disrupt the interaction between NDP52 LIR and RB1CC1 Claw (Fig. 3C and fig. S13, B to F).
(A-F) Analytical gel filtration chromatography-based analyses of the interactions of NDP52 LIR with LC3A (A), LC3B (B), LC3C (C), GABARAP (D), GABARAPL1 (E), and GABARAPL2 (F). These results indicate that NDP52 LIR can directly bind to six different mammalian ATG8 family proteins.
Further detailed analyses revealed that the NMR peaks corresponding to the LIR region of NDP52 in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of NDP52(10-141) show obvious changes when titrated with the Claw domain of RB1CC1 (Fig. 3G) but display little changes in the presence of RB1CC1(1286-1395) (Fig. 3H), further confirming that the LIR region of NDP52 is directly involved in the interaction with RB1CC1 Claw but not RB1CC1(1286-1395). Collectively, all these data clearly demonstrated that the LIR region of NDP52 contains another RB1CC1-binding site, which can specifically interact with the Claw domain of RB1CC1.
The LIR motif corresponds to de 133-136 residues.
Using in vitro phosphorylation assays, we confirmed that TBK1 can directly phosphorylate NDP52 (fig. S26). Our mass spectrometry (MS) analysis revealed that the conserved T137 residue within the NDP52 LIR region can be readily phosphorylated by TBK1 (Fig. 8A).
Together, all the above biochemical and structural results clearly demonstrated that TBK1-mediated phosphorylation of T137 in the LIR region of NDP52 can regulate the interactions of NDP52 with ATG8 family proteins.
Consistent with our structure and sequence analyses, further quantitative FP assays uncovered that the synthetic T137-phosphorylated NDP52 LIR peptide (“ENEEDILVVpTTQG,” referred to as phos-NDP52 LIR) displays a much stronger binding ability toward ATG8 family protein than that of the unphosphorylated NDP52 LIR peptide (Fig. 8B and fig. S23).
Notably, further FP-based assays revealed that the T137-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated NDP52 LIR peptides display similar binding affinities to the RB1CC1 Claw domain (fig. S27D), and the T137-phosphorylated NDP52 LIR peptide has a much higher binding affinity to LC3C than RB1CC1 (Fig. 8B and fig. S27D).
Supplementary material shows increasing binding affinities with  LC3A, LC3B, GABARAP, GABARAPL1, and GABARAPL2, when residue T137 is phosphorylated.
Since the NDP52 SKICH domain had been well assigned in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of NDP52(10-126) in our previous study (36), therefore, we could easily differentiate the NMR peaks corresponding to the LIR region from that of the SKICH domain in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of NDP52(10-141) by comparing the two 1H-15N HSQC spectra of NDP52(10-141) and NDP52(10-126) (fig. S8).
Figure S8 indicates that 127-141 is a disorder region.
Addition of unlabeled LC3C to 15N-labeled NDP52 (both at 150 μM) resulted in intensity attenuation of several resonances in the C-terminal region of NDP52, i.e., residues 130–140 (Figure 3B), indicating specific interaction of LC3C with this region, consistent with domain mapping data (Figure 3A). Quantification of signal intensities revealed that three residues, Leu134, Val135, and Val136, were attenuated most severely, suggesting they directly contribute to LC3C binding (Figure 3C).
To identify residues essential for the binding of LC3C in vitro, amino acids 132–137 of NDP52 were mutated individually to Ala or Ser in the context of full-length protein. Mutations of Leu134, Val135, or Val136, but not of Ile133 or other surrounding residues abrogated the interaction of NDP52 with LC3C in a LUMIER assay (Figure 3D).
To test the importance of the NDP52-LC3C interaction in vivo, we complemented cells lacking NDP52 with NDP52 alleles that differ in their ability to bind LC3C. Recruitment of LC3C and LC3B to S. Typhimurium was re-established upon complementation with wild-type NDP52 but not with NDP52 V136S, which demonstrates the crucial importance of the NDP52-LC3C interaction for antibacterial autophagy (Figure 3E).

These data, in combination with our NMR measurements, define the tripeptide Leu-Val-Val in the linker region between SKICH and coiled-coil domain as the essential CLIR motif for binding to LC3C. This tripeptide is predicted to form a β strand, like the canonical Trp-Xaa-Xaa-Leu LIR motif, but lacks the aromatic residue found in canonical LIR motifs (Figure 3F).
The CLIR peptide bound LC3C with a KD of 1.6 μM, while LC3A was bound with ∼10x lower affinity (15.1 μM) (Figures 5B and 5C). 
LC3C bound CLIRI133W with 14-fold higher affinity than the CLIRWT peptide, resulting in the highest affinity LC3 interaction reported so far (KD = 110 nM) (Figure 5B). Importantly, the CLIRI133W peptide also bound LC3A with high affinity (290 nM), which represents a > 50-fold improvement over CLIRWT (Figure 5C). However, the specificity of NDP52 for LC3C over LC3A, defined as the ratio of KD values, diminished from 10-fold to 3-fold (Figure 5C).
In contrast to the preferential interaction of wild-type NDP52 with LC3C, we observed strong and nonselective binding of NDP52I133W to all human ATG8 orthologs (Figure 5D). These data show that the NDP52 CLIR motif comprising a Leu-Val-Val sequence is able to distinguish efficiently between LC3C and its paralogs, and that mutation of the CLIR to utilize the aromatic pocket (CLIRI133W) enhances affinity but reduces the specificity for LC3C.
LC3C, Bound Selectively by a Noncanonical LIR Motif in NDP52, Is Required for Antibacterial Autophagy

Mutations of Leu134, Val135, or Val136, but not of Ile133 or other surrounding residues abrogated the interaction of NDP52 with LC3C in a LUMIER assay (Figure 3D).

The first 16 residues of Atg32[200–341] appeared disordered in the structure.
The N- and C-terminal-most residues and four flexible regions (residues 92–95, 249–253, 278–287, and 347–356) of RavZcrystal lacked defined electron density and were not modeled.

RavZ structures of both fragments are resolved from residues 47 to 433 and 48 to 432, respectively, whereas the missing regions at the N- and C-termini (residues 1–47 and 433–502) might be flexible and disordered.

The binding affinity between the N-terminal region of RavZ and LC3 was higher than that between the C-terminal region and LC3, and interestingly the single second LIR (LIR2) peptide had a similar binding affinity to LC3 as the intact N-terminal peptide containing the 2 LIRs, LIR1 and LIR2 (Fig. 1D). Although there are 2 LIR motifs in the N-terminal region, 2 molecules of LC3 cannot bind to this region simultaneously based on the SEC-MALS results, and the SRP data clearly showed that the LIR2 peptide had stronger binding affinity to LC3 than the LIR1 peptide. RavZ containing only the N-terminal LIRs, N-Cat, had similar binding affinity to LC3 as the single LIR2 peptide or N-terminal peptide, and the almost 50-fold stronger binding affinity between RavZ and LC3 might simply reflect a synergistically increased chance of the interaction.

The LC3-binding N- and C-terminal regions of RavZ are critical for inhibiting autophagy
We also performed the same experiments with point mutants, mutLIR1, mutLIR2 and mutLIR3, which possess a defect in LC3-binding (Fig. 3A). Based on our in vitro data, all double mutants formed a 1:1 complex with LC3 (Fig. 3B), and therefore must have a lower binding affinity compared with RavZ FL. Quantification of the fluorescence data indicated that a milder effect was shown by the point mutants compared with the deletion mutants (Fig. 4C), with different effects being observed with some of the point mutants.
In conclusion, the flexible N- and C-terminal regions in RavZ, and in particular the LIR motifs, are important for the recognition of LC3–PE conjugates and play a critical role in blocking autophagy in cells.

In conclusion, the flexible N- and C-terminal regions in RavZ, and in particular the LIR motifs, are important for the recognition of LC3–PE conjugates and play a critical role in blocking autophagy in cells.
Annotation related to the accessory LIR motif "FVTI".
This first crystal form provided a preliminary model and included an N-terminal stretch of 21 amino acid residues, which was presumably unstructured and could not be traced in the electron density.
The peptide used in this study is derivated from the Isoform 3 of this protein.
This region of the Isoform 1 lacks electron density, as shown in the PDB, typical of IDR.
In all preceding structures, the N-terminal residues leading from the initiator
methionine to the G domain were largely disordered. The conservation of this region across different species is strong within distinct isoforms, but highly divergent when isoforms within a particular species are compared with each other (Fig. 1 A).

Solution state NMR revealed that the C-terminal residues from Leu371 show very sharp 15N as well as 1H lines indicative of a highly flexible C-terminal part (data not shown).
All RDC values throughout the entire protein, apart from the additional C-terminal tail, which is missing in the crystal structure, are in good agreement with the crystal structure as reflected by the Q factor value (Q = 0.20) and by the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R = 0.96) (Fig. 4C).
In the complex the PAS-B domain adopts a well-defined globular fold (rmsdBackboneAtoms 260–367 = 0.485 Å) (Fig. 6A) ranging from Glu260 to Glu367 and a dynamically disordered tail at the C-terminus as confirmed by 15N-1H heteronuclear NOE values (SI Fig. 4).

For PIK3C3, point mutations of both the aromatic residue and the conserved hydrophobic position (F250A, V253A) of the core LIR-F250 motif (FELV, amino acids 250–253) appeared to significantly reduce binding to the Atg8 homologs.
Region corresponding to the LIR motif "FELV" at position 250-253
Here, the different Atg8 homologs were expressed as GST fusions in E. coli and then tested for interaction with in vitro translated PIK3C3, BECN1 and ATG14, respectively. All the members of PtdIns3K-C1, except PIK3R4, were able to interact with the Atg8 homologs (Figure 2). PIK3C3 and ATG14 showed significant interaction with LC3C and GABARAPL2, but the strongest interaction was seen with GABARAP and GABARAPL1. BECN1 only bound with significant affinity to GABARAP and GABARAPL1. Taken together, PIK3C3, BECN1 and ATG14 all interacted with the Atg8 homologs and appear to have a preference for binding to the GABARAP and GABARAPL1. For PIK3C3, point mutations of both the aromatic residue and the conserved hydrophobic position (F250A, V253A) of the core LIR-F250 motif (FELV, amino acids 250–253) appeared to significantly reduce binding to the Atg8 homologs. In contrast, mutating the core LIR-F198 motif (FREI, amino acids 198–201) in a similar manner (F198A, V201A) did not affect binding of PIK3C3 (Figure 2). This indicates that LIR-F250 of PIK3C3 is the functional LIR motif.

The N-terminal α1 helix of LC3C is disordered in our structure; it is possible that this helix is stabilized by acidic residues upstream of canonical LIRs (Noda et al., 2010).
Tha lack of electron density in this region, as shown in the PDB, indicates disorder.
The 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum of Tollip TBD was characteristic of an unstructured protein as indicated by the narrow dispersion in the 1HN dimension (Figure 1B).
Likewise, the far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of Tollip TBD displayed a minimum at 200 nm, a feature of unstructured protein spectra (Figure 1B, inset).
Titration of the unlabeled Tom1 GAT domain into the 15N-labeled Tollip TBD resulted in dramatic improvement in resonance dispersion (Figure 1C). Resonance perturbations clustered in the first half of Tollip TBD including two N-terminal β strands. The largest chemical-shift perturbations were observed in residues Arg9, Val12, Ile14, Asp20, and Arg23 (Figure 1D). 
We therefore measured the internal backbone motions of Tom1 GAT-bound Tollip TBD by analysis of the 1H-15N heteronuclear NOEs and the 15N relaxation times. The 1H-15N NOE profile showed that the first 22 residues of Tollip TBD were highly ordered, whereas the C-terminal half of the protein was disordered (Figure S2A).

The 1H-15N NOE profile showed that the first 22 residues of Tollip TBD were highly ordered, whereas the C-terminal half of the protein was disordered (Figure S2A).
Together, these data suggest that the conserved N-terminal Tollip TBD becomes ordered upon Tom1 GAT binding, whereas its C-terminal region remains relatively disordered.
Tollip TBD Is Intrinsically Disordered and Partially Folds upon Binding to the Tom1 GAT Domain.
Tollip TBD bound immobilized Tom1 GAT with high association and low dissociation rates, and with an estimated dissociation constant (KD) of 0.67 nM (Table 2 and Figure S4A).
Alanine mutations in Tollip TBD Arg9/Val12 and Asp20/Arg23 reduced Tom1 GAT binding (Table 2 and Figures S4K–S4L). Notably, mutation in Phe21, a conserved residue in Tollip (Figure S1A) that forms several intermolecular NOEs, and its NH backbone resonance is shifted when bound to the Tom1 GAT domain, reducing binding affinity by ∼20,000-fold (Table 2 and Figure S4M). Consequently, the affinity of Tom1 GAT N230A for Tollip TBD F21A showed ∼60,000-fold reduction in the equilibrium constant Kb (data not shown) leading to ∼95,000-fold reduction in binding (Table 2 and Figure S4N), suggesting that these residues reduce the affinity in the initial binding event, and consequently are critical for Tom1-Tollip complex formation.
Using isotopically labeled samples and 1H-15N HSQC NMR, we concluded that, as predicted, the Atg9 NTD (residues 1–285) is largely disordered in solution (Fig. 1C).
As expected, we observed a robust recruitment of Atg9-NTD(1–255) to the beads coated with EGFP-Atg11 (Fig. 3, A and B). Mutation of the first PLF motif (M1) severely reduced the interaction, and mutation of the second PLF motif (M2) reduced the recruitment of the Atg9-NTD to the EGFP-Atg11-coated beads (Fig. 3, A and B) to a similar extent. Upon mutation of both motifs (M1+M2), the interaction between the Atg9-NTD and Atg11 became undetectable (Fig. 3, A and B).
M1 motiff is comprised of the 158-171 region.
Titration of the wild-type Atg9-NTD(1–255) into full-length Atg11 yielded a robust signal, fitting of which resulted in a KD of around 1 μM and a stoichiometry of 1 (KD = 1,086 ± 0,006 μM, n = 0,931 ± 0,004, Fig. S4). The affinity of the Atg9-NTD(1–255) M1 and M2 mutants for Atg11 was too low to be measured accurately by ITC.

This titration in combination with the assignment allowed us to identify the putative binding site for Atg11 in the Atg9 NTD, which consists of two short stretches (Fig. 2A), both being centered on a PLF motif (Fig. 2B).

Truncated forms of survivin with only the BIR domain (residues 1−99) have been reported not to interact with Smac/Diablo ( 8) or to localize to the mitotic spindle ( 17). To understand the role of the C-terminal helix for the function of survivin, we cloned and expressed the (residues 1−99) BIR domain only construct. [15N,1H]HSQC spectra for the (residues 1−99) construct did not have the same well- resolved resonances found for full length survivin or our survivin(1−120) construct (data not shown). The lack of well-resolved resonances is characteristic of unfolded or aggregated proteins. This result suggests that the (1−99) construct of survivin is not properly folded. This conclusion is consistent with the structure of the survivin dimer. In the structure, residues 99−110 are involved in making contacts across the dimer interface. These contacts are likely to be important for dimer formation and thus also for protein stability. Removing these key residues is likely to interfere with proper folding of the protein.

The entirety of the Atg13350–525 construct evidenced rapid exchange in the absence of Atg1EAT (Fig. 1D), consistent with the expectation that this was an intrinsically disordered region.
To assess the binding affinity between Kl Atg1EAT and Atg13350–525, Atg1EAT was titrated into a cell containing Atg13350–525 (Fig. 1F). A dissociation constant (Kd) value of 125 ± 10 nM was obtained with n = 0.78 ± 0.02. Using Km Atg1EAT and Km Atg13460–521, a Kd value of 360 nM was independently obtained by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (28), in excellent agreement with our observations.
However, residues 417–426 of Atg13 had sharply reduced exchange in the presence of Atg1EAT, implicating this region as the primary binding site for Atg1.
On the basis of the SEC-MALS, a molecular mass of 234 kDa was independently obtained (Fig. S6B and Table S1), consistent with a predominant population of Atg1EAT–Atg13350–525–Atg17–Atg31–Atg29 dimers. Taken together with the ITC and HDX-MS data, these results led us to a model for the pathway of Atg1 complex assembly (Fig. 5).
Residues 261–265 and 637–647 in TFPα and residues 187–192 in TFPβ were not built, due to the lack of densities in these regions.
To gain insights into the dynamic properties of Atg1EAT in solution, we performed continuous-labeling HDX-MS (29–31). We initially measured deuteron incorporation into isolated Atg1EAT to analyze the overall kinetics of the HDX reaction. Atg1EAT exchanged about 60% of its exchangeable amide hydrogens within 10 s in D2O (Fig. 2 and Figs. S2–S4). The overall exchange characteristics indicate the presence of a large fraction of highly dynamic, solvent-accessible structure.

Not surprisingly, per-residue analysis revealed high T1 and T2 values for the unstructured tails of each partner (i.e., segments 84–85 and 149–155 in ZNHIT3 and segment 486–495 in NUFIP1) but also a significant increase in the α3-α4 loop of ZNHIT3.
However, the 17 C-terminal residues including most of the post-SET domain were not observed.

Outside the structured core, no long range distance restraints were observed for residues from Glu-359 to Ala-374 or from Glu-417 to Ser-433. The heteronuclear NOE values for these residues were less than 0.1 (Fig. 4), indicating that they are disordered in solution.
The authors are not considering the signal peptide, therefore the disordered region they mention corresponds to residues 385-400 and 443-459 of the Uniprot.

The amide 1H region (7.6–9.0 ppm) of the 1H NMR spectra in water at pH 5.1 and 5 °C shows little dispersion (Sup. Fig. 3A), suggesting that this peptide does not adopt a stable secondary structure in these conditions.
 Moreover, taking the 1HN signal of S4 at 8.6 ppm in water as a local reference for peptide 1, the lack of change in the chemical shifts suggests that the presence of the DPC micelles does not alter the chemical environment of peptide 1 (Sup. Fig. 6).

Next, we recorded 1D and 2D NMR spectra on peptide 2. The 1D 1H NMR spectrum in aqueous solution at pH 5.0, 5 °C shows little dispersion in the amide 1H region (8.50–8.75 ppm) (Sup. Fig. 3B), suggesting that peptide 2, like peptide 1, does not adopt a stable secondary structure.
The 1D 1H NMR spectrum of peptide 2 recorded in the presence of DPC micelles also reveals poor signal dispersion in the amide region, as shown in Sup. Fig. 5B. Interestingly, the presence of DPC micelles shifts all the 1HN resonances to higher field, including the signals of the glycines. This is shown in Sup. Fig. 8 which uses the 1HN signal of S21 at 8.24 ppm as a local reference. The analysis of the 1Hα, 13Cα and 13Cβ conformational chemical shifts, displayed in Fig. 5B and Table 1, indicates that peptide 2 partially adopts a helical conformation. The helical population is 22% considering the whole peptide and reaches 53% for the segment spanning residues P16 to Y22 (Table 1).

Further, using a series of circular dichroism spectroscopic experiments, we validate the cytosolic region as an intrinsically disordered protein region. 
We experimentally validated NS4B-CR peptide to remain in disordered conformation in buffered conditions. Far-UV CD spectrum where negative ellipticity near 198 nm is indicative of its flexible nature is shown in Fig. 8A.
The cytosolic region NS4B-CR (residues 131–169) of Zika virus NS4B protein corresponds to residues 2396-2434 of Zika virus Genome polyprotein.
To analyze the ability of NS4B-CR peptide to interact with cellular lipid molecules, we studied its behavior in the presence of lipids and artiﬁcial membrane forming SDS micelles (Tulumello and Deber, 2009). As shown in Fig. 9A and B, the maximum negative ellipticity of CD spectra of NS4B-CR peptide under the influence of SDS micelles shifts from wavelength 198.5 nm to 201.6 nm. This indicates the formation of a pre-molten globule structure in SDS.

We measured the 15N relaxation parameters (Figure S2), which is typical of a dimer and allowed us to distinguish different dynamic regions: (i) a highly flexible disordered region observed for residues 1–23, (ii) a transition disordered region from residue 24 to 35, (iii) a globular ordered region from residue 36 to 98, and (iv) a flexible C-terminus (residues 99–104).

Several portions of the structure were not traceable owing to poor observed electron density; in addition to the extreme termini (residues 1–15 and 404–406, respectively), this also applies to loop segments 108–110 and 173–180.
Furthermore, the domain II carries unresolved portion of the structure: residues 281QIGSSA286 (SmADSL-AMP) and 281QIGSSAMPY289 (SmADSL-Apo) are on a disordered loop. This loop contains the signature sequence 281Q*GSS*MP*K*NP293 unique to the β-elimination superfamily [12].

Molecule A has three disordered, presumably flexible loops, comprising residues 251-263, 551-579, 614-625. Molecule B has five loops missing, between 227 and 234, 250 and 263, 551 and 578, 617 and 625, and 632 and 637.

In both the T. brucei and L. mexicana aldolases, the 11 Cterminal residues were not visible in the density of any subunit.
For the first 44 and the last residue – Leu605 – of PGI-Lm (Fig. 2), no electron density was distinguishable in the 2σA|Fo|-D|Fc| map of both chains of the homodimer. The absence of continuous electron density for residues 1–44 indicates that the N-terminal sequence is not ordered. Based on the electron density map and sequence alignment, four additional residues (Val45 to Ser48) could be added to that region of PGI-Lm (Fig. 2).
The terminal residues 1–7 and 336–350 as well as the C-terminal His-tag were not built into the structure models due to the lack of interpretable electron density
The PDB shows this region constitutes the IDR conserved by all chains obtained.
The dynamic loop (residues 52–71) was found to adopt an engaged conformation (Fig. 4b), in contrast to the apoenzyme structure where the dynamic loop was found to be disordered in two of the chains.
As a result of this rotation, the dynamic loop (residues 52–71) is pulled out from the active site in a canonical “disengaged conformation” [33], which is stabilized by the diagonal subunit.

The “disengaged-conformation” (in which most of the loop is disordered in the AMP-bound structure) is prevented from adopting an active conformation by the strong hydrogen bonded network around Arg48 which hydrogen bonds to the dynamic loop (residue 52) (Fig. 5d) and pointing the remainder of the loop out into solvent.

Immediately after removal of Gdn and initiating the aggregation process, the CD spectra of both CsgA and CsgB are characteristic of a random coil with a minimum close to 200 nm and little signal elsewhere.
In contrast, the CD signal of CsgB rapidly increased at 200 nm and decreased at 216 nm, indicating the appearance of β-sheet structure (Fig. 3B). The CD change of CsgB at either 200 nm or 216 nm could be fit by a single exponential function with a half-time of 180 min (Fig. 3E and Table 1).
However, the intrinsic fluorescence of CsgB alone, excited at 280 nm, shows an exponential decrease as a function of time (Fig. 6F) with a rate constant similar to the change in CD signal (Fig. 3E), confirming that the structure of CsgB rapidly changes with a single exponential rate during its aggregation.
Fig. 1A shows the time dependence for CsgB aggregation as a function of CsgB concentration.
Seeds (oligomers) of CsgB abolished the lag phase of CsgA and of CsgB (Fig. 2 A and B). The results suggest that CsgB oligomers accelerate CsgA aggregation.
CsgA is unable to polymerize in the absence of CsgB; thus, in the absence of either CsgA or CsgB, no surface structures are observed (5). 
In these experiments the CD changes were fit by a two-exponential function (Table 1). Interestingly, the rate constant for the first phase is near that of CsgB alone (Table 1), suggesting that this fast phase is mostly due to the rapid polymerization of CsgB. Thus, it is clear that CsgB rapidly forms oligomers that change the aggregation mechanism of CsgA.
Immediately after removal of Gdn and initiating the aggregation process, the CD spectra of both CsgA and CsgB are characteristic of a random coil with a minimum close to 200 nm and little signal elsewhere.
The effect of monomeric CsgB on the aggregation of CsgA was investigated using the ThT assay. A 1:1 mixture of monomeric CsgA and CsgB (4 μM each) was observed to have a lag phase similar to that of CsgB alone over the first 100 min (Fig. 1B). Thus, the lag phase typical of CsgA alone disappeared (Fig. 1B). 
The intrinsic fluorescence of CsgA alone, excited at 280 nm, shows a small linear decrease over time, monitored by either tyrosine or tryptophan signal (Fig. 6E), which is probably due to the loss of soluble protein during the aggregation process.
At very long times (9–13 d), the CD spectrum of CsgA shows a weak minimum signal at ~220 nm, rather than at 216 nm, but probably characteristic of some β-sheet structures (Fig. 3 C and D).
Immediately after elution from the nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) agarose column, solutions containing purified CsgA-his were clear with no evidence of aggregation, and EM of this material revealed no fibers (9). CD analysis of this material indicated that soluble CsgA-his, unlike curli, was not rich in β-sheet secondary structure (Fig. 4C).
However, after prolonged incubation (4°C for 4 to 12 hours), the CsgA-his solutions became opaque and noticeably viscous. EM analysis revealed that fibers had formed that were similar to those produced by wild-type bacteria (Fig. 4D).
Circular dichroism spectrum indicated that immediately after purification, CsgA was largely unstructured (Fig. 1B).

We tested the hypothesis that preformed CsgA fibers could catalyze CsgA polymerization. The addition of 2.5% (w/w) sonicated CsgA fibers to freshly purified, soluble CsgA resulted in a significant reduction of the lag phase (Fig. 3A).
Moreover, additionally to region P253-E303 removed from the recombinant protein, electron density was missing for residues A304 to P323 in both monomers, suggesting potential flexibility of this region.
These results suggest LiSir2rp1 is composed of two tightly associated proteolytically stable polypeptides (nominally 29 kDa N-terminal and 9 kDa C-terminal) linked minimally by a 17 residue surface-exposed, serine-rich peptide region 268–284, EGRSSSSQSRSPSASPR.

Importantly, structures of terminal tails of several essential eIFs in most of the available cryo-EM reconstructions are also lacking, mainly due to their intrinsic flexibility. Among them stand out the terminal tails of the c and d subunits of eIF3, eIF2β, eIF1, and eIF1A, which are all critically involved in scanning and AUG recognition.
The Putative eukaryotic translation initiation factor 1A (eIF1A) takes part in the 43S preinitiation complex from Trypanosoma cruzi with the kDDX60 helicase and the  cryo-EM reconstruction corresponds to the entire complex.
The flexible loop at 671–680 was rarely observed in electron density maps and was not included in the final models of SmTK chain A, SmTK-Arg chain A, and SmTK-TSA chain B.
Segment 671–680 of the C-terminal region of D2 is not visible in electron density maps (Fig. 1B).
The loop is delineated by two glycine residues (Gly670–Gly681) that account for its high flexibility.
The flexible loop is in red in D1 and shown with a dotted line in D2 because it is not observed in the electronic density maps. 
A Mg2+ ion is only observed in the active site of D1, and the flexible loop is disordered in both lobes.
The disordered conformation of this loop observed in D2 allows equal access to the active site and is consistent with solution NMR measurements performed with AK (68) and CK (30).
